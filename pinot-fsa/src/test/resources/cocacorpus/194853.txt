When hanging or leaning art on the wall , the already narrow space seems to become even more narrow .

@@99057482 @3257482/ <h> To Waterfall or Not To Waterfall <p> By Kate Riley April 23 , 2015 <p> Yesterday I returned from a quick trip to visit the folks in Las Vegas and check on the progress of the fixer upper , things are moving along in the kitchen , I found my dream backsplash and the fabricators I hired came out to make the template for the new countertops . I finally made a decision on the solid surface , I envisioned white quartz from the start so I 'll be working with Caesarstone in Pure White , it will be so beautiful when complete , I 'll share that next month . <p> Meanwhile I have a decision to make on the edge of the peninsula and whether I should add a waterfall edge or not , here 's a quick iPhone pic I took this week ( see actual colors of the cabinets and another view of the peninsula here . ) <p> I have the choice between a classic horizontal surface that ends here or I could have it drop down to the floor with a waterfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary so a waterfall could look amazing it would be striking to look at you enter the kitchen , and would have a return where two counter stools sit on the other side . <p> I 'm torn for reasons shared below , but first a look at some waterfall edges to collectively drool over . <p> I lean toward the waterfall edge since 1 ) it 's awesome and 2 ) it will hide that contrast between the blue/gray cabinet and pony wall . I lean against it because of the angle of the peninsula , I 'm not 100% convinced it will look right since it will only be on this one side and it requires a return . Personally I prefer the look of a waterfall edge when the look is two sided and symmetrical on an island . Also are waterfall edges trendy ? Will we still be loving them in 10 years , or are they a new classic ? What say you ? <h> 103 comments <p> Suzanne Dimma from Canadian House &amp; Home included a waterfall edge on her kitchen island , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for some reason I do n't  recall , but I think her designer husband may have suggested it ) . And she is so good at the fine details , I would check it out before you commit . <p> I 'm not a fan of the waterfall and I do think its too trendy . Although I can see your point about hiding where the two walls merge . I 'm sure you 'll come up with a clever idea to hide those walls even if you do n't  use the waterfall edge . <p> I looked at some single-sided waterfalls online , and they always look so much more clean , sleek and beautiful , compared to a non-waterfall . I would recommend doing the waterfall , and I think it will look very nice in your kitchen . <p> I am an engineer and typically super analytical about symmetry and not a huge fan of the more modern looking waterfall edges . However , in this scenario , I do prefer the white waterfall edge on the end cap to hide the wall/cabinet transition and the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . I especially like the thinner stone applications , like the Rosemount Kitchens &amp; Style at Home examples . The thinner stones look less trendy to me , but in a good way . I may be swaying you in the opposite direction with my analysis . : ) <p> I too say go for it . This is your 2nd home and I think that warrants going big , or going home ( to the other one : ) ) Besides , by the time it is " out of vogue " the whole look will be out and you will have to revamp it all anyway . I say , live life on the edgethe waterfall edge . <p> I 'm loving how the kitchen is coming together ! You always create such gorgeous spaces ! As far as the waterfall edge , here 's my two cents I think it would look better on an island where it comes down on both sides . I think it may look off balanced here . Ive been seeing lots of waterfall edges lately and , while they are gorgeous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look dated in a few years . Seriously , though , I know whatever you decide will turn out beautifully ! <p> I guess it really depends on if you want to spend the money on the extra material that you will never use . : ) We just had that issue when we redid our kitchen island . We went with Alaskan White Granite . It would have meant purchasing another slab and in all honesty I think its a bit busy to bring all the way to the floor . We did go with a 2 inch edge that makes it look and feel substantial . It will look great either way . <p> I was not aware there was even anything like this ! I really like it ! I think it is clean and sleek looking and I think it is the perfect design solution for that transition from pony wall to cabinet . I also agree , that corner will be a busy place . Having the Caesarstone will hold up better to foot kicks . I think it will be such nice finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pic from . I do n't  understand what you mean by " it will have a return where 2 counter stools will sit on the other side " I thick I prefer the chunkier look-it looks more substantial , like a table would be , whereas the thinner ones look like they are n't  w=strong enough to hold up that edge . I say go for it ! <p> The chunkier Caesarstone ones remind me of a Parsons table , which is a classic shape and does n't  go out of style ! But if you 're nervous , I agree that the thinner ones look less trendy . Either way , I say go for it ! <p> so , yah that was exactly the word i was going to use trendy. are they beautiful ? yes , but there is not question it is a trend now . not as bad as an over sized talking heads shoulder pads trend , but still . also , without it being on both sides i think it may feel heavy on the waterfall side ? less esthetically peaceful because of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decide ! thanks for sharing the pics. i so enjoy . <p> One other thing to consider with the waterfall edge is that the back of the quartz is stamped/printed with their brand name . So you will need to find a way to finish the raw backside edge seen where the seating is . It may be you add an additional piece the width of your overhang and sandwich them together so the polished face is facing stool . Just food for thought . <p> I like the look of the waterfall edge , but I 'm pretty sure it will look dated in 5-10 years . If that does n't  bother you , go for it . It really depends on how you feel about it . Some people care , some do n't  . We got gold fixtures/hardware everywhere in 1999 and I 'm dying to change it all out , even though gold is back . I now skip all trends and just try to go classic , or do something a little different so that it never looks dated . For example , when a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terracotta reddish color that still does n't  look dated . <p> I 'm a fan of the waterfall ! I have an island that just has the granite countertop and the cabinet showing . My cabinet has a laminate on it and over the years is now chipping away on the bottom . This idea is not only pretty but functional ! <p> the waterfall is big here in australia when its paired with sleek modern cabinets . i love your choices so far but years ago i had pure white corian countertops and , if you are a clean freak , you may wish to go with a white combined with flecks of something else . every single crumb or dog hair shows up . it REALLY bugged me. for resale though , the clean white look is appealing . <p> Hi Kate ! Its not really my decision because you need to do whatever makes you happy , but I vote in the NO column and echo some of the other responses . This is a very trendy look . It will date your kitchen faster than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heavy look visually . I think it drags down the counter and makes it look too large for the space . Third , it is just another added expense that is n't really that functional . Put your extra $$ into something that will really wow , even if it is just using an artsy glass bowl for pop of color on the counter . Whatever you decide , good luck with your project ! <p> If it was me , I would do it ! I think it really does solve the problem of the junction of the two surfaces there , and as others pointed out , it is a sturdy surface that will stand up to the busy comings and goings in the kitchen . Is it " trendy " ? Yep ! But I think this sort of trend is a long term one and not something that will be out in a few years but moe like 10 years . It is no more " trendy " than having two toned cabinets in the kitchen : ) <p> Wow , your project is looking beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall . However , the more I look at it , the more I would first try to envision the pony wall and white/gray contrast as being all one seamless color and texture . Your eye goes right to that area ( where the gray cabinet meets the pony wall ) because the harsh contrast in color and texture with the base trim . Can you achieve a smooth , one color island base without doing the waterfall ? Maybe use your gray cabinet paint on the pony wall and continue the base trim so it all looks like cabinetry . If not , go for the waterfall . That area needs to blend better in my opinion . Good luck ! No matter what your decision , it will be gorgeous ! One quick additionif you choose to do the waterfall , check the stool space , definitely constricts that area . Thanks for sharing : ) <p> I had a house fire2013 , my contractor talked me out of a waterfall edge on the kitchen peninsula , as its code here that the end of penninsula MUST gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixer .. I miss the waterfall edgethe inspector said its very costY to drill thru marble ( my choice ) as opposed to granite , harder .. I listened .. Love my marble even if softer material. ( been around for centuries , ) <p> Gosh I hate myself for saying this , but I vote no . The angles plus the fact that it may not appeal/be trendy after some time makes me lean no . If it was going to be your space to love then I would say yes ! All in ! No matter what , it will be beautiful . Good luck ! <p> I think in this kitchen it would not be my choice due to the angles of the peninsula . It looks good on an island because of the symmetry . In that situation , and in a contemporary style kitchen it would not be dated because it very much resembles a classic parsons table which has never gone out of style . But I fear on this bar , it would become dated besides looking odd . <p> personally , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendy . i also like symmetry and do n't  know that it would work in your situation . on the other hand you can make anything look great ! so i 'm sure you 'll make the right choice ( : <p> I say " no " even though I do like some of the pictures you show , I think it will be outdated in a few yearsand , since its one-sided ; I just would n't like it . Love what you 've done so farcant wait either to see the finished work ! <p> In your own home , I 'd vote yes , but you might do without it in a property you hope to sell . I 'm making a completely uneducated guess that it wo n't add to your eventual selling price . Boring pragmatism rules here : ) . <p> I say no , if you are planning on reselling . I am not a fan AT ALL ( even though I 'm usually the first to jump on a trend ! ) and I do n't  think it has universal appeal . I love the contrast of cabinets with countertops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of countertop ! And I have a feeling these will be the harvest gold or avocado green of our time ! <p> I love me some good stone , but I have to say , I 'm not in love with the waterfall look . Its VERY modern looking ( especially in some of your examples ) , and I do n't  think it will appeal as well to all potential buyers . That said , the ones that are more of a solid color are definitely easier on the eyes , than the ones that have the grain . I think the latter looks busy , and takes away from the other gorgeous things going on . I will caveat my opinion by saying that I 'm definitely a more traditional gal when it comes to kitchens and bathrooms , mostly because ( as you mentioned ) stuff WILL go out of style , and since kitchens and baths only get redone every 10-15 years , I like to keep styles that are more classic . I generally love all your design ideas , but I 'm not sold on this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to use a solid color stone , I think you could do it , but anything with a grain might look odd , because it draws your eyes to it . Looking forward to seeing the finished result , whatever you choose : o ) <p> I was surprised at how many responses you have that said " do it " . I think its trendy and not worth the extra expense . I like that the cabinets are a different color , and seeing them from the side like that is not a negative . However , trying to put too much into that small kitchen will make it look garish . Skip the waterfall . Concentrate on something else for a focal point , like the back splash . <p> Since you are going for a contemporary look I think the waterfall would help you achieve this . I think it would look good on this angle ! Trust whatever your gut says because , girl , you " ve got rockstar design instincts ! : - ) <p> I have to vote no . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clean lines and flat faced cabinets . In that setting I do n't  think it will read trendy in 10 years . Your kitchen is not contemporary . If you add it to the shaker cabinets in ten years it will look like you jumped on on the waterfall band wagon and your kitchen will look dated . I appreciate that you are trying to hide the cabinet pony wall transition , it does bother me too , I think a better investment would be a shaker style panel covering the side of the cabinet and the end of the pony wall . That would keep all the elements classic , thus timeless . <p> I am amazed at the number of responses which say " too trendy . " These must be people who are too young to remember the parsons table as a kind of trend in the 60s and 70s , but was then , and still is a classic . <p> Great kitchen classic details ! I personally would vote against a waterfall edge . I think it is a trend that adds too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic . Another option might be to add a cabinet detail to the end of your peninsula where the wall and cabinets come together covering both the wall and cabinet either painted white or the cabinet color . In my kitchen , we built a bookcase to fit the dimensions . It gives me a place for display and holds my favorite cookbooks as well as it bridged the gap of the wall/cabinets seamlessly . Good luck with your decision ! Ruth <p> I 'm not at all attracted to a waterfall edge . Too modern and trendy , too " boxy " and , to me , downright " clunky " . ( I do remember Parsons tables and I love them in their place . ) I think the waterfall edge calls all the attention to itself , but what 's appealing about a big overturned box in the middle of your otherwise very lovely kitchen ? I know you 'll make a considered decision , however , and it will all come out beautiful . I love everything else you 've done in the kitchen and the breakfast area and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall edges youve shared ! I agree with some of the other commentators re : it can look modern but I think this is a great place to go for it ! Love that it would hide those mismatching edges and it would finish off the counter nicely . I think waterfall edges might be trendy now but due to their practicality , they are totally here to stay . Cheers ! <p> The waterfall edge is a great look but my concern is for the front of the island were the stools are . The front of my island always has foot prints . Would the stone look good on the front of the island to prevent foot prints . <p> I do n't  mind the look of it ( I do think its more trendy and less timeless though ) but I do think it works best on an island where its symetrical . The ones that I 'm drawn to in the pics above really anchor the island in the room and it works well with the surrounding kitchen . I think for the Las Vegas kitchen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do agree with others about finishing off the end with some type of cabinetry so that it looks like a built in . <p> Hi Kate I cant wait to see the Ceasarstone . I agree with your concerns about the waterfall edge . They are lovely but perhaps not right for the angle you have there . Have you considered an alternate disguise for that pony wall ? I think it would look fabulous if you framed out the small edge of the pony wall and the end of the base cabinet unit to match the detail on your cabinet doors and drawers . I look forward to seeing the counter installed and good luck ! <p> I love the contrast colors of the pony wall and cabinets but also know this will be an area of lots of wear and tear not to mention the head banging for kiddos . That being said I do n't  care for the waterfall way too trendy . And an expense that may not pay off on a house you are planning to flip . <p> Waterfall ! ! I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the counter also takes a beating from traffic and you wint need to worry about wear and tear not to mention it will look uber cool ! ! <p> I have it in white quartz and I could not be happier . I do not care if it may be trendy because right now , I am in heaven and every single person who walks in my house compliments me on it . Not that this matters , what matters is that I love it . And I only have it on one side , as the peninsula hits the wall on the other side . It is gorgeous ! <p> As much as it pains me to say this , I think the waterfall edge would look really nice . Youve got some nice square-ish shapes going with the cabinets and drawer fronts , and the finished edges of the waterfall would complement nicely . On the other hand . . . the waterfall edge might make an attractive nuisance for little ones with paints and crayons : ) <p> I did n't  but wish I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supplier and there was just not enough to do the waterfall . In hindsight I should have sourced another piece . I do n't  think the look is trendy or will date I just think it looks finished and luxe . <p> It looks pretty-and modern-but if people are sitting in the end stools I bet its a pain for them to leave the table/counter with that " wall " in the way-especially if the stools swivel . I 'd go with function and say no . <p> I say yes to the waterfall . It will give it a nice clean edge , save space on the passageway into the kitchen and just nicely set off the peninsula . Plus , I think not having a that countertop corner sticking out will prevent a lot of little kid head injuries . <p> I agree , that end of the cabinet needs something . I 'm not sure about the waterfall , though . Like you I like the symmetry of a waterfall edge on both ends . <p> What if you framed out that end of the cabinet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like wainscoting ? Then you could paint the whole thing the base cabinet color without having that edge of the pony wall to contend with . You could even extend the wainscoting across the pony wall . Would that be too traditional for the style you 're going for ? 23102 @qwx883102

I ended my brief European tour there ( after visting- Paris and Salzburg ) , it was my second visit to the city and I loved it just as much as the first time . <p> Munich 's world famous Oktoberfest has just ended and from friends who have visited , I hear it 's a blast , crowded and expensive during the festival , but very fun . <p> I visited in July when the- summer tourists are there but it 's not nearly as crowded as Oktoberfest . Munich is a walkable city , you 'll find much to do in the Old Town and something charming to see around every corner . I spent three full days in Munich over the summer , here were the highlights and some recommended things to do ! <h> Biergartens and Markets <p> Munich is a treat for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salads and krauts and sausages you can and do your best to eat as much strudel too , the Germans take this delicious dessert seriously and do it well ! You 'll find great restaurants all over town with authentic German fare , and a feast at Viktualien Market where dozens of vendors sell their specialty goods . Nestled in the center is a biergarten where tourists and locals mingle . Kennedy 's is a fun pub to hang out in the evening . <h> Marienplatz Walk <p> The historical square is lovely to see , along a variety of streets you 'll find shops and restaurants housed in baroque buildings , and many historical sites like the famous Glockenspiel and Hofbr+uhaus . <h> Historic Sights and Gardens <p> This is the second time I 've done Mike 's Bikes tour and it 's a great way to get a good look at Munich with a knowledgeable tour guide . Highlights of the tour are some historical buildings in the Old Town and the English Garden , a 900 acre landscaped public space with a beautiful fountains and vistas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can watch the Eisbach river surfer 's too . <p> On our last day we got in the spirit by renting Bavarian attire .

Prost ! <h> 11 comments <p> Hi there , you can delete my comment after reading I just want to tell you about some mistakes you made in this post . First you mention to eat streudel , there is no such thing . Either you mean Streusel or Strudel , probably the second . Then you mention the Haufbrauhaus , but it is called Hofbr+uhaus , if you can not write the + then you turn it into an ae then it is Hofbraeuhaus . Last but not least : Dirndl and Lederhosen are written with a capital D and L.

I took German classes when I was in high school , but 20 years later I do n't  remember enough to make my way to anything but a biergarten or ask for a pencil ! My husband and I are targeting heading here for Oktoberfest in a matter of years though , so thanks for the tips ! <p> I cant speak for Kate but I have family in Germany &amp; they teach school children English from an early age ( much like our kids learn math , science , etc in school ) . I found that finding an English speaking person was not hard for me , esp in a big city . Have fun on your trip !

Visiting Christmas markets on crisp , chilly days , sipping warm gl++hwein from the holiday-themed mugs ( I have a collection of them now ! ) and nibbling on hot sausages or crepes is a fun memory . The big Marienplatz Christkindlmarkt is a must , even if its a little touristy but there are smaller markets throughout the city , each with their own personality , depending on the neighborhood . Public transportation is great so its an easy city to get around in . <p> I am really glad you enjoyed Munich and you took wonderful pictures ! Also , I have to say that you are my favorite kind of visitor . I am used to a lot of people who are visiting who just want to shop or to get drunk at Wiesnzeit ( " Wiesn " means Oktoberfest and is so much faster to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case read of ) people who are genuinely interested in my town and also want to see and feel what it is like to live here , I always get really giddy : ) Thank you for your post ! <p> I am from the United Arab Emirates and Ive always visited Munich for 2-4 weeks almost every year and sometimes twice a year , I love it so much !

@@99057485 @3257485/ <h> Builder Grade to Floating Vanity <p> By Kate Riley January 5 , 2015 <p> Welcome back to a new year and a brand new week ! First I must say " Yay for the return of Downton Abbey ! " I 've ignored all spoilers and enjoyed the beginning of Season 5 last night with a cup of tea as a Sunday evening January tradition ! <p> I thought I 'd kick off the year with one of the projects we completed during our holiday stay at the fixer house in Las Vegas . A few months ago I posted about plans for the master bathroom vanity and went back and forth between stain and paint but opted for gray paint for two reasons . 1 ) I 've had mixed success staining oak , often it enhances the grain and always requires stripping varnish which is more work . 2 ) Since natural light comes only from adjacent rooms it made sense to go with a pale paint instead of dark stain in this vanity space . <p> We began this remodel by repurposing instead of replacing the existing vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countertop , we updated by transforming the builder grade cabinet into a floating vanity raised to a 33 ? height . <p> To achieve the look and new height , first we extended the floor tile so that it would continue all the way to the back wall . My Dad helped Matt modify and install the cabinet . They cut off the old base with a jigsaw so only the vanity cabinet remained . <p> Next they hoisted up the vanity so that it sat at a new height of 33 ? ( with countertop and plywood base it will be 34 -+ " ) instead of the old 29 ? height which felt too low . <p> The guys secured it to the wall with the help of 2x4s . They added " legs " in the corners and 2+4 boards along the back to support the base , making sure there was enough space for the plumbing to clear the bottom of the cabinet base at its raised height . Additional 2x4s helped secure the sides of the vanity cabinet to the wall to the studs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as nice as the raised panel cabinet doors were , I thought I 'd experiment and swap the door fronts , flipping around the back to expose the Shaker style instead . <p> I filled in any cracks and the holes from where the old hinges were attached with spackling then sanded it before priming . <p> I also beveled the edges of the drawer fronts , removing the curved ogee edge with an orbital sander so they were refinished as curved and smooth . <p> Primer and paint assisted with the disguised reversed doors and sanded drawer fronts , I 'm so pleased with the outcome ! <p> I followed the same steps for painting as with this bathroom cabinet makeover priming first with Zinssers oil based bonding primer then following up with Benjamin Moore paint in Winter Solstice , a pale grey with a hint of blue . Since the wood is oak in this case , I applied two coats of primer and three coats of paint to help fill in the grain . <p> To hide the exposed plumbing pipe and 2+4 supports I added a 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm going to change out the exposed hinges in the near future for hidden ones , for now I just painted over the old ones . We pulled out both of the old medicine cabinets and brass ring towel holders and replaced the medicine cabinet on the right of the vanity with a modern beveled edge version , the hole on the left will be framed and patched with sheetrock to make room for a longer towel bar instead , leaving room for art above . <p> Chrome fixtures , tile , - and oval white mirrors will finish off the vanity area . <p> Were going back and forth on replacing the tile in the shower room its basic 4+4 white ceramic tile , old and a bit plain for a master bathroom . Ill post an update if we go forward with a remodel in there . <p> My next step is to find the perfect white countertop , my research continues on the best solid surface for the space ! <h> 32 comments <p> This is an amazing transformation ! I love the idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely new set of cabinets ! I might have to " steal " that idea ! Great idea , cant wait to see the finished bathroom ! <p> Love this !

I like how clean the lines of the Shaker side are . Great decision to paint and the color is beautiful . Ca n't wait to see the gorgeous finished bathroom . <p> On another note , after painting a few pieces of oak furniture and not loving the result I tried a grain filler the last time .

On the other hand , my heart is n't in the work of painting them myself just to turn around and sell , not to mention I do n't  know what may or may not be attractive to a buyer color wise . We have other areas that will need professional attention , so I hate to spend money to have them painted . Any thoughts on how high a priority this ? ? ?

In other words , when you open the cabinet , is it all painted inside too , or just the inside of the door , or nothing ? ? ? <p> I never thanked you for this in the past , but we used your idea and transformed our kitchen peninsula into an island . We added a butcher block countertop from IKEA and it completely transformed and updated our kitchen and lay out . Thank you . : ) <p> Love what you 're doing with the bathroom !

My sisters NEW kitchen cabinets , came with the doors " flipped " she said " look how pretty they are inside " . While I LOVE a higher vanity ( I had my hubby raise ours , but with a base ) , from a practical standpoint , I could n't do a " floating " one . All it would accomplish in my house would be to provide a home for dust bunnies . And who needs more tile to mop , and at an uncomfortable angle ?

Many homes and apartments lack a built-in entertainment center , so the console or media stand is the next best thing for supporting the TV and housing media equipment . <p> Several years ago I shared 9 ways to design around a TVbut today the focus is on one of the most popular solutions : the media stand . No wonder so many retailers sell several versions , they 're in high demand ! Styling a media stand or console can prove a challenge , I prefer simplicity myself but there are many different ways to pull off a stylish display of your own . <p> One of my favorite looks is- a symmetrical art display around the TV , I did this recently for the shelter family room . Art or photographs that share commonality combined with matching frames is a no fail way to style a wall around television . <p> Here are two opposite yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and symmetrical stacked books , lamps , and dishes , the second image is a more zen approach with layered accents in soothing neutral tones . <h> 11 comments <p> I love the symmetrical look of the gallery walls with all of the art prints . I guess I am just drawn to symmetry . I recently did my T.V. wall . I love the mix of my French weathered buffet , blue and white chinoiserie , floor to ceiling shutters , and beautiful candle sconces . Its symmetrical . Love all of this great inspiration ! <p> My favourites are the first one for its simplicity and the one with the tv on the black wall . It just disappears . I am not a fan of all the artwork around the tv because I admit I like to watch it and I think all the artwork would be distracting <p> Loved seeing all the ways people have decorated around their tv . What struck me the most is that I think my very own husband has bamboozled me into believing that some big speaker " has " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowhere in these photos did I see one of these speakers . That one speaker ruins all symmetry on top of the console and now I learn that it does n't  even have to be there . I see some various knick knacks in the not too distant future on that console . <p> I agree with Eileen above . My favorite one is the 1st one for its simplicity . I think that the artwork surrounding it would be distracting when watching TV ( especially in the last pic ) and I also do n't  care for making the TV part of the decor of a room . <p> This is such a great post as was the one you did 9 years ago and the one Maria Killam just did in July . With all the easy , practical , dramatic and beautiful solutions out there , nobody has an excuse these days . My favorite is the Pottery Barn pic as the TV hung among all the black and white pix in their black and white frames and the other coordinated elements does n't  even really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the pix shows a black TV screen . I can certainly understand that too much visual stimulation around the TV screen when its turned on can be distracting . That 's my instant reaction to the Atlanta Homes Mag pic where there 's way too much going on in the room to begin with and the constantly changing TV screen would have my eyes and brain crying " aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh ! " Definitely something to keep in mind when setting thing up . <p> Since my large screen TV is in my bedroom on a media cabinet that looks like a dresser and I do n't  like the big patch of black , I got a large lightweight canvas pic that coordinates with all the other art in my room and I sit that in front of the screen during the day when the TV is not in use . <p> Ugh , what 's with all these gallery walls ? Based the sheer number of examples , I 'd say this is a trend that 's run amok and its time to move on to something new , more unique , and definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm ready to relax , so a clean , uncluttered , and zen-like atmosphere is more suitable for relaxation than one featuring cluttered walls and TV consoles . You cant hide that big black screen amongst a plethora of photos or artwork . If you cant enclose the TV in a slim cabinet or entertainment center , then how about investing in a beautiful mirrored TV ? The keep-it-simple rule truly is the golden rule when it comes to design . <p> Ours is completely unadorned . But probably because there is no room , the television takes up all of the surface area . It sits at an angle in the corner of the room next to the fireplace . The whole wall is unbalanced decor-wise , because on the other side of the fireplace , I have a tall narrow display cabinet . I considered built in cabinets and shelving above , but did n't  really want them or need them . I like to change things up , and built-in is so permanent ! <p> I 'm really liking all of these different styling options ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 'm trying to figure out how to style around our TV I 've had friends comment , " yea , I 've tried to see in your house when we drive by but all we can see is the TV " Great , haha , I need to close my curtains ! So I 'm up in the air between an eclectic gallery wall or a more uniform one ! What do you think ? We 've got a long shot-gun living room with the fireplace on the same wall as the tv Symmetric or eclectic ? ! <p> We have just wall mounted our TV and are on the lookout for an antiquey type sideboard/buffet similar to the one in the 4th picture down to go beneath it . Its amazing , now that we have taken it off a piece of furniture , how much it has already shrunk in presence in our sitting room . I cant wait to have an attractive piece of furniture under it to create a nice vignette on . 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057489 @3257489/ <h> Hanging Prepasted Wallpaper : Tips + Resources <p> By Kate Riley October 29 , 2014 <p> I adore a fabulous wallpaper , the modern prints are a fantastic way to add texture , glamour , or drama with a colorful or metallic pattern . Compared to stenciling , wallpaper is limited by its colorways and more expensive , but the look is really beautiful especially with the new contemporary metallic or intricate patterns . <p> This bathroom makeover was my second time hanging prepasted wallpaper by myself and the task is not as difficult as you might think ! With the right supplies you can hang prepasted wallpaper without professional help . The process is drippy and wet ( wear your sloppy clothes ) and it takes some time , but once you get the hang of it ( ha ! ) you 'll find it 's not as intimidating as you may think . <p> Wallpapers come in different versions : some are prepasted , some are unpasted , and some are peel off/removable . The prepasted versions work like this : once the paper is moistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to hang the paper straight , reposition if necessary , and smooth out any bubbles . <p> 1 ) Pick Your Paper . Styles and costs vary , and choosing a paper is a personal choice , but when you find one that calls your name , go for it ! <p> 2 ) Prep The Walls . Flat wallpapers with just pattern ( and not texture ) lay best on smooth walls since texture will show underneath the paper . In our bathroom , we had the walls retextured so they were perfectly smooth , but in homes where orange peel , knockdown texture , or other rough wall surfaces exist , there are two ways to get them smooth enough to install wallpaper . <p> You can retexture the walls so that they are smooth with joint compound with a few light coats ( sand in between ) and then prime them in preparation . Or you can purchase and hang prepasted lining paper underneath to prep the walls , this product is affordable and has good reviews , but there are other similar options available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper adheres well . Remove all light fixtures , electrical plates , art , shelving , or anything else that will interrupt the application of your paper . <p> 3 ) Understand the Instructions . All prepasted wallpapers come with instructions and they will guide you through the steps of hanging the paper yourself . Most of them I followed , some I tweaked , here are some techniques I found worked best . <p> No walls are ever perfectly straight but rather than hang your paper in alignment with the ( likely slightly crooked ) walls , it 's important to hang your paper so that it 's straight according to a level . Many wallpaper manufacturers recommended using a plumb line and chalk which is fine ; I thought it was far simpler to use the level and draw a long line with a pencil down the wall . For the first strip , anticipate you 'll need to align the paper to the pencil line and also allow some overlap onto an adjacent wall . <p> 4 ) Measure and Cut . A paper with a complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful measurement before cutting to match up the edges , a straight match print with a smaller repeat is more forgiving . Always allow a few extra inches at the top and bottom for trimming and perfect alignment between strips . <p> 5 ) Activate the Adhesive . There are two ways to activate the paste on the back of the paper , by soaking a paint roller with water and rolling it over the entire strip of paper , but this requires a long work surface . The alternative is to roll the paper in reverse so that the pattern is on the inside and dip it in room temperature water in a bathtub or wallpaper tray which is what I did , unrolling and rerolling with the pattern on the inside . Wait the required time recommended ( often just 3-5 minutes ) before applying the paper to the wall . <p> 6 ) Hang Slowly . You can cut ahead but only hang one piece at a time and after a few strips I found I needed to take a break . Better to do it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , double check that it is straight with the level and use the plastic tool to carefully smooth out any bubbles . Some instructions or tutorials recommend a seam roller for smoothing the seam edges when the strips are next to each other , I did n't use one , I used my index finger to align the wallpaper 's edges and followed up with the smoothing tool which worked fine to connect the edges and smooth them together . This less than $2 plastic smoothing tool I found at Lowe 's was excellent , it was soft and flexible enough to not damage the paper , but stiff enough to flatten it against the walls . <p> 7 ) Trim Carefully . Some instructions recommend using a sharp razor blade to cut the excess paper , for me it worked just fine using the plastic tool to smooth the paper into place then score the edges where they met the ceiling . While the paper was still moist I peeled it back , trimmed it with sharp scissors where I had scored it , and then smoothed it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soaked sponge to rewet the paper so you can maneuver the edges back into place . <p> Wallpapering with prepasted wallpaper is a project you do n't need to complete all at once , I did this over the course of three days , a few strips at a time and the result is so pretty ! Take a tour of the full bathroom here to see all the details and sources . <p> There are a lot of textured wallpaper patterns now available , how cool is this plank wood look pattern , it would look fab inside a bookcase or behind a bed ! <p> Get the look of classic painted white brick with white brick wallpaper ( I just bought some for a future project ! ) . <p> I have always loved grasscloth wallpaper , it is such a chic way to add texture to a space , but grasscloth is expensive . My favorite look of all is a contemporary wallpaper installed above traditional wainscoting like this , divine ! <h> 35 comments <p> I love wallpaper &amp; have been using it to decorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepasted wallpaper that had been put up in the hallway , kitchen &amp; bathrooms 18 years ago . It was very easy to remove .

Lastly I wiped the walls down . This is the only type of wallpaper I will ever use . <p> Isnt it nice how easily the modern papers come off with a soaked sponge Tricia ? I was surprised too ! I look for the word " strippable " another clue the paper will be easy to remove if you ever get tired of it . <p> I 've hung lots of prepasted wallpaper ! One tip I learned the hard way : do n't  press/roll the edges too hard , or you 'll press out all the adhesive ! Use a long carpenters level ( I use a 48 ? ) to find your plumb line . A short one is more likely to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant ever get a blade to work perfectly for me Kathy , maybe mine have not been sharp enough ? It always seems to tear the paper instead of slice clean through it when wet but as Joan pointed out , when dry a blade makes a perfect cut . I guess I 'm too impatient to wait for the strip to dry ! <p> I did have a question for you . I have a small dining room that accommodates a rectangular table that seats 6 just fine and it also has a small sideboard . I had the idea of hanging wallpaper on the main wall so the room could feel layered , but wanted to just do half the wall and do a board and batten or maybe just a chair rail below . My question is , does one wall having that kind of molding make it look un-finished or would it make sense in the room ? I feel like its too small to do the entire room since it would look too busy and its right off my living area and i want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom turned out awesome ! btw , I really love how the brick and wood patterns look so real . I 'm loving these all ! thanks for sharing . I might just give wallpapering a try after reading this ! lol <p> Hi Kate ! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bathroom wallpaper ! Yes , I have hung wall paper all of my life really . Being from back east where it is very popular , there must be 7-8 papers under the last one in our bedroom where I grew up haha . Here in Arizona , with the dry heat I had zero success with pre pasted . I switched to pasting them to the walls . ( Even if they were pre pasted ) . The past is very easy to roll on . I just put it in a paint tray and roll it on.You did n't  mention " booking " your strip before hanging . Did you skip this step ? It is where you fold the top and the bottom in onto the glued side of itself and wait a few minutes to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also on the razor thing I buy the disposable ones that have several inside and are scored to be easily " snapped off " with pliers after each cut . Stays nice and sharp . Gearing up to wallpaper the dining room , but I 'm on a spending freeze right now . LOL <p> I used to sell wallpaper until 2009 , so I have a lot of hanging experience from displays . You mentioned priming the wall ( bravo ! ) but be sure its " wallpaper primer " . It has special additives for ease of both hanging and removing . We used 4 ' levels and snap razor blades . Sometimes each cut required a new blade ! If it tears the paper , it is n't sharp enough . But thick papers , and some grasscloth can only be cut with utility knife or last resort , scissors . I 'm loving the paper you chose , and glad that people still use wallpaper ! I have always felt that you do n't  need as much wall art if there 's wallpaper in a room , it dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at a better time ! I just picked up our wall paper and was planning to start googling tips and suggestions this weekend . Thanks for saving me some time and sharing these great steps ( and with photos ! ) Much appreciated : ) <p> Thank you thank you thankyou for this wonderful paste . Herein arizona we have textured walls and the labor to wallpaper a small section was really expensive . I did n't  know that lining paper existed . Did you know you are fabulous ? <p> That fresh green is so inviting . I have a question . I want to change the kitchen wall behind my cooktop / under my hood fan . There is no backsplash as I like the counter meeting wall clean look . That said , is there a wall paper that can stand up to stove splatters and repeated washing ? .

The keys are a sharp razor and a straight edge . I will crease with my fingernail first as I line everything up and then cut it wet .

I 'm so glad that wallpaper is having a come back , nothing adds more interest to a room ! Love your blog ! ! <p> I have to agree with the poster who mentioned booking the wallpaper and letting it activate . I have also found that some prepasted need paste too . That may depend on the quality of the paper itself . Priming the walls first is essential for easy removal later .

Thanks for sharing all of those helpful little hints that make it so much easier , even for a novice paper hanger ! <p> First I love the green wallpaper you chose for the bathroom so pretty ! <p> I too find it easier to smooth out the edges of the paper with my finger rather than a tool . I did n't  see this mentioned in your post but I have found that , depending on the pattern of the wallpaper and the layout of the room/wall , that you need to keep in mind where the centre of the room is i.e. where you want to draw your eye to . I have found that a lot of wallpaper patterns look better by starting in the centre of the wall and moving outwards on either side . <p> I also love the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might try that soon . At my former home , the previous owners had red brick wallpaper ( circa 1970s ) around an old fireplace in the basement . Itlooked a bit odd when we decorated the room with light blue carpeting and pale blue walls and I did n't  know what state the wall was behind that paper so I painted the wallpaper white and individually painted each brick 2 shades of grey to mimic stone . It looked fabulous ! <p> I have worked with wallpaper for about 40 years . In the process if you do get an air bubble that you cant get out , use a small straight pin and on the color portion ( not white ) , you can make a tiny prick and work out the bubble . <p> I highly recommend that sizing be applied to the walls before any paper is applied . Eventually someone will want to remove the paper and either paint or apply new paper and the sizing makes the removal process easier and more successful . Removing wallpaper without the sizing pretreatment can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marker that matches the background to do touch up to any little places so the whitr wall does n't  show throughnot necessary when the background is white but having put up some chocolate colored paper I had a couple of tiny lines that had shrunk in when the paper dried and the seam just disappeared with a little touch up <p> Oh my goodnessI have papered a million miles and I am so glad it is " in " again . I love pretty paper . Pleased be warned to anyone paperingas will all projects , the bulk of your time seems to go into good prep work . Prepping your walls is so necessary for a beautiful finish . And sizing your walls is a must . I have also spent hours and hours removing paper that someone that put up without good prep work . It will not only will make you crazy , it will damage the wall board . Happy papering ! Julie <p> You know you 're getting old when things that went out are back in !

( Yes , it does bubble up a little when you paint it , as a commenter mentioned on the sale site , but those bubbles dissipate as they dry , and leave a smooth , clean surface ) . Definitely invest the time to " size " the walls , even after using a prime coat . This adds slippability and makes removal a breeze . You know , when you get to be 50-something and wallpaper goes out again ! <p> I so needed these tips !

New recessed lighting , a chandelier , - and pendants over the kitchen island will replace them . Adding wood beams is also- part of the plan. - Also I 'll need a chandelier to drop down over the dining table . That said , it brought to my attention the topic of mixing light fixtures in shared kitchen and dining spaces like this one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in stone by any means , but I do know this , the one no fail way to mix light fixtures in close spaces like the kitchen and dining room combo above is to match the finish of the fixtures but vary the shape . <p> In this recent kitchen remodel I combined pale wood finishes in different shapes for the pendants and chandelier because they were close to each other in one connected space . Varying the shapes keeps it interesting , matching the finishes keeps it clean . Here are three examples of the same concept , in styles from transitional to contemporary . <p> I do n't subscribe to the notion that the finishes on light fixtures in adjacent spaces should always match , there are no rules other than fixtures close together should complement each other , but it is a great designer trick for making sure fixtures that are relatively close together look cohesive and at the same time it keeps the lighting interesting . <p> If you want to use color or texture ( woven , shell , etc. ) you can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do it . In this cottage kitchen the homeowner mixed a large scale textural basket weave pendant with porcelain enamel pendants. - The same is happening in- the traditional kitchen and dining space below , the finishes on the fixtures are different but the styles are complementary . <p> Speaking of great lighting , I also rounded up some favorite floor lamps over at Lamps Plus today with ideas on where to use them . Ill be updating you on the renovation as it happens , much more to come ! <p> I NEEDED this post ! I 'm currently working out a plan for my kitchen/dining space and I 've been completely LOST trying to pick out island pendants and a chandelier that go together without being matchy matchy or totally mismatched . <p> This is a subject Ive been thinking about lately . I 'm working on lighting for our cabin LR , dining area and kitchen ; all one room . I 'm thinking of using the same fixtures for the dining area and LR , but I 'm not sure if it would look ok to hang them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very hard time finding inspiration pictures for a cabin . It seems everything is either over-the-top ornate , or very rustic . <p> Yes you can hang them at different levels , chandeliers over dining tables can hang lower than pendants , as low as 28 ? above the table . Pendants should n't obstruct the view between the kitchen and dining . I 'd consider oil rubbed bronze finishes in transitional styles for your cabin feel free to send me some pictures ! 23102 @qwx883102

Meanwhile I was looking for something vibrant and colorful , I thought of just buying another rug but instead opted to sew a fabric floor mat with some outdoor fabric I spied on sale at Joann Fabrics . <p> I used a yoga mat as an insert to make the floor mat thicker and softer underfoot and I love the fun palm print with a tropical vibe , its a much welcome color injection in my kitchen in my favorite shades of blue and green . <p> - <p> - <p> To make a fabric floor mat , all you need is 1 -+ to 2 yards of canvas or outdoor fabric ( the length depends on if you want a runner size or something smaller ) , thread , and an inexpensive thin yoga mat to fit inside . <p> I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also find them at sporting goods stores , or sometimes Walmart or Target or online at Amazon . The fabric I chose is a stain and water resistant outdoor fabric in a fun palm print . ( It 's a new Richloom Solarium print but I ca n't find it on the Solarium website so I do n't know the name . ) <p> - <p> The process for making the floor mat is the same as sewing these easy envelope pillow covers you create it with one long strip of fabric , you 're basically sewing one big envelope to cover the yoga mat . Trim your yoga mat to the size you want your floor mat to be , leave it long for a runner size or trim it shorter like I did to make it smaller . <p> - <p> With a sewing machine , fold over and hem the edges of the long side that will wrap around the mat and form the envelope opening : the A side of the fabric . <p> - <p> - <p> Next , flip the fabric inside out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - <p> Lay the yoga mat insert on top of the inside out envelope to make sure the width and length of the mat will fit inside the floor mat . <p> - <p> Pin the overlapping A sides together ( inside out ) , this is where you will sew the B sides together to create the envelope . <p> - <p> Once you 've sewn both the B sides together , flip it right side out and insert the yoga mat like you 'd fill a duvet cover , tucking the corners of the yoga mat into the fabric envelope . <p> - <p> I used a safety pin to keep the flap closed so it does n't move out of place on the floor . <p> - <p> To avoid slippage , add a piece of masking tape to each corner underneath to hold it in place in front of the sink . <p> - <p> The yoga mat insert softens the mat for those hours spent standing on it , and the tape helps keep the fabric mat in place . <p> - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when soiled after a few weeks simply toss the fabric cover into the washing machine- on a gentle cycle then put it back in place ! <p> Choose any fabric you like to make your own floor mat , I recommend washable canvas or outdoor fabrics that are moisture , stain , and fade resistant . <p> Weird . My yoga mat already matches my kitchen accents . Think I have a signature colour ? LOL Steel Magnolias reference . Instead of covering it , I think this girl is going to stencil that baby and then it is a for sure no-skid option : ) Youre genius ! <p> That 's really cute ! I wonder , have you ever tried to use lines of hot glue or caulk on the back for non-skid help ? I 've heard of this idea , but never tried it for fear of harming the flooring . You just put lines across with it and let it dry before using . <p> Great idea . I was thinking that the yoga mat could also be cut and used as a rug pad to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that different from the rug pad that I have underneath my kitchen rug . The only real difference is the thickness and I 'm thinking it might actually make a better rug pad because of the extra cushioning it provides . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057498 @3257498/ <h> Advice for Couples : Mixing Styles <p> By Kate Riley May 20 , 2015 <p> Today , I thought I 'd address a common question , how do couples with different styles and separate possessions who get married or decide to live together create a cohesive home that they both can enjoy ? I know many couples where the husband has no input because either he does n't  care or his wife does n't  care to ask . I know a few couples who shop for absolutely everything together , and I know many couples who fall somewhere in between . <p> I received this email from newlywed Carrie in Indiana which prompted the topic : <p> " Hi Kate ! We have recently bought our first place ( yay ! ) and weve only lived together since November , so I feel that there is a mish-mash of styles at our current place . What 's your best advice for combining styles or decorating a new home ? Neither of us have owned before , so its all new territory . <p> With our new house , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leave the garage alone , and that 's ok with me ! ) but I feel guilty either not getting his input , or wanting to get rid of something that 's his . <p> The tufted sofa is mine , the dressers are hisThe white end tables are hand me downs from my great-grandma . I love a lot of mid century modern style . I think he s used to having the matching " bedroom suite " and I 'm just not that way . I do n't  know where to start , its a big projectdecorating a house , if we 've never had a house before to furnish . " <p> Great question Carrie , all newly cohabitating couples have been there . I had think back to the beginning when I was first married and what we did to make it work . I remember he had all of his stuff , I had mine , and when we brought it all together at first it was completely hodge podge and none of it worked together . It took many years to create a home with cohesive pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . <p> here 's a little of our story . In the beginning when Matt came home to find me in my decorating mode tearing out pages from a catalog or with a paintbrush in hand , he got very scared . However years later if he is witnessing the same thing , he does n't  panic because he trusts me . I have made design mistakes along the way , ones he does n't  hold against me or bring up ( good man ! ) and that 's part of the journey , but we agree on a classic yet casual style having lived together for so long . <p> In our master bedroom , he was the one who bought our dresser and highboy from an antique store ten years ago , but they 're a bit traditional for me . I think its really important to pick your battles so rather than fight to replace them , I picked out the club chairs , nightstands , and bedding and in that space we compromised . When we bought our dining room table , we agreed on the style we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final candidates before we made the big purchase . <p> In the family room , we picked out our first set of sofas fifteen years ago , ones he loved far more than me ( they were forest green ) ; the second set of blue/gray slipcovered sofas purchased were completely my decision and he s never liked them as much as I have , so the third times a charm as they say , and this summer were choosing a sectional for the family room and will make the decision together . <p> With the major remodeling projects , I will do most of the research , narrow choices down to a few selections , then ask his input especially on the big investments and ones that affect value like flooring and countertops . He s a real estate appraiser so not only does he get it , he enjoys being involved in those decisions . That method works best for us but it has taken many years to get there . <p> When it comes to decorating , he defers to me on the little things from fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment pieces and many of the paint colors after I 've narrowed down a few samples . He does n't  question me when I feel like swapping out the decor or repainting something but we also have an agreement to consult each other on anything that costs more than a certain amount . Several of Matts familys heirlooms are on display in our home because that 's important to him . <p> My best advice for you Carrie is to take it slow , there 's no rush . Decide which rooms you want to furnish first , ideally the shared spaces like the family room and/or master bedroom are good places to start . If he completely defers to you you 're lucky but do n't  ignore his tastes , especially in places where he will spend a lot of time . Furniture like your bed , sofa , dressers , and nightstands will last you for many years , so either keep his dressers and your sofa and make them work for you or invest in pieces down the road that you 'll both love . If you do that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics , wood trim , especially since you love mid century modern style ) so that you can add more shapely feminine accents over the years should you choose do so . <p> I asked a few of my fellow designer and blogger friends for tips on how they achieved the same goal , how do husbands , wives , and partners decorate a home together over time so that each ones tastes are satisfied . Heres what they had to say : <p> " Listen to his input . My husband trusts my decorating decisions because he knows that I wont go in a direction he hates . If you decide to pick out things together , make sure it includes elements that you both love ! " Chris , Just A Girl <p> " Go ahead and pick your paint colors but let him have a vote before you begin painting .

To make matters worse I am working with a home I moved into after my husbands wife of thirty years passed away . We have been married 4 years and the house still remains the same as the way she decorated it . Same furniture , same colors . It is not my style at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a big mistake ) so nothing is my style and he does n't  want to change a thing . I am really struggling to fit in here ! Any suggestions for this problem would be appreciated . <p> Oh man , I 've had to deal with this throughout my marriage . Were now in a good place , where I 'm the one in charge of making things pretty , and he s the one who actually makes them work from a structural standpoint . It seems to be working for us ! <p> Oh boy , I SO wish my hubs did n't  care ! We have been married almost 40 years , and he still wants to dictate what we do in decor . Overall , we compromise , but many times I would have gone in a different direction . We have mostly classic furniture in masculine fabrics . But I brought in my style with decorative items . Paint colors are earthy and light in the common areas , but the master is a sea green , with the bath in a coordinating color called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bargain custom drapes in those shades with a bit of tan and cream in them . I got them from my job , rejects from a customer , for $50 ! !

Weve been in this house 7 years now with the same things , and I 'm ready to start over with new flooring and redoing the kitchen and master bath ! Got to get rid of the builder grade stuff ! ; - ) <p> There are a lot of decorating decisions my husband does n't  care about , but since his opinions are so random to me I tend to run all major changes past him . Sometimes hell ask me why I 'm asking him , but my answer is " you might care , and if you do I want to know ! " But overall he trusts me and my design instincts , and I do my best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house as well as my own . <p> Great article , Kate . I have a question off topic . I have almost the same fireplace and recently painted my walls light gray . I want to change the tan tile surrounding the fireplace and was thinking black tile . I think black tile would add drama in a good way . But , I do n't  like the idea of black tile on the floor in front of the fireplace as it would show dust and cat hair . Any suggestions ? <p> Oh man , this has been on my mind so much lately ! My situation is really tough too since my husband bought the house we live in several years before we even met , so he bought furniture and did some decorating according to his tastes . Thankfully it has n't  caused much conflict , but it still makes me feel a little bad to rearrange anything or put something up when I know its my style , and not his . Marriage is all about compromise though , right ? And even though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I kind of like seeing our tastes mesh ( or clash haha ) . <p> The posters two dresser do n't  necessarily need to go in the BR . One could make a lovely chest in a LR or DR . I would look great painted in a livelier colour with a faux bamboo styling or even a burnt bamboo finish . these are perfect pieces for that treatment and can co either mid-century or more earthy . <p> Kate , You sound like me ! I am happy to say that my husband now has faith in my design abilities to allow me to make design decisions in our home . I do like to include him , though , and will run paint samples by him but instead of overwhelming him with the 15 different gray samples I was pondering over , I will just show him two or possibly three . Sometimes I do make purchases of paint and decor items without fully involving him . However , he knows how thrifty I am with my purchases ( yard sales and Goodwill for me ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nearly all of the painting since we moved into our house a few months ago , so he has decided to not say too much ; ) I do admit that my husband and I have similar tastes in style . We prefer a transitional look and appreciate similar colors . Right now I am in the midst of selecting windows for our house . Its been exciting for me to research windows , and meet with contractors then report back to my husband . It is a huge , and expensive , decision , though , and in this case I do wish my husband was more involved ! <p> There are several couples I know for whom this is a huge issue . And nothing much happens as far as decorating is concerned , because they can not meet in the middle . I consider myself lucky , because my husband will go with pretty much all of my decorating decisions . Like some of the other ladies above , I will run paint colors , fabrics etc. by him and for the most part he agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same colors and my style is more practical and sensible . He would likely balk at frilly and flowery , but then again , so would I ! Pretty much anything that is bought that runs more than $ 100 is discussed beforehand , because we are both frugal . Its worked for us for 27 years : ) <p> Most of the time my husband is on board with what I 'd like to do , but sometimes he fights really hard for little thingsthings like a giant poster of a shark with its mouth open . He compromised by putting it behind his closet door ( I think he realizes that its ridiculous ) now he laughs every time he gets ready in the morning ( and so do I when I put away his clothes ) . We always discuss major purchases to find something that works for both of us . He was dead set on a wood bed when we were looking for new bedroom furniture , but I was thinking about an upholstered one . We ended up agreeing to spend a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with ! <p> Great post and great advise to take it slow , and respect each others taste . Marriage or cohabitation is all about compromise and if not , there are bigger , underlying issues that you should take heed to . I once moved into my husbands place , and I never felt comfortable decorating it and always felt like I was living in someone elses house , as we had opposite styles . <p> Sometimes when you do n't  see eye to eye its an opportunity to be even more creative and come up with a solution that is even better than the original two differing ideas . I think in business they call it synergy . I just wrote a post on how to create a stylish man cave and boy did it give my husband and I practice in this area ! : - ) <p> If my husband and I werent married , my house would probably look like an English country cottage , and his would look like the bridge of the Enterprise in Star Trek . So we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my husband has decided I 'm in charge of esthetics and he s in charge of function . We each concentrate on the area we care about and he feels like he s an equal partner . We each have " veto power " on the rare occasions we have opinions in the other persons area . This has meant I 've had to give up built-ins for electronics or a wall tv over the fireplace , because " not enough air circulation , too much heat " . Also had to give up the lighting fixture I wanted because he did n't  like the way we would have had to drill through beams to run the wiring . On the other hand , I chose a bathroom floor tile he thought was ugly and I told him " If you do n't  like it , it will bug you for the two days you 're looking at it while you install it , and then you 'll never think about it again . If I do n't  like it , it will bug me every single day for as long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint . I try to choose neutral colors and heavier pieces that do n't  feel overly feminine , and the half dozen large oil paintings painted by his grandmother from the 50s that he WOULD NOT let go ofwell , I never thought I 'd say it , but over the years theyve actually grown on me . So its all good ! <p> Surprisingly , when I moved into my now husbands house everything we had went together . We just had too much of everything , moving a fully furnished 3 bedroom house into a fully furnished 4 bedroom house . So we gave away a lot of my stuff that I was n't committed to . And made his previous wife take as much stuff as possible ! We kept the things I really cared about . I mostly leave decorating decisions up to my husband since he s the artistic one but I do a lot of research and make sure he knows my preferences . <p> I just started using Olioboard to creat mood/inspiration boards for how I want to decorate our new house . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about what elements he likes , does n't  like , etc and swap out different options . You can even take pictures of your own furniture and import them into the tool .

We chose a butcher block countertop , routed the edge , stained it dark , then used Waterlox to protect it . Two and a half years later , I 'm happy to report our wood bathroom countertops have held up extremely well , there is no water damage and they still clean up very easily . <p> We also have a wood countertop in our kitchen and while it 's a higher maintenance surface ( you ca n't place anything hot on it or leave puddles of water for long periods of time ) it also still looks beautiful 8 years after installation .

Thanks ! ! ! <p> Marble is the absolute favorite countertop material , but not only does it cost way more than people want to spend on their hallway bathroom , but even if it was in the budget I think I would have a heck of a time finding a marble that would look good with the marble-ish floor tile I chose . <p> Thank you for the inspiration , Kate !

I also have a concern about " wood overload " as well as choosing a stain color for the countertop .

Any advice on what color stain to go with ? <p> I love the look of wood . We are currently planning our kitchen . I would love wooden counter tops but have been worried that they wont hold up . Good to hear 8 years and you are still going strong . The bathroom is gorgeous too . <p> I have had a heart pine countertop in my upstairs hall bath for 16 years . It has four coats of polyurethane on it . There is one bad spot near the sink that I repair with an almond stick when it needs it . It has held up beautifully . It is much more traditional than those pictured here , but very beautiful . The bottom of the vanity is painted blue . I have two kohler sinks and behind the wooden backsplash , I put in painted tongue and groove . Then I found two heavy pine mirrors to hang on the painted wooden wall . <p> The wood countertop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous . It stuck in my mind . Last year I decided to upgrade my 25-year-old bathroom . The white custom-made cabinets were still in very good shape . So I removed the countertop and boring sinks and faucets . I bought a butcherblock top from Sears that is typically used for a workbench . It is a gorgeous piece of wood and its unbelievable that it only cost $100 ! I followed your steps for sanding , staining , and sealing with waterlox . It turned out beautiful ! I paired that with a large rectangular porcelain sink with elliptical sides and a brushed chrome stem faucet . They were sold together on Amazon for around $120 . I am thrilled with the results ! It is my very first DIY project and I owe it all to you ! Thank you Kate ! <p> Another gorgeous option for a wet space like a bathroom would be teakits typically used on boats , so it holds up to water .

But I have to say some of the countertops here presented are really wonderful . With good maintenance is a nice option . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Oh man , we just re-did our wooden kitchen sink surround , which died a horrible , grisly , rotten death after only 7 years ( the previous owner had installed it and if they treated it at all , I do n't  know what with ) . We treated the new countertop with teak oil , but it is already showing signs of water damage ( around the faucet base ) after only a month . I wish we could have afforded marble , granite or even stainless , but basic butcher block was the only thing in our budget . These examples are very beautiful , but have probably benefited from professional attention . If you are considering wood in the kitchen or bath , proceed with EXTREME caution . 23102 @qwx883102

Check out those old blinds and balloon valances too , aw yeah . <p> The entrance is so much better with no doors and natural light ! <p> I replaced the medicine cabinet on the right with a simple beveled edge version and removed the medicine cabinet on the left by filling in the gap with framing and drywall to allow for a ring towel holder . I also repainted the vanity a different color , this is Silver Marlin by Benjamin Moore , it has a green undertone to complement the tile , better than the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . <p> But back to the tile . It comes in boxes and I shopped for it at Floor and Decor . This is the diamond pattern Carrara White Caribbean Green Mosaic , I spied it online and went into their store to check it out in person and was Insta smitten , the diamonds are grey and white and the diagonal pieces are all shades of green , some light some dark , the variegated tones makes it more interesting up close . <p> I had never been to a Floor &amp; Decor store before , I was impressed with the selection , prices , and the quantities ! The stores are HUGE , 60,000-80,000 square feet and each store stocks thousands of tile , stone , and wood products , ready to take with you for your project because they keep hundreds of square feet in stock . They carry tile , wood , laminate , and vinyl plank flooring , countertops ( butcher block and granite ) , and supplies for installation of all these surfaces . <p> The manager Bill gave me a tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned they source directly from manufacturers around the globe to guarantee the lowest prices . I had great customer service , Floor &amp; Decor also has a design center with on site inspiration offering free design services to help you pull a look together . <p> For the design of this space I chose overhead vanity lights instead of sconces . I love a sconce/mirror combo with a single sink but for this double sink there was n't quite enough space on the sides of the mirrors , so I chose vanity bath lights . Also since the ceiling height is eight feet , the vanity lights above elongate the space and draw the eyes up as does the diamond tile installed in the vertical direction . <p> The countertops are Caesarstone , I 'll have more to share on this quartz surface after the kitchen remodel reveal since we installed the same surface in there . I also opted for chrome faucets and oval mirrors below the nickel vanity lights see sources below . <p> Installing a mosaic tile backsplash is n't difficult , Ive done it myself in bathrooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project I hired a helper because I did n't  have a tile saw in Las Vegas among my tools . You can rent them of course but instead I enlisted the help of the same subcontractor who helped us install the tile floors to bring over his tile saw and help install the tile on the wall . <p> The process is simple , there are so many tutorials online , but here are the basics : prep the wall and make sure it can support your tile , repair any damage necessary . We had removed the large mirror and needed to patch the wall in a few places where the previous glass adhesive had torn away bits of the drywall . We also had to move the electrical wires over 5 inches so that the overhead vanity lights would be centered over the faucets ( move electrical wires with caution and make sure to turn off power ! hire an electrician if necessary ! ) <p> Apply a thinset mortar or tile adhesive with a trowel , use a level to ensure the tile is even . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , top , and bottom cuts , also if you 're working around light switches . If you 're inexperienced definitely hire a professional but you can also rent a tile saw and do it yourself . <p> There were a few sheets of tile that had really dark green diagonal pieces which I did n't  care for so I removed them and substituted lighter pieces with a box cutter blade . <p> Allow the tile to set for a day then apply the grout with a grout float , wipe it down with a sponge , you can buy premixed or dry grout and mix it up yourself . <p> I couldnt be happier with this tile ! It did require some tweaks to get this it just right , selecting the individual sheets in the store and removing a few of the dark pieces , but wow , I think its absolutely stunning , I wish you could see it in person and touch it too . <p> *This tile project and post is sponsored by Floor &amp; Decor , the tile for this project was complimentary and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It took me a few looks to understand the door switchingand then , it was SO obviously the thing to do ! Lovely transformationyou make it sound so easy ! Its a gift . Every little decision paralyzes mewhich is why my baths are stuck in the 70s.one with ripped off wallpaper , never painted or replaced ; / <p> Absolutely beautiful and brilliant , Kelly . My 1980s vanity area off the master is this same size ceiling height currently with old oak vanity sink area and drop-down makeup area , ugly and impractical . Your bath redo goes to the top in my inspiration file . Very nice recognition at Maria Killams Facebook ! <p> So gorgeous , Kate ! I love all of this and the tile is such a statement , but my favorite part is how you reworked the existing cabinets into something that looks so much more custom and high end . I 'm glad you did n't  try to repurpose the saloon doors though . ; ) <p> Kate , its gorgeous ! Quick question how do you paint the cabinets ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ask because I 've repainted a cabinet by hand but it took a lot of work to ensure I eliminated brush strokes and sanded between coats , etc . Any tips on simplifying the process while getting a beautiful finish ? <p> What topcoat do you use ? <p> Sorry for the questions but your work is stunning and I would love to replicate it just a bit ! <p> Love the tile . I pickedthe same thing for an accent , approx 2x3 ' , rectangle behind my cooktop . Except , mine has green diamonds , and white diagonals . The tiny connecting diamonds , and the 1 ? half round " framing " around it are golden onyx which pick up the color of the natural maple cabinets . It was a splurge but definitely worth it . Ill have to see if there 's a Floor &amp; Decor anywhere around me . <p> I started my master bath around the same time as you and could n't wait to see what you were going to do . It looks fabulous ! Since mine was not a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be completed within a month . When it ended up taking over 5 months , I thought there was something wrong with me for sure and at times felt overwhelmed .

How do you think it would work on a floor or shower wall ( perhaps as accent ) ? Or will I hate keeping all that grout clean ? Nearest Floor and Decor is about 100 miles away but sounds worth the drive since I can hit Ikea and Ballard Designs outlet as well . <p> HI , I 've been following you for the last two years and I am so impressed with your work .

You have such a flair for envisioning and pulling awesome components together into one , magical beauty . LOVE ! ! <p> I had noticed the back of my own bathroom cabinet doors having the same contemporary shaker style , but I cant switch mine unless I heavily fill &amp; paint ( wanted to gel stain ) , because they have those HUGE , recessed hidden hinges . But in the thinking , I realizedthe faux drawer fronts also can be reversed ! They do n't  have shaker trim on the other side , like the doors , but neither do they have that telltale tapered edge of the 90s cabinets . I know that wo n't help for real drawer fronts , but my powder room only has faux drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped in , &amp; easy to reverse . To " contemporarize " real drawer fronts &amp; even doors , I 've been toying with the idea of laying a flat , shaker-style frame ( diy ) over the existing one , then using wood filler on the little gap at the outside ( again , possibly necessitating paint , but at least no huge hinges to deal with detaching &amp; reattaching ) . Then in the inner part of the frame , just glue in a tiny concave quarter-round or other petite trim . 23102 @qwx883102

Meanwhile let 's continue the topic of bathroom renovation from yesterdays post on five ways to update a bathroom with four additional ways to make improvements . <p> Update the Lighting . Modern vanity lights are far more attractive than the dated marquee vanity fixtures leftover from the 1980s . Another stylish upgrade is to swap the overhead vanity light for two sconces that flank the mirror , a change we made in our hall bathroom . We paid an electrician to do the job and the result was so worth it ! <p> Chandeliers or statement light fixtures also add personality to a bathroom space , remove the boring overhead " boob " light and upgrade with something unique or glamorous , one you 'll appreciate every time you enter the space ! <p> Replace the Vessels ( Sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty , one that may require a new countertop or vanity to go with it if you replace an older overmount , but the look is one that 's desirable to many homeowners for its contemporary appeal . <p> Cover Those Walls . Board and batten , tongue &amp; groove planks , and wallpaper all upgrade a bathroom space in a dramatic way . Since the bathroom is a room that is smaller in square footage compared to the rest of the house , you can have some fun and make a major style statement while you 're at it ! Bold or soothing , its your call . <p> Soften with Textiles . The multiple tile and stone surfaces in a bathroom make it a moisture friendly space but from a design perspective can leave it feeling cold soften it with textiles beyond the obvious plush set of towels . A pretty roman shade or patterned shower curtain are both opportunities to add color and pattern . <p> What a great article Kate ! I painted stripes on our master bath wall on a whim one night while my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves it , but I 'm sort of growing tired of it and am itching to do something different . Our house is a new build so sometimes its hard to pull out a perfectly good brand new faucet and replace it , or light fixture , or shower enclosure . This has given me the inspiration to look at my bath in a new way to see where I can add character rather than reno a brand new bath . Thanks ! <p> Love all the bathrooms . However I m looking for ideas for our powder room which is really small-about 3+8 ! Right now I have a pedestal sink and am a bit tired of it and would like more storage . Have ben looking for vanities that go the full width 36 inches but the problem is the vanity tops they come with are 37 inches . Any ideas with a reasonable price range ? Also need ideas for sconces and mirrors . 23102 @qwx883102

The use of brass hardware in kitchens is on the rise and to be expected since we 've all been giddy for gold in the past few years . <p> For the kitchen remodel I 'm featuring next week I chose polished chrome hardware ( these gorgeous knobs and these beautiful pulls ) and they are so yummy . However , I 'm just as crazy about the brass hardware that 's popping up in many a magazine and blogger kitchen remodel , the golden tones of brass against cooler hues in painted gray , green , or blue cabinets is a beautiful medley and of course white and gold is a timeless combination . <p> Like anything that comes full circle in design , the look of brass hardware again has modern appeal . The house I grew up in in the 80s had all lacquered brass faucets , fixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn off to me for years . Yet the newer looks in brass kitchen hardware feel very fresh with their clean lines and matte satin finish . Are you a fan ? <h> 23 comments <p> i 'm way into this . just got a brass based mcm lamp from a thrift store that has instantly hiptified my family room . force me to pick two favorite kitchen pics here ? okay : k. marshall , emily henderson . thanks for sharing ! what beauty ! <p> I agree with you about the 80s brass making you feel very anti-brass for a long time . I could n't wear any yellow metal jewelry until a few years agoeverything had to be silver . While I like seeing brass now and I like seeing it mixed into kitchens , I still cant see it being on everything in a kitchen . Brass pulls/knobs are beautiful , but I think I draw my line at the brass faucet . Maybe if it were an aged brass ? Maybe ? Favorite two : Emily Henderson and Sarah Richardson . <p> I 'm sure its my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of brass as being so old lady . When I think of all the solid brass things I have given away . I still prefer brushed nickel but this is a beautiful kitchenwho knows maybe you can teach this old dog some new tricks ! <p> I love the antiqued brass hardware , but am hesitant to go " all in " in the fixtures too I guess that bad 80s brass is hard to shake off ! The kitchens you featured are gorgeous though I especially love the brass against the rich blue cabinets ! <p> I 'm redoing our kitchen with super dark blue base cabinets ( which , by the way , is not a colour its possible to get with any sheen , I 'm having to paint and then varnish them ) . <p> I love certain gold/brass hardware and tried to buy some , but there are two problems when it comes down to brass tacks ( see what I did there ? ) . The actual finish varies so so much that you ca n't mix and match , and they are outrageously expensive compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiness of the finish and the price . I liked one cup pull that was $30 each , and of course nothing else in their range ( and specfic finish ) was right for the upper cabinets . <p> I ended up going with polished nickel and matched a Home Depot special order cup pull with an off the shelf knob . <p> I have always loved brass but not the yellowish lacquered stuff from the 80s . When we built our retirement home I struggled to find authentic brass hardware and fixtures , resorting to eBay and websites . My builder tried to talk me out of brass , insisting it was too dated for an upscale project . Thank goodness for Baldwin Brass ! I did have to use mixed metals in the kitchen and baths . Moen made chrome and brass faucets and towel bars , now discontinued , but beautiful in our home . So glad you can find brass easier now . <p> Not a fan of the brass . While the kitchens above are lovely , the brass looks either dated or trendy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my kitchen and bathroom cabinets painted white as the 1980s-built homes in my HOA all have those great dark-framed windows with sliders or mullions which I love and which ( with an arch and a vaulted ceiling in the LR ) help give my little place a slightly Spanish bungalow feel . In the end , however , it might be too much and I 'll probably stick with chrome or nickel . <p> I 've always loved brass and never understood why everyone was painting it a few years ago . I think the problem with much of the brass from the 80s was that it is cheaply made . We have high quality brass door handles and hinges on our french doors that were expensive and beautifully made and they are classic . Cheap anything is just that and no matter what the material it will never stand the test of time . <p> Love the brass/gold in these kitchens , but its just a trend . If you do n't  mind switching out your handles , faucet and lighting in a few years then go for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like the brass hardware on the navy blue and black cabinets in your photos , but the light-colored cabinetsespecially the gray onesnot so much ! But like you I remember the brass hardware from the 80s and it feels old to me . <p> Really amazing how the brass adds such a wow factor but subtle at the same time . Also surprising how neutral the brass looks it pretty much goes with most color combinations . The brass adds a really nice finish . 23102 @qwx883102

It was just big enough to carry my phone , a little makeup and sunscreen , my water bottle , and it had a little extra room in case I picked up a souvenir during the day .

@@99057529 @3257529/ <h> Brass Hardware : Polishing and Faking It <p> By Kate Riley February 5 , 2012 <p> One thing is undeniable in the DIY and design world , brass hardware is back and lately I 'm totally loving it on furniture . As a child of the 80 's I admit shiny lacquered brass fixtures still do n't appeal to me , but I am drawn to the golden glow of real or antiqued brass with its warmer patina . <p> In the past two weeks , I 've fixed up two pieces , one dresser and one campaign desk , and both had brass hardware I wanted to reuse. - One set of hardware was real brass , the other brass plate , and both needed a good polish . <p> Over the last year , I 've also narrowed down two great substitutes for faking the patina with other hardware that you want to give a golden glow. - If you 're curious how to tell the difference between real brass and brass plate , how to polish unlacquered brass , or how to fake the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Real brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and if it 's not lacquered , will tarnish with exposure to air over time. - There are two methods I use to bring back the mellow antiqued patina , one is Brasso if I have it on hand and the other is natural lemon juice and salt paste mixture . <p> But first , before you polish , you should know whether your hardware is real brass or brass plate. - Here 's the simple way to tell the difference. - Take a household magnet and see if it will stick to the piece , if it wo n't that means the hardware is real brass , like these campaign pulls . <p> However , if the magnet picks up the hardware , then it 's brass plated ( with steel or iron as its base ) . <p> Good old fashioned Brasso works well for cleaning off the tarnish , and I usually soak for about 20 to 30 minutes . <p> With real brass , I use a rag or extra fine steel wool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of salt and lemon juice as a natural polish , use approximately -+ cup of salt per squeeze of -+ lemon to make a paste . <p> Either one works great on either brass plate or real brass , just be sure to use a soft rag or soft toothbrush with brass plate and not steel wool , it can scratch the thin brass plating . <p> Lemon juice is acidic , so be sure to fully rinse and buff your brass hardware , and I 've read that using a little olive oil on top will prolong the periods between polishing . <p> I find brass plated hardware is more stubborn for some reason and usually takes repeat soaks to bring it back to life but it can be done . <p> But if your brass plate does n't come back to life because it 's too corroded or you want to give it the patina of unlacquered brass , there are two products that will do just that . <p> Rub N ' Buff is a waxy metallic finish that comes in several golden shades such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antique Gold and European Gold. - Krylon 's Gold Leaf ' is the best metallic gold spray paint I 've found to date to mimic brass or give you a warm golden glow on your hardware . <p> As you can see , both the Rub n ' Buff and Gold Leaf spray paint are pretty darn close to the real thing ! <p> What about you ? - Have you noticed the popularity of brass hardware on furniture lately ? - Are you liking its resurgence ? - Know any other natural formulas or products that are great for cleaning brass ? - Do share ! <h> 68 comments <p> Great post ! When restoring my old house , I learned an easy way to clean old metal that has been painted over ( like door hinges , knobs , escutcheons , etc . ) . Get an old crock pot ( one you WILL NOT use for food ever again ) and put the metal items in it . Add a little bit of dish soap then fill with water . Turn crock pot on low setting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will peel right off !

Thanks , Kate ! : ) <p> I have an old sewing machine table I painted and was looking for a new handle on the front . I painted the table an off white and now that I see how easy brass is to clean , I think I 'll give this a try and see how I like it . Luckily we are not short on magnets around here , so I 'll be able to do the test very soon . : ) Here is the link to the sewing table I gave a face lift too : LONG ... <p> This post is so timely for me ! !

For those who like oil rubbed bronzerusteolum has an oil rubbed bronze spray paintit looks totally awesome .. However , thanks for the update and guidance on brass .. Nancy <p> My living room is pretty much Brasstown , USA , so I guess you can say I love brass despite being a child of the 80s . : ) I have a pair of brass candlesticks that are ruinednothing takes the tarnish off .

SO excited . Thank you ! <p> The quickest and least expensive way to clean heavily tarnished brass is to soak it in ammonia for 15-30 minutes in a nonreactive container ( glass or plastic if you use plastic , use something that you 're not going to eat out of ) . Make sure that you do this in a WELL VENTILATED area ( ammonia is very strong ) . Put on a pair of rubber gloves to remove the item(s) and scrub with 0000 steel wool as you rinse it under the tap . This will remove the tarnish effortlessly , without using a lot of elbow grease . Dry and then shine it up with your favorite metal polish . <p> I love antique rass hardware when used on a great piece of furniture as an accent .

If that does n't  bother you than go for it , but that 's why rub n buff is an alternative option for those hinged pieces , try it ! Kate <p> Thank you for sharing the tips ! I did n't  know about the magnet trick . I 'm not sure about brass . It does remind me of the 80s , but I bet it ca n't be that bad when you pair it with an updated piece of furniture <p> Thanks for sharing the cleaning tips . Personally , I am conflicted on the brass revival . My mum LOVES brass in all its forms -bright and shiny to antiqued and darkened so after growing up in a house with so many brass accents , I use brass very sparingly in our home since I do love mixing my metals . <p> I just refinished two campaign dressers in BM Wolf Gray and used Rub n Buff on the pulls . Unfortunately after several soaks with Brasso I realized they were too far gone , after 30+ years of tarnish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patinaed brass look is fabulous and I 'm glad its making a come back ! But the shiny brass of the 90s can stay away ! <p> Ah , yes . That funhouse mirror shiny , lacquered brass plated steel abounds in thrift stores and leafy post-war suburbia . Chandeliers , doorknobs , cabinet knobs , even fireplace screens were lousy with the stuff when I bought my own slice of suburbia in 1985 . I am still still ! spray painting ORB on old doorknobs ( when Mr. " What 's Wrong With Our Doorknobs ? " is away on the golf course wearing white shoes and green plaid trousers , which kinda disqualify him from giving style advice , dontchathink ? ) Keep fighting the good fight , Kate . We are allies in this war on " Eighties Style " ( an oxymoron if ever there was one . <p> This made me smile , especially since I have taken over two decades to rid my house of that nasty brass ! ; - ) I wrote a post about Brass is Back and 1980s retro decorating . : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Is it appropriate to polish brass pulls on a mid century credenza that is worth alot of money ? Do the pulls have to be removed or could you tape off the borders and polish while still on ? Thanks for all of the good advice . ( This piece also has brass hindges ) <p> Thanks for this post ! I am in the process of planning the makeover of my husbands dresser , and this is just what I needed to read . And I LOVE that you included a realistic-looking alternative to brass in spray paint form . You rock ! <p> TO KEEP METALS TARNISH FREE : Check the website **27;44;TOOLONG for full instructions on cleaning metals and treating with a tarnish barrier . My many , many pieces of heirloom silver , brass and copper have been cleaned and treated using this simple process and they remain tarnish free after several years . I have found the Maas Metal Cleaner puts a super shine on metals that no other metal cleaner has produced . I use ProtectaClear spray and cant say enough good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve yourself of frequent , tedious metal cleaning . <p> Although the current trend is displaying heavily tarnished silver pieces , be aware that heavy tarnish will eventually pit silver . <p> I use my forty-year old copper pots and pans daily . To remove the tarnish , which is almost constant in my high-humidity area , I simply use a paste of table salt and cheap red wine vinegar . No rubbing or scrubbing needed . It does n't  produce a perfect result but does make the pots presentable and salt and red wine vinegar are always close at hand in the kitchen . <p> I am using both my grandmothers sterling silver flatware daily . They stored it away for " someday " and its time someone enjoyed it , so I am . To keep it relatively tarnish-free , I purchased some silver cloth at Joann fabrics and folded a large piece under and over my flatware tray in the drawer . Silver cloth comes in several colors and is relatively inexpensive . <p> I also wash my sterling silver in the dishwasher . It works fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the silver away from any stainless steel in the dishwasher . <p> Its so interesting how brass has been so out of favor on the internet for the last few years and whenever I would read a blog post describing painting over a brass fixture of some sort I would gasp in horror ! Brass is a beautiful metal and I am so glad to see it is being appreciated again . A couple of years ago I scored a Stiffel Co. brass lamp for just $18 . I just love the fact that it was made by this amazing company , it has history , its brassy gorgeous , and it was so inexpensive ( and heavy ) . I actually just got out a brass pot with lions head handles that had been sitting in my closet and filled it with towels for my guest bath . Its lovely brassiness says quality , old world , texture , interest and more . Thanks for helping bring brass back and saving all of those vintage and antique fixtures from being covered in glossy paint . <p> Ketchup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some already . I have a few pieces I need to polish before listing them in my etsy shop and I used a dollop of ketchup on a rag to wipe on and then buff off . <p> I 've used Rub n Buff for various metal patinas for years ! I remember my mother using it when I was young . I just bought some the other day in bronze to change up a large metal scrolled sphere . It is going up on the mantel when I am finished . Right now it is kind of brownish looking . <p> Thanks for the tips , Kate ! So timely ! We moved to a new house with lots of brass that needs attention , especially door knobs will your tips work ? I also tried Rub nBuff after reading about it for years . I had HIGH hopes , but it was a total failure . It was the ebony black , which may have been the problem , but maybe I did it wrong ? Would love a tutorial some day ! ( if there even is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm so glad to read this post ! I recently picked up a bunch of heavy brass lamps ( three of them are Stifels ! ) at our local thrift store and have been wondering how long it would be until brass came back into style . I 'm going to shine them up and find some shades for them , and get them out into the light . Thanks for the tips on what to do when the polishing/cleaning does n't  work out I know one of them is pretty pitted , so I might be resorting to other measures . <p> Earlier today , I found our old brass champagne bucket ( which looked terrible ) and wondered how to clean it up . I read an article about using ketchup , and worscester sauce . Had the ketchup , so I tried that and it looks pretty goodmay go another round with that and then try this just for grins . The ketchup was real easy , but maybe its not enough well see ! Did n't  see this article til tonigh pretty funny timing ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of spray painting it a silver or ORB , but I think I 'll just polish it for now and save myself the effort . Judging by its patina , its definitely not the laquered stuff either . Yeah ! <p> I love cleaning brass and silver . Its so satisfying to get something from icky to shiny ! <p> I worked on a brass chandelier last year dismantled it , boiled the components in water with baking soda and salt , and then polished them . This was more effective for me than using Brasso to get the lacquer off . <p> I am amazed at your conscientiousness in putting together all this information for your readers . ( And you actually got a single picture of those fancy pulls at three stages which means now you have to go and finish the other two , but you got a fantastic photo . That kind of effort really shows ! ) <p> I am struggling to balance consuming a lot of design and decor information as I work on our house ( bought in September , so I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " trends " so I do n't  make decisions in favor of things that I will regret later , and really liked only because other people did . ( I 'm going for the Tatiana route here , if I can . ) But I am very , very proud of myself because I bought a pair of candlesticks ( they have a lovely natural patina , but they are n't  super-heavy , so I think they 're probably brass plate but now I know how to be sure ! ) that I just adored in 2008 at the Goodwill , and then I spent two years looking for three punched-brass votive holders to set in front of the row of icons on my mantel . I knew just what they should look like in my head , and I patiently waited for Goodwill to have some in , and eventually I was rewarded . <p> So I think brass has always been beautiful , and I am glad the design world is back to recognizing it ! : ) <p> Thank you so much for the magnet tip ! Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gorgeous brass strike-plates ( the original hardware was long gone ) but then I thought about the seemingly outdated fleur de lis-looking pulls on an 80s dresser Im about to work on turns out they were honest-to-God brass ! I scrubbed the tarnish off and now I have pretty brass pulls for my antique dresser that actually looks antique ! Finding replacement hardware for the ho-hum 80s dresser will be much easier ( and cheaper ) . <p> I 'm also an 80s kid and may never like shiny brass . Unlacquered brass is slowly growing on me . I wanted to replace the bathroom hardware in our house and now glad we did n't  waste the money . I guess you should time putting a house up for sale with the current fashion ! What was " out " when you buy it may be back " in " when you sell . <p> Great post ! I love brass and also just refinished two bedside tables with vintage brass plate knobs that I got off of Etsy . Some of them were pretty dinged up , I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to life . <p> Thanks for the comparison ! Its so great to see ! I mimicked brass , creating inexpensive guilded frames using rub n buff and loved it . LONG ... I think I 'm going to try the Krylon Short Cuts for my dining room frames . I appreciate the tip ! <p> Thank you so much for this post ! I was doing a bit o research on the ol internet and stumbled across this post . Exactly what I needed to know .

It 's pretty crazy that I scheduled a trip in the middle of the One Room Challenge , but feeling good that most of the products are in place for the final photo shoot when I get back . Today I 'm popping in for the Week Four update ! <p> One of my goals with this challenge was to get matching nightstands for both sides of my bed . It 's true nightstands do n't have to match in any bedroom and there are ways to mismatch your nightstands , but for this space I thought why not go with a set , one that adds a little extra storage to the room and I decided a chest of drawers worked best . <p> I had a tough time finding just the right set . I knew I wanted wood and white and they had to be just the right size to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightstands to be a little higher than the mattress with sufficient room for a lamp , book , candle , jewelry dish , etc . <p> Eventually I chose a pair of the Cosmo three drawer dressers for their size and shape . However for the space they felt like too much dark wood since I already have new stained oak floors , and the two dark walnut dressers are staying in the space . So what 's a girl to do ? Lighten them up , of course ! <p> - <p> I wanted a wood and white combination so that 's what I did just like with this chest and this dresser . Sure I 'm repeating myself but the look never gets old . <p> I tweaked these small chests by painting the draws a warm white and changing the finish of the super cool knobs from shiny chrome to a matte brass . Meet one of my two new nightstands . <p> - - - <p> My original idea was to make the drawer fronts textured with paintable grasscloth wallpaper . But when I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on between the oak and wallpaper so I scrapped that idea and went with just paint to give the dresser its two tone look . <p> - <p> I primed and painted the drawers an off white color ( first Zinsser primer then Ben Moore 's Monterey White ' ) . I also spray painted the unique pulls a gold color to mimic matte brass , both of these spray paints will give you the look . <p> - <p> Here 's the final result ! <p> - <p> Two more additions to the space are a set of club chairs to sit under the big window . I chose the tailored tufted Loft chair in Azure and I 'll be adding a faux fur throw too , both from All Modern . <p> - <p> . <p> Catch up on my fellow participants and their progress in Week Four below ! <p> I have the same nightstands in my daughters room . I think I 'll give hers a make-over too . Yours look fabulous . Have fun on your trip ! Sweden is one of my very favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stockholm . Enjoy ! <p> Nice job on the nightstand ! Holy smokes ! Quick question : did you use the Krylon Short Cuts on the gold spraypainted knobs / drawer handles as well ? I am just starting to experiment with gold spray paint and am finding that its trickier to deal with than flat colors . For example , a clear coat over gold often dulls the finish . Also , gold without a finish can " tarnish " if you touch it or handle it incorrectly . Have you ever had that experience with any of your gold spray paint projects ? <p> I love the two-tone look of the nightstands ! This definitely gives them an updated look . I 'm moving into a condo soon that has old wooden kitchen cabinets and I need ideas for lighting them up and updating them . Do you have any ideas , any articles in your archives that you can send to me at email protected ? I would greatly appreciate it ! 23102 @qwx883102

It 's hard for me to spend a lot of money on a rug . When I add together the wear and tear that comes from kids and pets on top of my everlasting longing for a new look , - it results in a- 2-3 year life expectancy on a rug- before I 'm ready to donate the old and move on to something new . <p> For my home , I always buy 6 x 9 ' rugs because that size fits my living room , family room , office , and dining room space so I can rotate them to my heart 's desire . I find 6 x 9 ' rugs are a little harder to come by since most rugs come in either 5 x 7 ' which ( for me ) is always too small or 8 x 10 ' which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my list of the top go-to sources for good looking and affordable rugs , the first places I visit- whenever I need to makeover a space on a budget. - Most offer plenty of options for an 8 x 10 ' rug under $300 . <p> I have purchased for rugs from RugsUSA over the past two years and have loved each and everyone of them . Although their everyday prices are great , they have even better sales on the days surrounding Black Friday ! <p> Target I love their outdoor rugs I have 5 now . Love their free shipping &amp; easy returns though Ive never returned one . I 've looked at the other place but the return policy stops me . If there 's a problem I do n't  want to have to pay for shipping . And they have a great selection of rugs . <p> Rugs USA and Wayfair are my go to place for finding affordable rugs , but I also started to look on Home Depot and Lowes website just to check if they carry the same rug mainly for easy returns . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I found it at Home Depot for a much better price . It can be tricky to find as every website seems to have a different name for the same rug . <p> Thanks for the tips ! Here in Finland large area rugs are quite uncommon and that is the reason while the selection is very narrow and costs a lot . Having good foreing store to shop at is the best solution , if in need of bigger rug . <p> I have the distressed Persian-esque rug which you listed as no.2 under Wayfair . I got a 9+12 from Amazon for $200 ! ! It cost me much much more than that because I live outside of the US and had to import it and pay duties but for those of you in the US its a great deal . <p> This is a perfect post , as I have been looking for a rug for our office for several weeks now . Many that I see are polypropylene . Do you have any of these , and if so , what 's your opinion on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they would look/seem cheap . Thanks , Kate ! Love your site so much ! <p> I 've used the indoor/outdoor made of polypropelene rugs in my house before , the quality varies by manufacturer but for the most part Ive been happy . It seems they 're getting better and softer in recent years . <p> Hands down Rugs USA I have bought several rugs from them the last few years . Always wait for the 70% sales . Free shipping also . I also prefer non-wool now because the wool ones would she 'd like crazy for a few months . <p> It depends on the rug , the cotton ones can be more slippery so a rug pad is recommended , but I usually do n't  use one with a heavier wool or polypropylene indoor/outdoor version since they often have a slight grip background . <p> Area rugs can really add something special to a room since they 're both beautiful and functional . They add texture and color to the home , and they can also help protect the floor from wear and tear . It 's especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are lucky enough IKEA has some great rugs ( the cowhides are fantastic ) and countless times I have scored big at Tuesday Morning . Sometimes I buy a rug just because I love it and I keep it packaged up to sell to my clients ! Shop often and you will eventually hit the jackpot. 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057537 @3257537/ <h> Painting a Kitchen Table <p> By Kate Riley March 1 , 2012 <p> Hello everyone , I 'm so excited to share today 's DIY project with you , it 's all about how to paint a kitchen table . Y'all know I 've been painting furniture and cabinets for years , but this time I tackled the painting of a kitchen table . A kitchen table is the one surface that will get the most traffic of any piece of furniture in your home , and since it gets the most abuse it must be extremely durable . <p> To paint an old wood table with success you need three things working together a primer that blocks stains and also sticks like super glue , an extremely durable paint with a hard finish that can withstand the banging of bowls and plates , and finally , a layer of protectant . <p> Let 's get started . <p> First , take a look at this pedestal table before the paint treatment worn out oak coated with plenty of ick and yuck. - Not pretty . <p> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you four choices : - A ) thrift store B ) thrift store C ) thrift store D ) Craigslist. - If you guessed A , B or C you were right , oooh you 're smart ! - It was $45 for this solid wood classically shaped pedestal. - My friend needed a table for her new home 's breakfast nook so I spotted this one and then decided to refinish it for her . <p> First things first , you want to sand off any debris and some of the varnish and that 's why an orbital comes in very handy use medium grit discs. - Doing it by hand is possible , but better to let this tool do most of the work for you . <p> You do n't need to get rid of all the varnish , the primer ( next step ) will cling to the surface , varnish or not . You simply want it to be smoooooooooth . Use your hand and closed eyes as your guide , if you can run your hand over the surface and it feels smooth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe it all down and start the priming phase. - There are several kinds of primers on the market and a lot of them state they work on glossy surfaces. - Not all of them are stain blockers though so carefully read the label. - The one that has always worked best for me is Zinsser I 've used it for years their Cover Stain sticks like super glue and blocks any wood stain from coming through , and also dries in an hour . It 's oil based , and not available in some States , but in my opinion it 's the best . <p> On most furniture the spray version is just fine , but on high traffic horizontal surfaces like tabletops , coffee tables , or bookshelves , I recommend the roll on/brush on formula it 's thicker and more durable for that reason. - Roll on two yes two coats for the tabletop ( allowing to fully dry in between coats ) . <p> Roll on one coat to the remaining surfaces , wherever the roller can easily reach . <p> Follow up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow the primer to fully dry for a full day. - Next , use the medium grit sanding wedge to knock down any unevenness from the roller on the primed surface. - ( The orbital is a little too strong even with a fine grit disc for this phase and doing this by hand does n't take long . ) <p> But be sure to wear one of these while you do it . <p> Once you 've wiped down your primed tabletop , again run your hand over it to make sure you have a completely smooth surface. - Now it 's time to paint ! - This is where it 's important to buy the right paint over the past several months I 've used enamel paints by Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams ( Pro Classic ) for furniture and both have really fantastic water based enamel alkyd formulas they will give you a very hard finish like you 'd get with oil based paints . <p> For this table , I 'm using the Ben Moore Advance water based enamel alkyd in Swiss Coffee ' . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I prefer to work with paint in temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees , not too hot or too cold , I find it helps with the open time , giving you sufficient time to apply the paint without any drag. - Apply two thin coats , just enough to cover , allowing to dry between coats ( usually 24 hours ) . - If you choose a dark colored paint ( say black , navy , or dark gray ) you 'll likely need three thin coats of the enamel paint . <p> Now here 's the hard part it takes 3 to 5 days for the paint to cure so that it 's sufficiently hard , so after your final coat of paint do what it says and wait wait wait ! - This is a tabletop and you need it to be fully cured before you use it to prevent damage to all of your hard work . <p> After a few days it 's time to protect it and you have several options. - I like the Brush on and Wipe On water based Varathane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention that method here ) but for white painted furniture , I 'm really loving waxes. - They will give you a soft hand rubbed finish and wo n't change the color of your white paint . <p> There are various paste waxes on the market , you want one that 's clear , here are three I commonly use but you can also use Fiddes &amp; Sons , Minwax , and Hannant 's as well. - With this table , I used the clear Briwax . <p> Apply a small amount and rub in circles with a clean soft cotton cloth for a thin even coating and allow it to dry for at least an hour. - Buff ( wipe repeatedly with clean cotton cloth in circles ) to a shine , then repeat this step two more times over the course of a day. - Make sure to buff it completely so your wax is n't sticky , and you get a nice matte finish . <p> You want your surface to repel liquids and stains , so a few layers of wax will help do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safe for use. - Still I advise you to take it easy for the first few days using it , the paint and wax are mostly cured but will be much more solid after another week has passed . <p> Here 's the tabletop up close before and after the makeover. - From dirty and spotty to fresh and fabulous ! <p> So those are the steps to take to get a beautiful result that will last for years to come . <h> 319 comments <p> I love your blog and I had a question . I have a table that is currently painted , but I have a lot of scratches . I want to repaint this spring . What is your suggestion for a table that already has paint ? Should I just use the primer and paint again ? <p> Depends Kristie , did you paint it ? If so , with what kind of paint ? If you bought it painted , do you know if its veneer or solid wood underneath ? These all matter . In general you can paint over a previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the table now , then in an abundance of caution I 'd prime it again . <p> Hi Missy , you want to refinish/repaint the table with any leaf that goes with it in the table like I did when I restained this table I included the leaf during the LONG ... With paint , its probably best to keep a small distance between the sections as you do each step so that they 're not completely stuck together . With this table there is no leaf ( sad but true the doner did not include it ) so I did n't  have that issue . Kate <p> Great timing ! I just refinished my table .. a vintage 1930s wooden doll .. I used stain and paint and was planning on using something to protect it this weekend and had been weighing my options . I had thought about poly but I 'm a little scared to put it on after all the work Ive done on this table . The top is stained and the edge/lip is painted ( the legs are painted the edge color too ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain ? <p> Lovely ! That is the same style as my kitchen tablethank goodness mine is in good shape , but I am not a fan of the honey country oak anymore . I guess styles change as we , um , grow older , huh ? I soooo want to paint ours , but the hubs freaked out when I mentioned it about a year ago . Maybe I should just show him how great this one turned out ! ! <p> PS . Still waiting on my paint sprayer guy for my side tables . While I wait , I need to pick up some of that awesome wax you mentioned ! <p> Wow ! That is absolutely gorgeous ! I have the near duplicate of this table out in my garage that I have been wanting to paint for years , but never knew where to start . Would the same method be advisable for oak cabinets ? Thanks for the great tutorial ! <p> Hi Shannah , the primer and paint helped A LOT to fill it but up close you can still see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but yes up close you can still see the seam in the table , more subtle with paint on top , but still there . Kate <p> You must have been reading my mind with this post ; I was just thinking today that I need to paint our kitchen table . I do have a question for you I am pretty sure our table is MDF and its black . I bought it at Target years ago for $200 . Can I successfully repaint at high traffic piece when its MDF underneath ? If so , should I sand the black paint off , or prime over it ? <p> Allyson , you can paint MDF with the same primer , its great , it sticks to all kinds of glossy surfaces like laminate too . Follow the same steps but do n't  sand it with an orbital , just scuff it up with a sanding wedge to get rid of any debris , smooth it down with a rag to remove any microscopic residue , then go to the priming step . : ) Kate <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needs to be repainted and I totally never thought about sanding it down and what kind of paint I would need . Will be saving this article for future references <p> Oh great question Christina , I keep forgetting to do that ! The gallon of primer I had in my stash , but a gallon runs about $30 but you could get away with a quart for around $15 . Spray primer is around $5 a can . The enamel paint is pricier , they cost about $20 a quart but they 're worth it . Waxes vary in price from $10 to $25 depending on the brand . Purdy brushes are about $8 to $10 and the rollers are inexpensive , a few dollars at any home improvement store . Kate <p> GOOD MORNING ! I know those of us from Chicago are up before you ( oh how I wish we lived out west ) but when you do rise and shine you might want to explain that you have to register with apartment therapy to vote for best DIY blog . I rarely register for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( : Your blog is truly inspiring . Love , love , love <p> This turned out beautiful ! And perfect timing on the post . My husband and I plan to start sanding and painting our dining table this weekend . We need all the pointers we can get . We are considering the task of refinishing the table our five year anniversary present to each other . Since the traditional gift for five years is wood . I cant wait to see how ours turns out . <p> hey kate ! i was wondering if you have tips for a kitchen table that itsnt wood .. i 'm actually not quite sure what my table is. is it a black pedestal table from the bhg line at walmart. ive been wanting to paint it white , but it has a really shiny almost plastic-y kind of surface . have you painted something like that before ? also , would it work to use a sprayer with the cans of paint ? you know , the kinds you connect to the can ? i was just wondering because my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike some of my painted furniture where i might see a brushstroke or evidence of a roller . just wondering ! : ) <p> Yes yes Jessica you can absolutely use a sprayer , the trick is getting the consistency of the paint flow just right . Not everyone has a paint sprayer at their disposal so I like to show how to do it by hand with a brush , but yes , if you have a high quality sprayer then go for it ! Also , if you have one of those MDF or laminate previously painted top tables froma Walmart or other furniture manufacturer , you can paint it with the same steps , you just do n't  need to sand the surface smooth you can go straight to the priming step Zinssers bonding agents work for glossy surfaces . Kate <p> Hi Anne , I find with the enamel paints the Floetrol really is n't necessary its best to use those for the other kinds of latex paints which you can still use , but often the more inexpensive brand latex paints do need that conditioner boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sherwin Williams Pro Classic ) are both such high quality paints that when you apply them properly they do n't  need Floetrol . Kate <p> The table looks great ! I 'm thinking of doing similar to a pine bureau I got at a thrift store . I want it to be very durable since its going in my toddlers room . Out of curiosity , what 's the name of the Sherwin Williams brand of enamel paint , similar to Ben Moores Advance ? I 've got a SW very close by . Thanks and keep up the inspiring and fun work ! <p> You are so lucky to live in an area where you can get a dry day btwn 50-70F more than a few times a year ! I only paint on weekends and I can count on one hand the number of times I 've been able to paint something in optimal temps : ) <p> Looks so nice and fresh ! Thanks for the tutorial , I love seeing what products/methods others use for painting furniture ! Were painting our stairs this weekend and using the Zinnser primer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I use a very high quality brush for applying the paint and very thin , just enough to barely coat for each round , this keeps brush strokes way down and eliminates that drag you can get if you put it on too thick ! With a dark color paint ( say black , navy or dark gray ) you 'll likely need three thin coats of the enamel paint . Kate <p> Hi there , I am ready to get rid of the early american oak orange wood look on my table top . Its an alder table with a leaf and Ive already painted the legs of table a few yrs ago in expresso melamine . I 'm now ready to tackle the table top , but want to try to save the grain of wood as my husband hates the idea of painting wood . Do you think with the primer and paint ( cabinet paint ) in grey that the wood grain would show thru at all ? That 's all my husband wants , then has givenn me the green light to go ahead and paint it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was specifically told never to use water based paint by the paint department at ace hardware , on woOd furniture . They said water based is not good for it and that I must use oil based . Have you heard this before ? <p> Hey CG it seems like my comment wasnt posted , but if it gets posted twice sorry . So I 'm confused because I was tOld at ace hardware never to use water based paint on wood because its not good for the wood . They said I should only use oil based . Have you heard this before ? Also I noticed your primer was oil based and your paint was water . They also told me at ace not to do that . : 0/ I 'm stumped . Fill me in oh wise one ; 0 ) . Ps . I almost freaked when I could n't access your site lol . Addicted much ? Haha guess so . Thanks for the post ! ! <p> Hi Debora , I can understand your confusion . Yes , its true most latex paints should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that raw wood prefers oil based primers and paints soaks it up better . In this case the primer is oil based so it works well with wood and yes you can put any oil or latex paint on top of this oil based primer . The reverse is not necessarily a good idea , I would n't use a water based primer underneath an oil based paint . But note the water based primers and paints on the market these days are getting better and better , and some of them have synthetic oils in them which allow them to act like oil based primers and paints . I think someday theyll get so good that we may not even be using oil based products in the future . but for now I 'm sticking with my Zinsser . <p> Love this ! I see so many of these big oak pedestal tables aroundmakes me want to try giving one a facelift . I noticed you painted against the grain with the primer coat . Does it make a difference if you paint with the grain or not ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought off craigslist . The lady we bought it from repainted it and swore she sealed it but definitey did not . Even with protecting the tables and chairs , by the time we got home some of the paint chipped on , and even after getting it in the house , the paint chips off way too easily . We noticed that she never sanded it down like she said and definitely did n't  seal it . We want to redo it ourselves but are a little unsure . This post will really help us . I have a few questions . Will it be harder to do since she painted over the already the table and never sanded it down . We can see the original seal is still in tact . You used a paint brush to paint with ; did that leave brush strokes ? Do you have tips for minimizing the appearance for brush strokes ? Thank you SO much ! ! ! ! <p> Looks lovely ! I have an Aris pedestal table from Pottery Barn &amp; the top needs to be painted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and should be painted by a professional . Kate , in your professional opinion , do you think I can follow these instructions but maybe use hand sanding instead of the orbital ( just to make sure I do n't  damage the veneer ) ? <p> Hi Marie , you can paint over your PB table , but yes , do n't  use the orbital , it could damage the veneer scuff it up with a sanding wedge to remove any debris that also helps your primer cling better IMHO and follow the same steps ! <p> You always have such handy tips , I need to start making a list . You have SO many things on Pinterest , I think you should have that little " pin " button on your posts that I 'm starting to see other people use ! : ) <p> Arrggg ! I can not get my vote to count . I must be doing something wrong . I clicked on the link you provided and then on your name on the ballot but what happens is that it takes me back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Annie Sloan Chalk paint work for a kitchen table ? I have used it for other pieces , and was planning on using it for a kitchen table . No priming is such a treat ! But , I am wondering if it would hold up as well . Ill be eager to hear your thoughts on this ! Thanks ! Allie <p> Allie I 'm a big fan of the AS Chalk Paint , I love it on furniture I have not used it on a tabletop though , just a console , a dresser , and an end table . They have both held up beautifully but they do n't  get nearly the same wear and tear as a kitchen table . You might be okay with it , I find it to be a pretty durable paint and the no primer part is a bonus , but you wo n't get stain blocking capability with it to my knowledge . Worth a try , but this method I mention is the most durable Im aware of . Kate <p> Hi Kate , Love your blog . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I recently refinished a banister and have a few small pieces of dust in the paint . I 'm tackling a coffee table and kitchen table soon and want to have perfect finishes on those . Thanks , Emily <p> Emily if working indoors you will have that issue of sawdust and particles so you 'll have to use plenty of tarps plastic or canvas work best . I prefer to work outside in a covered well ventilated area , but when I redid my staircase I had tarps everywhere and a small dust vac to help when it got out of control also there are different paper and plastic runners you can buy in the paint department with an adhesive edge those help too . Kate <p> @ Allie , I used Annie Sloan Chalk Paint ( Old White ) a year ago on my kitchen table and six chairs . I also used 3 coats of her clear soft wax . They have ALL held up beautifully ! ! I have a 3 year old and an 8 year oldLOTS of spills , crayons and play dough have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as the day I finished it ! Also , no priming ( labor and materials ) is a HUGE BONUS with Annies paints . You should give it a goI think you 'll be very happy with the results ! ! <p> I made the mistake of telling my daughter to put her freshly baked cookies on my black Pottery Barn table without enough padding underneath . Now it has white circles all over it . Thanks for the tips , I need to repaint Im using it to stage a 1900 Victorian that were renovating . Ill be posting pictures of it soon ! **27;73;TOOLONG <p> Love it and cant wait to get started on mine . My table is black and like the comment above , not a pottery barn table , but when hot plates were placed on the table it left white circles , uggg . So the wax is good to finish it off , no polyurethane needed ? <p> Wow Molly great question , I 'm not really sure I have n't worked with exterior paints lately beyond painting a house so I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for interiors though , so it really depends if the table will get any exposure to sun or moisture . Kate <p> These kinds of posts are why I fell in love with your blog years ago . You do the best DIY tutorials , especially painting ones , of all kinds ! Thanks for getting back to your " roots " and inspiring me to tackle our kitchen table as my next project . : ) <p> Thanks so much for posting this ! Im used to painting on walls , not furniture and when I painted my dining room table last time I was n't happy with how it came out . I 'm getting ready to paint it again and your tips will come in handy . Thanks so much ! <p> Sometimes when I see 82 comments I just do n't  comment , because well , that 's a lot to read . But I just want to say KUDOS for an outstanding tutorial . I have a table like that in better condition but its in a color I do n't  like . I love the way yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-do our table sometime in the near future ! Would you recommend the enamel for kitchen cabinets ? ! We are getting ready to re-do our kitchen ! Also would you recommend the oil based primer ? Someone suggested I use Gliddens gripper but that is water based ! <p> Hi Whitney I would defitely use enamel paints on your kitchen cabinets , in fact I know Ben Moore recommends their Advance for that purpose . I 've read really good reviews on Gliddens Gripper also Sherwin Williams Adhesion Primer as long as they have that bonding quality , you should be fine , look for language that reads " clings to glossy/laminate/most surfaces " that 's a good clue you 're working with a primer that 's good for cabinetery . Ive read some great reviews on Zinssers Bullseye Zero too , which is a low VOC primer made by the same company I like . Kate <p> OMG I love what you did with the table , I have always seen people try to " paint " ( and I use that term loosely b/c it usually looks hideous ) furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just proved you can do it and it will turn out alright . I just need to follow your steps for sure . Great Job ! <p> Love this . Especially regarding the wax , I learned I have been putting mine on wrong , yikes ! : ) Thanks for the tips there . <p> I have my Nannies dinning room table I need to redo . I already did her buffet in the AS chalk paint , but the table is a very thick heavy lacquer finish in a golden walnut finish . I saw your comment above regarding the AS for a table , and the following comment saying they tried it and it was great .. BUTwhat are your thoughts on sanding and priming ? I know they say I do n't  need to , but I want it to really stick and be really durable . Do you have any thoughts on this ? <p> And I live in Santa Rosa , can you just come over and do it for me ? ? ha . That 's a jokesort of . : ) Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your helpful tips . xoxo <p> Hey you 're so close Amy ! The AS Chalk Paint does not require sanding or priming , and Ive never used in on a tabletop so I cant confirm the durability factor on that particular surface , but it has n't  let me down on those other surfaces I mentioned ( dresser , end table , console table ) the sanding may help only because you want a really smooth surface to start with , but if you 've got one already , you could certainly use the AS Chalk Paint as recommended by another reader . you 're limited in colors of course , but it seems others have done it successfully . <p> Very interesting . I wondered if waxes were tough enough to handle the tops of a table . You use varathane , have you ever used the floor version on a table/furniture ? Just wondering because I have 1/2 gallon left from refinishing my floor and I 'd like to use it , but I 'm scared ! <p> It looks great Kate ! I have a farmhouse table that was done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , not so much ! Because of the distressing that was done to it I am not sure I will be able to make it look so fabulous as yours but I sure am going to try ! I am considering buying a glass cut to size to put on top of the table top . <p> I just bought a pedistal table at a resale shop last week . Perfect timing ! Mine is destined for our bonus room as a game/craft table so durable finish is also important . Thank you so much for the information . <p> Ok , well , I 'll give it a whirl and let you know how it turns out . : ) Thank you ! <p> Yes , was surprised when I read your local newspaper feature postyou are so close ! We were just in your neck of the woods on Sattook my in laws to see the Adobe only to find it closed for budget cuts ? ! ? ! boo ! so we walked around downtown . We love Petaluma . <p> ugh . I so wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have almost the same table .. decided to prime it ( and apparently Lowes paint people do n't  know which primer is best ) and use a paint sample on it .. I painted the entire thing since I so loved the color . Then went back and got a high gloss of the same color and painted over the satin finish paint sample paint .. and promptly watched all the paint bubble up and come off . SO .. now Im stuck with the worst mess possible and am devising a plan to start over . Meh . I so hope mine comes out half as pretty as yours is ! <p> I do n't  use place mats and I was wondering if any sealer is ok to use when you use paper plates and hot dishes . I would hate to go through all the work just to have it ruined by a hot steamy paper plate . Thanks <p> Hi ! I wanted to buy clear wax . Locally , I can buy clear Trewax , or Sc Johnson wax , or clear Briwax . They vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is there a reason to use one brand of wax over another when doing furniture projects ? Or a reason why one would use anything other than clear wax ? Any help would be most appreciated ! ; ) Thanks ! <p> Hi Stephanie , you can apply a tinted or dark wax if you want an antiqued or aged look to highlight details or crevices on painted wood but I do n't  advise it for anything other than stained wood . Yep , those waxes do vary in price , but in my experience I 've found they 're all pretty much consistent , so go with a more inexpensive version , as long as its meant for furniture that 's just fine . <p> Hey Kate ! I love your tutorials . Im have found a used wood patio set that needs to be refinished . Can I follow these same steps for a table and chairs that will be outside , or is there something more I should do to protect it from the elements ? <p> i just bought a vintage table i 'm considering painting white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and i 'm curious as to whether that will be a problem . i guess i 'd paint them separately and with the gap pulled open so that paint does n't  get in the crack and seal it shut . does that sound right ? <p> Sure Erin , like I did when I restained the pedestal table , I worked with the leaf in the table but pulled apart . Just be careful when painting the edges , preventing any drips into the inside . You might want to close it up after each layer of primer and paint to make sure it comes together nicely and gently sand the edges of the leaf to ensure it . Good luck ! Kate <p> Hi Kate , Ive purchased minwax finishing paste wax in " natural " because it was the only option at my local Home Depot . It looks light orange in the tin . Will it dry clear or should I keep looking for one that is labeled as " clear " ? Thanks for all your blogs I 'm not sure I 'd be confident enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily , what brand ? I think Minwax makes a " natural " colored wax but I suspect its for lighter woods like maple . You really do want a clear wax if you 're working with white paint , but it might not matter on dark gray or black . <p> Fantastic tutorial ! ! I recently painted our kitchen table , but it is not withstanding the wear and tear . I have little chips knocked out already . This will come in handy when I need to repaint ! Thanks ! <p> I have the same table in my kitchen . I originally painted with cece caldwells chalk/clay paint and waxed it with cece caldwell wax . It is very similar to Annie Sloans chalk paint . I was not happy with the color , so I lightly sanded the table , primed it with " Glidden Gripper " primer and painted it with 2 coats of Benjamin Moores Advance . I started this 3 days ago ; the BM Advance took about 24 hours to dry between coats and still remained somewhat tacky . This morning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not used the table in 3 days ) . What did I do wrong ? Thanks for any advice . Suzie <p> Hi Suzie , that 's so tragic ! I 'm so sorry to read this ! I have not used Gliddens Gripper although I 've read good things . The final coats of paint are only as durable as the coats underneath , I 'm thinking there 's something going wrong with teh original clay/chalk paint plus wax plus primer combo . So so sorry you 're having trouble ! You may just have to start over by stripping off all the layers , sanding down to the original surface and using a good bonding primer ( I prefer Zinsser ) to give you that guaranteed grip . Kate <p> I love this table so much that I bought one today in hopes of making it look just like yours ! I found mine on craigslist for $35 . Mine has raised bumps all over the tabletop . How can I fix this ? I 've never painted or sanded furniture before . I guess my question is , if I sanded the bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ? <p> This is the exact table that I 've been planning on refinishing next week love the tutorial.oh , and I got mine at a bargain rate free from my neighbors trash.along with 6 dining chairs from another neighbors trash ! Would you refinish the chairs in the same manner ? <p> Hello ! this is the exact table that I plan on painting next week during our Spring Break ! It looks beautiful . I got my table at a bargain rate.free , from my next-door-neighbors trashabsolutely nothing wrong with it . Also have 6 dining chairs also free , from our other next-door-neighbors trash ! Just wondering if you would use the same technique on wooden chairs ? Thanks ! <p> Hey Kate ! Your tutorials are fantastic ! Thank you for taking the time to share your projects . I am currently using this tutorial as a guide while painting a great resale find . Its a little cottage style pine coffee table that I scored for $20 . I 've stripped it , sanded it , primed it ( Zinsser stain blocker ) , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sand the primer a tad to smooth out the table top . ( The gentleman at Sherwin Williams told me that this was not necessary . ) And now , I am totally regretting it . Its not awful , but a little rough . ( To the point where I am not happy . ) I was wondering if you think I can give it a light sanding over the first coat of paint to help even things out . Any suggestions would be appreciated . : ) <p> Hi Jen , you certainly can sand the first coat of paint , but until you get that primer coat smooth , you 'll still see rough spots in the following coats of paint . Best to get the primer as smooth as possible before painting on top of that . Hope this helps and your coffee table finish improves . : ) Kate <p> I started painting my pedestal table this weekend . I 've sanded , primed , and applied 2 coats of paint . I used a purdy brush on the bottom and a foam roller on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was scared of painting the top with a brush . However , now I 'm wondering if I should have . My tabletop looks much more dull and matte than the pedestal . It really has no shine or gloss to it at all even though its the same paint all over . Do you have any tips , suggestions , or ideas that might help ? If you think I should paint a coat with a brush , can you give me some suggestions for avoiding streaks ? How long should my strokes be ? Any help is much appreciated ! ! <p> HI Amy , so sorry you ended up with different sheens ! I like a foam roller for quick application , but a brush for a sleeker finish . I work the paint back and forth in a rapid motion and with long strokes ( 18-24 ? ) and first in one vertical direction , then across it in a horizontal direction with long light strokes with the tip of the brush . At this point with your table you can try one more coat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can cover the top with a water based satin gloss Varathane finish I prefer the rub on formula . You could also really buff out the wax , that tends to bring you more shine too . Hope this helps ! Kate <p> I had sworn off painting oak furniture because of the grain but I think you just gave me the confidence to try it again . This primer and paint you are using looks like it covered the oak grain perfectly smooth ! I 'm so excited to try this ! THANK YOU for sharing so much of your knowledge with us my dear , I 'm always inspired by your projects ! <p> Hi Kate , I 'm getting ready to paint a kitchen table . Your tutorial has been a great help , but I 'm having difficulty deciding what I should do with the leaf . At this point , I imagine well want to keep the table smaller when it is just the four of us , but add the leaf for dinner guest . What would you suggest in regard to painting the leaf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , and try to paint the leaf as its sitting inside but allowing some spacing between after each coat is dry push it together and gently sand any edges where necessary so that its one smooth surface . <p> Hi Kate . I 'm going to follow your tutorial to the letter this weekend when I attempt to paint my daughters dresser . I noticed that you never mentioned paint conditioner , but from reading your other projects , I know you typically use Floetrol . Did you use it this time around ? <p> Also , when using Floetrol on projects for which you 've bought a one gallon can of paint.is there any harm in adding the Floetrol to the whole gallon ? I 'm wondering if it would be better to add it ONLY to the paint that I plan to use for each 24 hour paint/dry session . <p> I think I speak for every reader of your site when I say you are extremely talented and were lucky that you 're willing to share your knowledge with us ! Thank you ! <p> Hi Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only with other latex brand paints . I think its best to mix it in a separate container instead of directly in the paint , although it certainly wont hurt your gallen . And thank you for the kind compliments ! Kate <p> Thanks for this great tutorial . I searched all over my area for the water base enamel and could not find it anywhere ! I guess it is not in smaller markets yet . Should I just go with an oil base enamel to get that hard finish that I want ? What brand do you recommend ? Thanks for your help . I asked the employees at my local hard ware stores and they were clueless . <p> just found your site through pinterest . I have now spent the better part of my evening reading through your various projects . I have been wanting to paint my breakfast nook table but have been scared to since it is our main eating table . After reading this , I think I will do it ! ! I have to compliment you on your ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is very understandable . Every project that I have read I 've left thinking " wow , I could do that " . Lots of people are crafty , but not everyone can teach others how to be you really are quite talented . And after reading through your comments , you seem to be a very nice person as well , I 've found myself smiling throughout your tutorials . Ever thought about hosting a show on HGTV ? Youd be great : - ) <p> I just finished my table project and came across a little problem . I followed all of the steps . I used the Johnson wax and I am not happy with the results . The table has a yellowish tint where the wax stayed in some of the wood grain and the sheen is not consistent . Do you have an idea for a solution ? At this point I am ready to sand the surface and paint again avoiding the wax step . <p> Hi Mary , did you try buffing the wax ? That removes the waxy look and gives it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still unhappy , yes you could sand it down gently to remove it then give the table one final coat of paint . The enamel paints have a harder finish , so let it cure for about a week and see how you like living with it with no wax finish . <p> Thank you for your response . I did attempt to buff the wax . The sheen is uneven because some of the table is still yellowish as a result of the wax . ( I was surprised that even thought I used a clear wax , it still has a yellow tint ) . I did not start with a completely smooth table . I sanded off the varnish and any flaws , but since it is wood , I did not sand down the wood grain . That might be the issue . I am going to try to remove the wax a car wax removal product and if that does not work , then I am going to sand . <p> Primed my table last night and as I was doing so , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small indent on the surface of my table . Is it too late to use wood filler to fix it ? Can I just put in the wood filler on top of the primer , sand , and then paint over that spot with primer again or will that make the surface uneven ? Thanks ! <p> Hey there ! You are one Centsational Girl ! I am tackling my Goodwill pedestal table this weekend and am going for Black . Would you wax or use the Varathane ? It is used a lot so I want a strong finish . Thank you , youve inspired thsi " fifty something " to go back to my DIY roots ! <p> Glad I found this on Twitter . What a wonderful site ! The instructions on refinishing a kitchen table was very informative and gives me the confidence in redoing some of the furniture in my home . I would rather buy something used and repurpose it than buy brand new furniture that I can not afford . You have given me the inspiration I need . Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Amazing ! You have a DIY tutorial for all of my to do list projects ! ! I love that you show the products that you use that 's so helpful because I do n't  have much experience with paint and really use your reviews/tips on all of that ! My husband and I recently found a *free* table on craigslist and after some research we 've decided to paint it ( and the chairs ) black . Now , I noticed the " break " in the middle of the table ( before picture ) so I assume there were some leaves involved at some point ? Were the leaves not included in your purchase ? Did you paint the table " shut " ? I do n't  see the same crease in the after picture The table we found has 3 leaves and I would love to be able to use them all do you have any tips on how to best approach the painting of the leaves and also how not to complete paint the table shut when painting ? Thanks ! ! ! <p> You did an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided instead of getting ride of the one I had from my father in-law that was really gross . I decided to start my very first painting project ! Now can I ask why something like Ben Moore and Scherwin over something like Dutch Boy ? I do want to use the best for my table . But was wondering what those two do better ? I do n't  have much experience with painting , other than walls . Thanks ! <p> Finished my table a few weeks ago with 3 coats of the same brand wax that you used . Is it normal for the wax coating to get scuff marks etc when things are moved around on the table top ? Just wondering if I did something wrong or if its just something I 'm going to have to live with . Is that why applying new coats of wax is needed , to get rid of scuff marks ? <p> Hi Jessica , that sometimes happens if the wax is n't buffed to a harder finish , I 'd try to ever so lightly sand them out with super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUFF BUFf BUFF ( kinda till your arms ache : D ) and you should have a more durable top ! Kate <p> I 've started my table . Sanded , primed , and sanded . But then I had a few spots where , when sanding , the primer came off a bit . Do you recommend priming those spots again ? I seriously cant get over how amazing your table turned out ! Hoping mine can look half as good . I have a large table with three leaves , will a quart of paint still cover all of that ? Also , how do you get thin layers of paint ? I am so afraid of too much paint . Last question , because I cant seem to see it in your blog , but maybe it was therewhat sheen is the best ? I was thinking Semi-Gloss , but I know that High-Gloss is even more tough . Thanks a bunch for answering ALL of everyones questions ! Super wonderful of you ! <p> Hi Kate , I 'm going to use the Sherwin Williams Pro Classic paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint as well . Did you use the floetrol paint conditioner to minimize brush strokes or does it go on pretty smooth on its own ? Thanks , Gladys <p> I am getting ready to do my dining room table . I have 4 little boys &amp; was wondering if the Satin choice of paint would be best or should I do a semi gloss ? Perhaps the wax would n't work with semi gloss ? ? ? Just wondering . Thank you ! I love your website &amp; have shared it with many friends . <p> Hello , Your posts are always so helpful , I recently repainted my cabinets after becoming inspired with your posts . I cleaned with tsp , deglossed , sanded and primed with two coats of zinsser . I then painted with two coats of sw proclassic in semi gloss but my cabinets are n't  at all glossy . Can I used this wax mentioned above to make the cabinets look glossy ? If not , what product(s) will you recommed to get a glossy finish for the cabinets . On a side note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much : ) <p> Did you use the roller for the paint ? Or did you just use the brush for that ? Getting ready to take a stab at refinishing a similar looking table this weekend . Except we are paining it a bright orange . Deb <p> Kate , you really inspire me ! Because of you , Im now brave enough to tackle a long time goal to learn to paint/refinish old furniture . I know it sounds silly , but thank you ! I recently bought a veneer table ( ugly ugly , but it fit perfectly in my small eat-in space ) that I want to paint . Do you suggest sanding first or going straight to primer ? Suggestions on the type of primer &amp; paint ? ? Thanks again ! <p> Ok sorryto bombard you with questions . I realized I should just start over , I got off the paint + primer ( seemed crappy even to a first time painter ) . I primed with kilz latex primer . I picked out an enamel paint at lowes . They took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , they had switched my enamel can with a kitchen/bath acrylic paint . They promises to me that it was the exact same thing . Now I know that 's not true . But they had no enamel paint with a base that I could use with the color I want . Is acrylic paint a good alternative in terms of durability and such ? Are there any good alternatives to enamel ? Im having a hard time finding it anywhere in my town . Thanks ! <p> Hi Kalie , you can use regular latex paint but you might need an additive called Floetrol to lengthen the drying time and condition the water based paint for a smoother result . The alternative is to look for an oil based enamel paint , commonly used for doors and trim , I know Glidden has one and its sold at Home Depot . Kate <p> I am about to start the painting process of my kitchen table , but I 'm concerned with how the temperature will affect my paint . I live in a very hot and humid climate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the whole refinishing process . Should I still attempt to paint this table even with the temperature being between 80-90 degrees every day ? What problems could that cause ? Thanks ! <p> Hi .. I 've just finished two coats of the zinsser primer on my oak pedestal table . Now I 'm giving it a couple of days before I start painting . I 'm planning on using the BM Advance paint you mentioned . I want to do black . The lady at the BM store suggested I use the Pearl finish . Good idea , do you think ? She says its very durable and would n't require a protectant . Can you just use the wax on white tables or do you reccomend using it on the black painted table as well ? Just a couple of questions I hope you can help me with . Thanks . Love reading your blog . Always so informative . Your table looks beautiful and I 'm hoping mine can look that good . Bea <p> Hi Bea , the satin Advance formula may need a protectant , with black I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want satin or gloss . If you go with a gloss formula in the Advance and let it cure a few weeks , its a pretty hard surface , did that with my sons desk and was very pleased ! Kate <p> Still working on our orange pedestal table . How many coats of Polycrylic would you recommend for a kitchen table ? The can suggests 3 . And should we paint the Polycrylic on the pedestal base as well ? At this point my husband only did one coat on the table top . Deb <p> Hi Kate ! Thank you so much for this post . I have been studying it all week as I have been repainting some new pieces . I was wondering where you buy your waxes from . I checked Home Depot and Lowes and they only have Minwax in natural . I would like clear as you mentioned as I am also painting my furniture white ! Thanks ! <p> Thank you for this tutorial very straightforward and easy to follow . I redid a crappy old drop leaf table I got at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mini-gaming spot for my kids for their Xbox &amp; a small monitor , with the leaves down . ( 1 ) It just strikes me as BORING , I would like to make it more visually appealing , but not sure how . I tried scuffing it up for a distressed look , but am having a hard time getting the paint off . What about dribbling some liquid stripper here &amp; there ? Try a little stain ? ( 2 ) with the leaves down , the bare wood underside is visible , keep as is or should this be painted too ? <p> Q for you have you ever done a " Cerused " Oak finish ? i am crushing on everything Gustavian right now ! i have a very similar oak pedestal table to the one you painted , and wonder if you have had success refinishing oak with an american country vibe , into a subtle , elegant , grey-toned piece worthy of King Gustavs court ? <p> Hi Laine ! That graywash or limed oak finish is all the rage but you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak down to its raw state , then give it a subtle gray then whitewash with paint ! You can also buy liming products too , but I have n't tried them yet . Kate <p> Hi Kate , My daughter has finished her first project painting a small nightstand . It has been about a month now . She never put wax on as she was too impatient . Now it seems that the nightstand is " tacky " meaning her small lamp is sticking to it and the drawers are sticking . She did let it dry properly . Help ! <p> Thanks so much for an amazing tutorial ! I recently painted a media stand to reuse as a changing table . I sanded , primed , and painted with a couple of coats of latex paint . After a few days , its still SO tacky feeling ! Would applying the Briwax help ? Or should I give it a few more days ( we live in a humid area ) ? Or do I need to start over and do it your way ? : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to paint a table and I am currently sitting at my newly painted kitchen table . I do have one question . I finished the table with SC Johnson Wax . What can I use to clean the table without removing or damaging the wax ? Thanks ! <p> Hey , I recently painted a table with chalk paint and put three coats of annie sloan clear wax on . i allowed 24 hours between each coat and 1 week before I used the table . Everything I put on the table leaves a mark : ( is there a way to pull the wax off and use a different product to seal it ? I 'd love any advice you can give me ! I love the look of my table , but the marks show so much ! thank you ! <p> Hi Heather , the problem might be not enough buffing . When it is sufficiently buffed there should be no marks sometimes it takes as much as 20 minutes for each coat ( ugh ! ) but the smoother you get it the better ! Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table.I lightly sanded , applied primer then two coats of Benjamin Moore Classic semi gloss acrylic paint , allowing two to three hours drying time between coats.Unfortunately I have some dull spots , I am not new to painting and do n't  know why this happened.If I use the Briwax on it do you think that will get rid of the dull spots and even it out or should I use the Minwax polyacrylic to seal it ? I am really hoping not to have to start from scratch by sanding it all down . Would appreciate your advice . <p> Hi Kate , I just found your site and I love your work and your very detailed tutorials ! I need all the vital details I can getwhich other sites can sometimes leave out of the equation causing me a lot of hassle . I am a novice at painting furniture and need to be aware of a lot of the little details ( like how many coats of primer and paint , &amp; how long to wait in between ) . THANK YOU SO MUCH for this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paint that you used to paint the kitchen table . From what I gather , the primer is oil based , the paint you used is a water based enamel alkyd paint . My husband is adament that I can not use a water based paint over and oil base primer . Does the BJ Moore Advance paint you used operated like an oil based paint ? ? ? ? Can you please explain to me what primer(s) to use with what paint(s) ( plural ) . I 'm dealing with a husband and some men from the paint store who are from the old schooland they tell me Im headed for trouble painting like this . Can you please give me some clarification on primers and paints . Thank you so much ! <p> Hi Kim , yes you can use either latex or enamel or oil based paints over oil based primers , I 've been doing it for years . If you use water based primer , you should stick with water based latex and enamel paints . Yes the BM paint feels more like an oil based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cabinets . Bottom line , follow the steps I mention , they 're the ones I use time and again : a good bonding primer , my favorite is Cover Stain ( oil based ) followed up by enamel paints in your color of choice . I find I 'm using clear furniture waxes more and more for the protective coat , but you also have the option of Polycrylic or Varathane . Kate <p> I love your site ! Thanks ! I am getting ready ( tomorrow ) to refinish a kitchen table we found that was for sale on the side of the road . I am going to be staining the top of the table and painting the legs and decorative edge white . Do you still recommend the wax on the white paint even though it will not technically be in the high traffic area ? <p> I bought an old oak pedestal table that I planned on painting white . Thankfully I found your site with these awesome instructions ! I 've gotten to the point where Im ready to paint it , but I 'm having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Ace and they do n't  have it . Is there another brand that you would recommend ? Thanks ! <p> I too am following your tips as closely as possible . I have just put on the first coat of paint . After allowing it to dry , do I sand lightly or only after priming ? Thanks so much for sharing your wisdom ! ! <p> Thank you so much for posting this detailed how to . I just completed my first kitchen table and coffee table and they turned out perfect ! I used every item you suggested , and lucky or me Zissner is available for purchase in my state . It was a perfect primer . I went with Behr satin finish paint . I used Swiss Coffee for my kitchen table and sealed it with the SC Johnson Paste Wax . I have received so many compliments , therefore , had to take the time to thank you . <p> Hi there ! I just followed your step by step instructions for our kitchen table and I 'm a little disappointed with the turnout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and so my tabletop is just a mess of brush strokes . Any way to get those out ? I hate spending so much on paint and then having it turn out poorly . : ( Any suggestions you can offer would be greatly appreciated . <p> Oh no Heather ! You used a good brush and enamel paint ? I 'm so sorry ! You can always sand away those brush strokes , and then wax the top once they 're gone , feel free to send me a picture and I 'll try to walk you through it . Kate <p> Hi Kate I love your blog it is awesome ! I am getting so many wonderful ideas from you . Thank you so much ! I have just painted a table identical to yours before I found your tutorial . i decided to use Krylon spray paint and primer in one , white in the satin finish . ( I would not recommend this product for this type of project ) I wanted a smooth finish . I also used 2 or 3 coats of bulls eye water based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ended up using 6 cans of spray paint ( there was also a leaf ) I did not expect to use so much . The problem is I could not get the top of the table to have a nice even finish . Some spots are nice , and some are rough and some are powdery , like the paint was drying coming out of the can . I have spray painted in the past on large dressers and armoires and have never experienced this before ( this is one of the reasons I would never use this paint again ) My question is with all your experience do you know if I can use Varathane Diamond Finish WATER BASED roll on , not spray , over this Krylon Paint which I am almost certan is not water based ? Or would you suggest using the wax on the top , would this even out the finish ? Any advice would be helpful . Thank you in advance Lori <p> Hi Lori , I 've had that happen with spray paint before , you get even color but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Polycrylic that will fix it . You may be able to do it with wax too with several coats . Kate <p> Hi Kate I am normally not a DIY kind of person , but your painted kitchen table project was so beautiful , I decided to take it on . I followed your exact instructions on an old oak pedestal table that I got at a thrift store and I just applied the final coat of paint this morning , and so far it looks great ! I now will let the paint cure for a week , and then apply the wax coats . Now that I have a lull in the action , I want to turn my attention to the 4 wood chairs that came with the set . I plan to prime them with the same stuff used on the table ( Zissners ) , but not sure how to paint ? I would much prefer to use a spray paint since the chairs have a lot of detail and I am not sure how well I 'd be able to paint them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , and I want to use the same color for the chairs that I did with the table ( Swiss Coffee ) . I tried a tool call Crown Spray Gun which did not work out for me . Any other suggestions ? <p> Hi Tammy , you can certainly use any kind of spray paint on the chairs if you 've primed , Ive done that many times . Pick a color you like and go for it ! Congrats on the table too , thanks so much for sharing ! Kate <p> I cant wait to get started . I have a 22 year old small kitchen table that I bought for my very first apt. and want to redo it in white for my daughters room . I have one question . It has grooves on the top , and I want to know what you would recommend for those . Should I fill them with caulk , and if so , when in the process should I do this ? I always hated them . thank you ! Laura <p> Hi Laura , you can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it first before you prime and allow it to fully dry , sometimes you need to apply a few times and sand in between to get it smooth . No guarantee theyll be gone completely but certainly minimized . : ) Kate <p> I followed your instructions from the green dresser you did for a nursery . I was able to get all of the products you recommend and had no problem until I got to the poly coat . I let it dry for almost a week before attempting poly today . I can not find the wax formula here in Virginia so I got the polycrylic and tried to brush it on . It acted like it was caking up or maybe even peeling up the paint underneath . This is my first piece . What am I doing wrong with the poly ? <p> Oh no Whitney that 's terrible ! Sounds like the Polycrylic is not reacting well to the paint not sure why , could be temperature related Try a clear furniture wax instead , you should be able to find some if you hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thank you for this awesome tutorial , Kate ! I am refinishing a piece of pottery barn furniture that is fairly shiny . I have sanded it by hand with medium grit sandpaper black because I do n't  have an orbital sander and would prefer not to spend the money on that right now if I can do it by hand . I have n't primed it yet ( but I am going to ) . I just wasnt sure if I sanded it enough . I gave it one good hand sand , but since the piece started out pretty shiny and is still fairly shiny and very smooth and I 'm painting it from navy to white , I was n't sure if itd be necessary to buy an orbital sander . I was hoping you could she 'd some light ! : ) Thanks so much ! <p> Hi Kate , I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy reading your blog every day your house is decorated beautifully ! I was just reading through the comments on this post again after you linked to it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so I was hoping you could help . I painted a coffee table earlier this year following these instructions and I 've been unhappy with the wax on the top . My husband always has his laptop on the coffee table and the little rubber feet leave marks on my table constantly . They will buff out , but it only stays pretty for the 5 minutes before the laptop ends up back on the table again . I 'm thinking I would have been better off on using the polycrylic in my situation , can I just use that over the top now or should I do something to make sure all the wax is off the table first ? <p> Hi Richelle , that 's such a great question . I 've never used Polycrylic directly over wax so truth is , I do n't  know ! You can test in an inconspicuous spot I suppose . Any chance your hub would be willing to replace the offending feet with clear ones ? I see them all the time and craft and home improvement stores ! Kaet <p> Hi Ashliegh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , they are water based but feel pretty close to oil based when dry . Darks work just as well , the paint store will use a different base but they perform beautifully too . <p> I would like to do this with my black kitchen table . The question is : do they only have white primer or do you need a dark one ? Also I like the shiny look , will that be the case if I use the enamel paint and wax method ? <p> Hi Kim , you 'll be fine using a white primer , but you 'll likely need three thin coats of black I 'd go with enamel in semi or high gloss and consider skipping the wax , but the table will need two weeks to cure before it can be used . Kate <p> Can I use the Briwax to seal/protect painted white kitchen cabinets ? I painted them a very dark color in the past but over time they always start to chip on the doors that are used the most- now I 'm painting them a white color and do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestal table ! <p> hi kate , have followed your blog and its been so helpful in furnishing my new home . I want to paint my pier 1 imports pedestal table ( currently in the antique white color that it came in ) a bright white , to match my new walls , trim , etc . Do I need to sand it first or can I just do primer and paint if I 'm going from an antique white to a bright white ? Thanks ! Erin <p> Hi Kate , I 've followed your steps to refinish a table that was given to me . I 've sanded , primed and put two coats of oil base enamel in a light turquoise . I 'm in my 3-5 day waiting period before I poly it . First question , I put my paint in a sprayer and sprayed 2 light coats . The finish is " uneven " . I see some spots from the sprayer . Will this go way when I poly it ? Secondly , I bought a spray can polyurethane . Will this work instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and wonderful blog . <p> Hi Nicole , poly will certainly help if the paint sheen is uneven , but not if the color is uneven . I used a brush on water based poly on this endtable and it helped make the sheen even , but I used a foam LONG ... I do n't  care for the spray polys , they are always spotty when I use them if you do spray I recommend going over it with those cheapo foam brushes , they work for me but make sure you do it in temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees , if its too hot it will dry way too fast and you can end up with bad streaks . Hope this helps ! <p> I published a question almost a month ago and my post still has n't  appeared on the website My question is whether a table that has a polyurethane coat over a coat of paint should be stripped before following your instructions or if sanding is enough to take care of it . Thanks ! ! <p> Hi Elizabeth , generally Ive found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , you can get away with a light sanding before you prime just as long as your primer is a bonding primer designed for glossy surfaces . Kate <p> Thanks so much ! I used the spray poly : / and am not happy . It is spotty just like you said and I used a satin finish which just looks kind of dull . Should I go get a high gloss poly and brush on another coat to even it out and give it some gloss ? <p> Ok so I do n't  see my last post . Not sure if it sent . Everything that you said the spray poly would do , it did . The finish is spotty and uneven . On top of that I used a satin finish and it just looks dull . I love the finish on the peacock blue redo . Can I get that same finish if I lightly sand and reapply a high gloss poly with a foam brush ? Could I use varathane or poly acrylic on top of the polyurethane ? <p> Hi Georgina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a dark color , I 'd use a water based polycrylic or Varathane for greater protection , the only caveat is white , and in that case , those products can amber slightly over time , so I suppose you could use wax , but you 'll have to buff it out really well ! . Kate <p> Hi ! I 'm starting to work on a crazy projectrefurbishing an old pool table ! The table hs been in our basement for years . We bought it cheap off Craigslist for the kids when they were younger and its still in good shape but its ugly ! We are renovating our basement and I do n't  want to put this ugly brown laminate pool table into or newly decorated space . I want to paint it black with silver accents and grey felt ( found a Brunswick table that I 'm copying ) . What paint do you recommend ? I am priming with the Zinnser Stain Block . Also , it has some metal edges and thick plastic corners ( where the ball pockets are ) . Any ideas for these ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might just paint the metal black to match the table . It is kind of a copper color now . <p> Any suggestions wold be great ! <p> P.S. I followed one of your blogs to repaint a bed , dresser and side table for my sons room . They were my moms and an old mahogany color . They are now a cool dark black/brown color and look awesome and updated . Thanks ! <p> Hi Kathy , the wood can be primed and so can the laminate , you may want to scuff up the plastic corners in the hoped the primer will adhere but plastic is tricky . There are some spray paints for plastic out there , RustOleum makes a few but not sure if they make them in metallic sheens . Kate <p> Love the table .. going to do ours white also really soon , just wondering once painted and waxed what is a good way to clean the table for every day use .. mommy here with an 8 &amp; 3 year old lol so I am sure I will be cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone who is n't very crafty . I had amazing results . The only thing I did different was painted my table a light beige and antiqued the scrolled images in the wood under the top of the table . <p> My daughter and I have followed every step exactly on a similar table . We painted only the top . We chose a fairly deep red . We are to the last step , the final finish . My daughter wants to use the wax finish . Is this the finish you would recommend ? Several sites say poly is the hardest finish . We have put poly over paint in the past and had an issue with peeling so we are a little apprehensive about trying it again . <p> Hi Kennedy , the wax finish ( if you do two coats and buff really well between coats ) is a really good protective finish , the poly is fine for a red paint but it might slightly darken your paint so be prepared for that , you might want to try it in an inconspicuous spot first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hello ! Awesome job explaining the details ! Ive been saying I want to refinish our kitchen table and you just made me realize it can happen ! The problem with my table right now is that when we put a hot paper plate on it , the plate sticks to the table and leaves " paper plate residue " for years . Would the wax at the end prevent this from happening ? This table is about 10 years old so the " paper plate residue " is n't the only reason why I want to refinish but its definitely the main reason . Thank you so much ! <p> Hi Daisy , if you buff that wax well enough it does provide a really effective protective coat , sometimes it takes a full week or so to cure and I cant guarantee no sticking with everything but I 've seen that if done right , its a really great protectant . <p> Thank you so much for this tutorial . I followed your steps except I used a black high gloss oil based enamel for the color on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of furniture and I do n't  know what would be the best sealer/protective coat for it . I only have The Home Depot and an Ace where I live and they have not been very helpful on what to use . Can you help me , please ? Thank you so much ! <p> Hi Myndee , you might be okay with just the enamel in the high gloss , especially if its oil , that dries very hard , but you could also consider a polycrylic on top with a gloss finish . Minwax makes a version and RustOleum does too . Kate <p> Thanks so much for your tutorial ! I have a question though : I have an oak table that is hideous but with paint could be kinda cute . However , the top is oak laminate , not real wood , and the rest of the table is solid wood . Will this method still work ? Would chalk paint be a better option ( I have to get some paint my piano anyway-thanks for your tutorial on that ! ) ? Some advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site , thanks for all the great inspiration and tutorials ! I am hoping you can lend some advice . I just painted my laundry room cabinets white . The original finish was a natural cherry , which was pretty , but just not my desired vibe . So I primed with zinsser cover stain ( used 2 coats , which may have been a mistake ! ) . Then after that cured the approach time , I painted with 3 thin coats of Majic Diamond Hard in a satin finish . This is a water based enamel that was recommended to me by my local Benjamin Moore dealer . I wanted BM pro advance , but turns out not every BM dealer carries it . So they talked me into the Majic . <p> Overall , I am pretty pleased with how it has turned out , but before I put the doors back on , I am wondering if I should protect the finish somehow , and with what ? I do sort of regret the satin finish wishing there was a bit more sheen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if gloss poly would help add sheen and smooth it out a bit . They way they feel now makes me think they will be difficult to wipe clean easily . I have heard though that ploys will yellow over time , so not sure if I should do that ? Then I came across your painted kitchen table tut , and its got me wondering if a wax would be a good option for cabinets ? If it is durable enough for a kitchen table , would it hold up well on cabinets , and would it add sheen and wipe-ability ? <p> Hi Jolleen , if its sheen you want then you can add a protective coat , the wax wont give you any more sheen , you 'll need a polycrylic type coating which does n't  amber as much as polyurethane , but it still can over the years on white paint . If anything I 'd grab a small quart of the same color you used but in that semi gloss or gloss sheen and layer one more coat over the top , they tend to be wipeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry rooms and kitchens hope that helps . <p> Ive been trying to follow your tutorial the best I can , but I do n't  live in the US so almost all of the products you mentioned are unavailable here . I started with a pine table which had been varnished . I sanded perfectly , even sanding off all the varnish from the table top , but I missed the part on the primer somehow and ended up with a water based primer ( 2 coats ) but also continued on with 2 coats of acrylic enamel ( I could n't even get the brand I wanted because I wouldve had to purchase 4 litres minimum to get my colour ) before I even realised this . My question is that I have the streaky/patchy gloss problem mentioned by a previous poster is it a problem with my primer , my enamel , my brush technique , the paint brand or all of the above ? In which case , what do I have to do to fix it ? The primer did n't  even seem to cover the darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to be a 1 coatlame . And on top of that , 3 coats of enamel later , there 's still one area that 's slightly grey , but I 'm not sure if I 'm only seeing it as grey because it has a different gloss effect compared to the area around it . The weather conditions have been pretty much perfect as well . <p> Anyway , I was thinking I 'd liberally sand with 240 grit and do one thin coat and then wax . I have a mouse sander , but I suppose I should be doing it by handIm just that eager to get rid of the streakiness . As for the brushwork , would you recommend I brush in the same direction or perpendicular direction compared to my previous coats ? Ive been wondering if stroke direction has played a roleI even got a purdy brush , but needed to make a trip across town to find it . Its better than what I had , but it did n't  make any difference for the streakiness . <p> I also have the chairs to do should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be navy . <p> Hi Valerie , a stain blocking primer would have prevented that problem , some water based formulas are not stain blocking . I 'm so sorry you 're having problems with streaks , its a tricky process . My best advice is to use very thin coats and what I do is brush on in one direction , quickly go across in the other direction , and then back again in the original direction with the tip of the brush , almost dusting the top . The paint seems to level better that way , but its the longer open time that helps to minimize them . Sometimes water based acrylic paints dry very fast and so you get those brush strokes , frustrating I know . Look for primers that do have those bonding and stain blocking qualities , it should say so on the back of the can . Good luck ! <p> Awesome blog ! I too am getting ready to paint a table plus chairs . I have purchased chalk paint , would you recommend all these steps ? Do not wan to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor results . I know chalk paint is self priming , but would do the extra steps for durability &amp; great results . Your thoughts ? <p> Hi Joann , several people have written to me telling me they used the AS chalk paint on their table and it turned out great . I 've used that brand of paint on other pieces but not a table . You could certainly try it . I do like the stain blocking and adhesion properties of the primer I mentioned . Kate <p> Hi Kate , Thanks for your very informative and detailed instructions and guidance ! It is giving me the confidence to paint our kitchen pedestal table a BM Paper Mache white ( to match our IKEA cabinets ) . After the project is finished , I read somewhere in your Q &amp; A that you can use regular cleaners . Should the wax be reapplied periodically/how often ? Thanks for your help ! <p> Hi Kate ! I am paining my kitchen table ( and eventually chairs ) and am following your tutorial as closely as possible . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primed ( using the same Cover Stain primer you recommended.tinted gray ) . I went to Sherwin Williams this morning to buy your recommended paint in black . Since the Pro Classic does n't  come in black , he recommended All surface enamel paint ( acrylic satin ) and that it will be just as durable as the pro classic ( which I bought ) . I was planning on then finishing with a polyacrylic coating ( since I 'm doing black instead of white , I thought polyacrylic would be better than wax ) . The man at the store said that I do n't  need any " protective coating " over this type of paint , and actually said that the polyacrylic may interact poorly with this paint and cause more chipping ? ! I have three young children and want to do whatever I can to ensure the most durability for our kitchen table , so I wanted to ask you your opinion as what/if I should do a top finish coat . Also , when I get to the chairs I was thinking about using spay paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I still do a spray coating of primer.then black spray paint , and then follow up with either spray or brush polyacrylic ? Thank you so much for your time and help ! I love reading your blog and truly appreciate all the help and feedback you provide for us DIY attempters ! : ) <p> Hi Jamie , a good enamel paint can go without a protective finish ( I skip it on less regularly used surfaces ) but for a kitchen table top I do like an extra layer of protection and prefer the wax . Ive spray painted a lot of chairs , its pretty simple . First wipe them down with a deglosser , then spray prime like the Zinsser shown , then spray paint with several LIGHT coats after the primer is dry . No need for a protective coat over the spray painted chairs , you 'll find the paint when applied in several thin layers over a good bonding primer is sufficient . <p> Hi Kate ! Thank you SO SO much for answering my questions ! I have my three coats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-5 days for curing before doing my protective coat . I have one more follow up question for you regarding the protective coat . I have tried to do some research on the protective coating options ( hoping to avoid asking you another question ! ) but am still pretty confused . I know I want the " most protective " option . I know you said you prefer wax , but do you think that is my best option ( also considering I have a black table ) . Is there any downside to me using polyacrylic instead ? I totally trust your opinion , so just wanted to ask you which you think I should do in my case.polyacylic or wax ( again my biggest objective to gain the most protection ) . Thank you again Katie for your help and insight ! <p> Could I bother you to measure the diameter of your white table ? I love it and you make it look so easy . That table really looks solid and heavy oak ? Beautiful design . I was hoping to accomplish a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Life keeps getting in my way .. it is called a DH ! I spend my days driving him to DR. visit and to the grocery store , playing " Nursemaid " but such is life . Those projects I wanted to accomplish will get done when I get round tuit . " Thanks for sharing all your experiences , knowledge and skills with us . I love your blog ! <p> How I wish I 'd read this tutorial first BEFORE trying to paint our dining table ( which looks almost like yours ) We applied primer with a spray paint gun and it was Great . Then i decided to roll on a semi gloss Behr paint with a regular roller ( not foam ) and it did n't  cover well At all and left a slight texture feel/look to it . So we waited a whileand then I , not so smartly , decided to use a spray can to go over itthat failed because the spray paint was crap . SO we tried to go over it again with a Foam roller , again same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the other was borrowed ) and used behr in it.could never get the settings right and it left it totally bubbled and with a bad high texture look and not semi gloss at all- more of a flat sheen . SOits been sitting in the garage for a week and we 've been eating off the counter , as we figure out our Next step . Mind you the chairs are another horror story =/ <p> So I finished the table this summer and it is absolutely awesome ! Took my time to allow drying ++ during the humid summer . I was extremely worried about stains on the off-white table but they really do wipe out without any problem ! Had to be careful with my brush stokes on the final coat but it looks really high end-cant believe I was able to do it just by following your blog ! Thanks ! <p> Hi Kate . I am painting my dining table following your instructions to a T only difference is I am painting it in black . I got the Purdy brush like you suggested and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are very obvious brush strokes visible . You do n't  say anything about sanding after the final coat in your tutorial , so I am I to understand that the Polyurethan ( not doing the wax as I followed what you said and am doing the liquid protective coat instead for the dark color ) will get rid of the brush strokes ? Or should I be sanding before doing that to get rid of the brush strokes ? Help ! ! I 'm in the home stretch and do n't  want to mess up ! Thank you for your wonderful site and advice ! <p> Hi Kate thank you for the speedy response , I actually just went ahead and tested a small spot on the leaf with a 400 sand paper and it went down to the primer .. then I tried another small spot with a 1000 wetordry sand paper and it did the same thing . I read somewhere on here about paint conditioners to eliminate brush strokes ? should i sand it and put some of that in the paint and try again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ( but in black ) so I 'm not sure what I did wrong .. AAAHHHHH ! <p> Hi , I cant wait to paint my pedestal table like you have instructed . My question is what do you use to clean it after it is in its everyday use ? I like to use an antibacterial cleaner like fantastik in my kitchen due to all the kiddos but noticed when i used it on just an ordinary repainted ( not in any way as you have demonstrated , just a sand and paint over job ) dresser , the paint started to peel a little each time i did it . I definitely do n't  want that to happen but if I cant clean it with other than a damp cloth , I may just forget the redo and buy a new table . Some info , please . Thank you ! <p> We use the Method products from Target Norma , but I 'm not sure what my friend uses for the table I painted for her I can find out , but I was at her house the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just wanted to say thanks for the info . I have done some refinishing in the past but never with laminate . My practice piece was an end table that was a very inexpensive piece that we have had forever . It was dark and worn . I bought a good paint at Lowes but it was on the " markdown " table . 2.50 for a quart . I already had the primer at home . It was a warm sunny weekend so I thought now is my chance . It turned out great , I loved the color ( pot luck color when it is on markdown ) . I did apply a spray poly ( very stinky ) had to let it set for several days . I had it and wanted to experiment . I have used brush on poly before that worked much better . I am anxious to move on to a few more projects , I will be getting some wax and try that instead of poly . <p> Thanks so much for all your tips . I am finishing my stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treads , and I am ready for finishing with paint . My husband thinks flat paint will be sufficient , but I am more inclined to use enamel . Can you help me ? <p> Hi kate ! I wanted to let you know I much I love yor blog ! ! I 've learned so much with you ! ! I started my first proyect with a HUGE dresser that I painted white . Its almost ready , i just need to apply the protectant , but I 'm not sure wich one to use , I already have the Varathane water based poly , or should I use wax ? ? How diferent is the final result with each product ? ? What would you reccomend ? ? ? Do you have to reapply wax after some time ? ? Thanks so much and I would love your advise <p> Hi ! I am in the process of using your instructions for a cool table I found on CL . I am almost ready to paint the top but feel uncomfortable using a brush ( Im worried about brush strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint brush the best bet ? If I use a paint brush , should I load the brush pretty thick and make long strokes end to end ? What 's the best technique to avoid brush strokes ? <p> Foam rollers work well Lacey , you 'll need a few coats though , and do n't  worry if the first one looks a little textured , with two or three coats a good leveling paint will fill it in . I use foam rollers more and more for flat surfaces these days then I do brushes . <p> CG : I am in Canada and desperately searching for a clear wax . I bought Minwax ( as mentioned in your post ) but have since opened it and consulted with the company by phone who says NOT to use this product on white furniture ( it contains oil according to Minwax and will give anything white an amber hue ) . The only other product I can find is the SC Johnson Paste Wax ( as shown in your photo ) . Have you used this wax successfully on white ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems way cheaper than anything else you receommended ( which I ca n't order to Canada anyway ) . Let me know about the SC J product ! Thanks in advance ! Jenn <p> Hi Katie , I just found your blog and it seems to be great ! I was wondering , I am in the process of making an artist desk and need a surface that will not stick to fine paper , does the wax cause things ( paper ) to stick to it after a few hours of laying on the surface ? This seems like a considerably better option than having to buy glass to fit on top of a neat desk ! Hope this would work ! Thanks , Caroline <p> I loved your blog and all your tips . I already start my project and just found your blog now . <p> My questions are : I sand my table just a little and I used a water base primer ( Benjamin Moore Multi-Purpose Latex Primer ) . Do you think this primer will hold the paint ? Can I use an oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on top of this primer ? What is the best way to apply the paint ? Brush or roller ? Thank You so much ! ! ! Diana <p> Hi Diana , I do n't  advise using oil based paint over a latex primer underneath , but you can do the opposite , you can layer latex over an oil based primer . Foam rollers work great for me for even paint distribution , also Purdy brushes <p> Gorgeous finish ! Would these products and process work on bookshelves ? I need to paint shelves in my daughters playroom , as the original finish is very tacky and scrapes off easily ( poor original craftmanship ) . I need something that will not cause books or heavy boxes to stick after being in one place for weeks/months at a time , that will not scrape off , and that can be cleaned without removing the paint . Thanks ! <p> I have a very similar table that I painted a couple of years ago in swiss coffee , but mine has yellowed terribly , I used poly to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I start ? Do I need to sand and prime again ? <p> I just purchased an oak kitchen table similar to your painted table . The top is veneer and has a few places that have water damage . Bubbles under the veneer . Have you had any experience with veneer repair ? Thanks . <p> Hello ! I am trying to refinish the eyesore of a kitchen island that came with our house . Its all wood . I was hoping to stain the the top of the island , but I am fairly certain it is bleeding sap , ( which may explain why the finish looked so bad to begin with . ) Given the sap issue , I am abandoning the stain , and hoping to salvage it buy painting the whole thing white in the style of this tutorial ! <p> Two questions : <p> 1 ) Do you have any experience with the Zinsser Cover Stain on wood that is bleeding sap ? Does it work ? <p> 2 ) Let 's pretend I follow this tutorial , use the suggested primer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turns out fabulous . Do I dare finish it with polycrylic ? The reviews seem mixed in terms of whether or not the polycrylic yellows . <p> The primer *may* cover the sap but no guarantee , I have never used it for that problem but that Cover Stain is pretty good at covering most things , it even clings to laminate , so it might work . I 'm not sure which SW formula is best for kitchen cabinets , I 've always used Benjamin Moore Advance . A water based poly wo n't yellow only an oil based one . 23102 @qwx883102

I feel so blessed to be here , dipping my toes in the sand . <p> So many of us- have turned our attention to fall since the kids are going back to school , that 's what we do in August . To be frank , its one of the things I find frustrating about this industry , how the catalogs begin to arrive , always looking to sell us something for the next season instead of embracing the one were in . <p> Its business , I get it , but its left me feeling unsettled because life is to be lived in the season were in , not the one that is coming . Yes , autumn is lovely with its warmer hues and falling leaves , but cant we embrace summer just a little bit more ? <p> Leafy botanical and bold florals are a trend- still going strong. - Well see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a day at the beach on a tropical island is the definition of bliss ! Bold tropical prints went out of style in the 2000s because the old prints looked dingy and dated . Its nice to see them make such a big comeback because now theyve been reinterpreted in cleaner more modern ways . <p> Today Im- featuring prints from- lesser known designers and their tropical inspired fabrics found on Zazzle , Minted , and Spoonflower . There are a lot of talented artists out there that deserve to be highlighted because their designs are #imho far fresher . Being one myself , the exposure is welcomed ! <p> Here are a dozen new favorite tropical fabrics which keep the spirit of summer going . <p> On a completely different ( and serious ) note having nothing to do with island fabrics , - do you follow Humans of New York on Facebook ?

@@99057543 @3257543/ <h> Marble Fireplace Makeover <p> By Kate Riley January 4 , 2017 <p> When we purchased this investment property last year , one of the things I knew I wanted to change was the fireplace in the living room . It 's a focal point in the home and the first thing you see when you walk in the front door . I wanted it to wow a future buyer and make it a selling point too . <p> Over the weekend we finished the tile , grout , and Matt built a new mantel with the help of my dad . I love the look of this newly remodeled fireplace ! <p> - <p> This is what the fireplace looked like when we bought this house . Not horrible with its basic ceramic tile and a plain mantel that matched the light beige walls , but not very exciting either . And what 's up with that tiny sliver of tile in the middle ? That was bugging me . <p> - <p> The first thing we did was remove the old tile . Originally I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireplace meet the floor , but when I opted for luxury vinyl plank flooring instead of tile flooring I had to keep the hearth base in place for fire safety . Tearing out the old tile destroyed the drywall so it needed to be replaced . <p> - <p> The surround and base also required new drywall before the new tile could be applied . <p> - <p> Once those steps were completed I went shopping for tile . There 's a huge Floor &amp; Decor store 20 minutes from this house in Las Vegas so I stopped in to look for something that would work well for the design I had in mind . I was n't disappointed , I found the perfect marble stone tile , this is the Golden Valley Marble Mosaic and it has beautiful brown veining running through it . <p> You can order this tile online but I 'm super picky when it comes to natural marble or stone and a big believer in choosing it in person . I like consistency among the colors running through the natural marble and I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . <p> - <p> Instead of grabbing and loading up a bunch of boxes I hand picked each tile just to be sure the colors were similar among them . This is n't the case with manmade porcelain or glass tiles , but with natural stone there can be discrepancies so I like to pick out each piece. - It sounds- strange when I tell most people this , - but shopping for- tile is- my kind of fun : ) <p> - <p> I 'm making choices that will appeal to a lot of buyers so the style Ive chosen with the finish materials is transitional . I want the house to feel fresh and modern but I also want the finishes to have traditional roots . The medley of rich wood tones and a classic stone finish accomplishes just that . <p> I was drawn to these marble tiles because of their shape with their contemporary elongated rectangles . I 'm really pleased with how the brown tones in the marble pick up on the dark stain on the mantel and the floors . <p> - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require spacers during the process , but you can see below there were little slivers of spaces in between some of the mosaics which I filled with grout in the color Bone . <p> - <p> Matt and my dad spent an afternoon building the mantel . They built it out of birch purchased from Lowes , they built a basic box to go around the old mantel . They mitered the corners then used a brad nailer to piece it together and secure it to the old mantel , it 's a big improvement to the basic mantel that was there before . <p> - <p> - <p> I applied one coat of- walnut stain to the birch wood to give the mantel a balanced look with the floor . ( I still have to go back and apply a coat of clear wax to protect it for the future . ) <p> - <p> I 'm so pleased with the new look of this fireplace ! ! <p> - <p> - <p> The new fireplace and flooring dramatically change the look of the living room ! ( Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textured smooth and painted fresh white . ) <p> - <p> - <p> Of course I had to style it with a few accessories just to show it off : ) <p> - <p> I 'll have more spaces to share in February when the bathrooms in this house are done ! <p> This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Floor &amp; Decor . The opinions and text are all mine . <p> Its beautiful , Kate ! Thanks for taking the time to give step by step directions . You make it sound doable : ) . You make an excellent point about shopping for tile in a store , especially if it is as visible as this is . <p> The marble really sets it off nicely ! Great choice . I also really love how you propped up framed colorful art on the fireplace ! I just pinned it to my fireplace decor ideas pinterest board . Thanks for sharing ! 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057545 @3257545/ <h> One Room Challenge : Fireplace Makeover <p> By Kate Riley April 19 , 2017 <p> Its Week Three people ! Were halfway through the One Room Challenge and you want to know something completely crazy ? Right now I 'm on an 11 day trip to Scandinavia . I landed in Copenhagen this morning where I 'll be for three more days and then I 'll be visiting Norway and Sweden . Am I crazy to take this trip in the middle of the One Room Challenge ? Yes . Certifiably . Rest assured I 've got it mostly under control and another ORC post scheduled next week . So let 's talk tile . <p> Corner fireplaces are a struggle . I mean I get it . Somewhere along the way someone wants to squeeze a fireplace into a room and not take up a lot of wall space and so someone makes this decision " Let 's just tuck it into a corner . " Personally , I prefer a fireplace on a straight wall to allow for a full mantel surround and for it to be a focal point and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my master bedroom , but that 's just me being picky . <p> I have a gas fireplace in my master bedroom and in the winter I will confess that its heaven being able to turn it on to warm up the space . I can read my book and drink a glass of wine by the firelight , who would n't love that I ask you . Yes , Im spoiled . <p> However when I look at it spatially I am irked that the fireplace is in a corner . Yet it was something that had to be reckoned with in this One Room Challenge in this process to makeover my bedroom . Previously there lived an odd mantel made of sheetrock coupled with some not so terrible off-white marble tile . ( See below . ) The tile was n't bad , it was the strange mantel that bugged me . <p> My inspiration for my fireplace makeover was a look that was more contemporary , like those tile installations that go floor to ceiling with nothing more . Like this and this and this but with a classic marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . here 's how it turned out ! <p> I partnered with Floor &amp; Decor on this project because it made so much sense . I 've worked with them many times in the past and enjoy the experience of shopping for tile so much more so than shopping for shoes . <p> I took a trip to the closest Northern California store in search of a large scale marble pattern tile for the wall and easily found it there . There are dozens of marble tiles to choose from in all shapes and sizes and in bold to subtle patterns . The one I chose was the Volakas Porcelain Marble in 12 x 24 ? and it was a great deal at $1.99/square foot . <p> here 's a look at the fireplace before we began , you can see that funky drywall mantel and the not so horrible tile . <p> We removed the old mantel in in less than an hour , Matt did most of the dirty work . After that Matt patched the drywall to prep it for the new tile . <p> I 've done a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I documented them here and you can find a zillion tutorials online . Smaller tiles and mosaics are easy but when you 're working with large scale tile like the 12 x 24 ? tile I chose , installation can be trickier . <p> First , every piece is so heavy and if you 're building up a wall you need to make sure there is sufficient mortar on the wall to hold it and also a strong base to support it . After all each row is sitting on top of one another and the last thing you need is for it to come off the wall or cave in or something tragic like that . Second , you have to really think where you want the tile to be in the final outcome which takes MATH . <p> I knew I wanted the focal point piece of tile to sit right smack dab center above the fireplace , and I did n't  want any crazy cuts or grout lines there so I convinced Matt we needed to work backwards and outward from that point . We needed to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit front and center , but then subtract the distance to the floor , make the cuts and build up to it . I know it sounds weird but its what made sense in my head . And it worked . <p> So we nailed a piece of wood to the wall to create the tile support for that focal point row of tile . <p> Following the math , we ended up with the first row cut down a few inches to the proper measurement and started building up from there . <p> At the end of Day One the math ended up being correct and I knew I had the proper distance between the floor tile and the center row tile above the fireplace and called it a day . <p> One Day Two we filled in the remaining pieces . This is a strange out of focus picture but it shows what was the most difficult cut , the L shape that sits at the bottom of the fireplace . That L shape ended up at the bottom of the fireplace instead of at the top which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math and started with full size tile at the floor and worked my way up . <p> I should mention I like thin grout lines so I worked with 1/16 ? spacers and also used grout in the Frost color to fill in between the tile once it was set . <p> And you do want to ensure each row is level as you make your way up the wall ! <p> here 's a little trick for thin grout lines . We used a plastic bag filled with- grout to squirt it into the gaps , kinda like you 're decorating a cake , and then used the grout float to wipe away any excess , it worked great ! <p> And here 's another stroke of luck : the grout line is the exact place I need to drill to hang the mirror I found for this wall so I do n't  need to drill into the tile itself . Serendipity ! <p> I really do love this tile for its subtle pattern , large shape , and matte finish . <p> More pictures of the fireplace and the final decor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final reveal coming on May 10th . <p> More bloggers are making progress in their One Room Challenge spaces , catch up with them all below ! <p> Looks great ! Ca n't wait to see the rest . Can you tell us about the trip . Did you use a company to plan it all ? Was it a special ? My friends want to do there next year . I would love to hear the details so we can know where to start with our planning process . <p> Kate ! I hope you are enjoying your trip ! The fireplace looks awesome . Please tell me that you are not getting rid of your beautiful Z gallery mirror that you had above your bed , if soI want it ! ! ! I love that mirror ! <p> Thanks so much for this write-up !

The slatted wood bench is from West Elm but its five years old and was looking weathered and shabby so I lightly sanded it and gave it two coats of Minwax stain in Ebony to refresh it for the season . <p> Hi Lisa ! The plants are available at local retailers . They have a retail center locator on the website : LONG ... Also , if they have trouble finding any of the varieties you can shop online : plantsbymail.com <p> I love your court yard and have had the pleasure of enjoying wine there !

I 'll be back to that regular- post next weekend , pinkie swear . One thing I did accomplish was finishing- up a project I 've had on the back burner , this one- was a learning process with a great end result ! <p> I spied these tassel pillows at Urban Outfitters and loved the look of the dyed cloth with matching tassel fringe so I set out to recreate a DIY version . <p> - <p> I had to prep for this project ahead of time by purchasing liquid dye at my local craft store , and also ordering three- varieties of cotton fringe from this Etsy shop . <p> - <p> This was my first time dyeing fabric and- it was a success ! I bought my thread after I dyed my fabric and let it dry . There 's really no knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited until my dyed fabrics were dry to color match the thread for this project . <p> - <p> Dyeing fabric is n't complicated , - one thing you do want to do is use a cloth made of natural fibers like cotton or linen since artificial fibers do n't  absorb dye .

@@99057552 @3257552/ <h> How to Mismatch Nightstands <p> By Kate Riley January 23 , 2014 <p> A local friend is sprucing up her bedroom and the husband and wife have no nightstands . They 're going back and forth on a pair of nightstands for the bed , he wants storage for his reading material , she wants something pretty and leggy and I was sharing with them that it 's possible to have different bedside tables because nightstands need not match . <p> There are other reasons for this design dilemma , sometimes a master bedroom does n't have the space for a matching set , or the preferences for the purpose to be served are different . Sometimes the room is simply in transition and the couple is temporarily working with what they 've got while they shop for an ideal solution . In case you 're dealing with the same issue , I 've rounded up a few ideas for my friend ( and for you ! ) <p> Partner Similar Styles . A good strategy is to combine bedside tables that relate to each other in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ( traditional , elegant , cottage , etc. ) and pair pieces that coordinate based on that style . Another option is to choose pieces from the same manufacturer or line of furniture and simply opt for different shapes . <p> Similar Size . A pair of nightstands or dressers that are different styles but share the same height and visual weight can be a successful combination and one that serves the preferences of whomever sleeps on that side . <h> 38 comments <p> I always took it to be a truth that nightstands had to match until I moved into my first apartment , and all I could afford were a few mismatched tables from Salvation Army . My love affair with " Eclectic " began ! <p> The two night stands in our master where bought from two different flea markets . One has been completed and the other is still in its original state . Its on the to-do list , so hopefully well do a blog post on it soon . Well tie the two together by painting them the same color and using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was matching nightstands rule . My husband has a narrow thrift shop nightstand with drawers to stash his odds and ends . I repainted and stenciled it . I have a small bed side table with three open shelves for my books and a few baskets . My husband is an avid reader , but he does n't  read in bed like I do . <p> This was the perfect post for me today . I have matching nightstands but they are too small for the space and I am looking for some new ones to replace them , I was thinking about getting 2 different ones but did n't  know if that would look good or not . <p> Our night stands do n't  match . I like storage but our bedroom is small so we have one with storage and the other is round , glass , and leggy . Two big pieces would be too bulky . I 'm in the market for new lamps , hopefully a pair will unify them ! <p> So I notice that in most of the photos , the nightstands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass-topped cube-shaped tables from Pottery Barn that I love , but they 're shorter than the bed . Do you think that looks awkward for nightstands ? <p> Hi Nicky , I think it just depends . I prefer a height that 's within a few inches of the mattress , not too much taller , not too much shorter , for that convenience of reaching over for your glass of water , glasses , or to turn out the lamp , etc . Since bed/mattress heights vary , I think its best to get the height of your nightstands as close to that if possible , but as you can see from some of the examples , its not written in stone . <p> We have mismatched nightstands . One of them is actually our old living room end table . Thank you for assuring us that its ok not to match ! I feel better about my room now that I 've seen all the fabulous pictures you put together for us ! <p> you know , this is such a great post ! obviously i do n't  have the mismatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black &amp; gold nightstands ; ) but i always had it in my head that mismatched nightstands are a faux pas . I 'm just happy to know that it really does n't  matter ! or that there are many ways you can make it work . Thanks for this ! <p> I have n't been this excited over a post in a long time this post has been bookmarked and shared with my husband because we are **27;252;TOOLONG to find new bedroom furniture for us ( 11 years of using the set his mother purchased for him when he went off to college , yuck ! ) and I do n't  have a clue where to start ! I do know I DO NT want perfectly matched pieces and I want to mix fabric-covered headboard with a wooden desk with some metal and or glass nightstands . I have ideas ! I just needed the validation ( from you today , thank you ! ) that my ideas could turn into great possibilities . Love it . Thanks ! <p> I am all about eclectic style , and I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching nightstands . She did it out of space constraints , but it looks perfectly fine . I am working on a plan for my master bedroom where my husband enjoys reading in bed , so I will have something that would fit is needs . For myself I would get something that would hold just the small essentials that I need by my bedside . Love the idea . <p> While browsing , houzz.com I came across a really beautiful room with beautiful console tables used as night stands where there was more than one surface to keep the essentials . <p> My side is a simple desk with chair . His side is TWO matching night stands pushed together , forming something like a console . Finish , height and length of the two ( three ? ) are similarbalances room . I love the double duty of having a desk/vanity for bedside table . <p> All my adult life ( in my 60s now ) I 've never had matching nightstands nor matching lamps and the design police have not arrested me . While I like symmetry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to have what I 'm drawn to rather than worry about being matchy . Good post ! ! <p> This was so inspiring . I currently have matching stands , but from a bedroom set bought from the previous homeowner . Some day when I am ready for new furniture or maybe just want to change up the nightstands , I will take this into consideration . I like how using the same type artwork , mirrors or lamps makes it all becomes balanced . A few years ago , my in-laws decided to change just their nightstands while keeping the rest of their furniture . They opted for two Bombay chests because they wanted the extra storage ( each had 3 large drawers ) . Although they were matching , it was just such a different option to the traditional night stand and really looked nice . And their " headboard " is a piece actually made by my father-in-law to look like a white picket fence with flowers going through it . We do n't  all have to conform ! Many thanks for the lovely photographs and inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this inspiration ! I 'm on the hunt for nightstands and its refreshing to know that they do n't  have to match , which makes sense because my husband and I are very different people . It would be nice to have a bit of our personalities mixed in . <p> Our bedside tables are mismatched . We have a smaller bedroom so for space reasons one side has my husbands dresser as a nightstand and the other has a small round table . We the look together with matching lamps . I love the symmetry that matching night stands and lamps at the bedside brings One day when our room is laid out differently I 'd like to try that look too now , I like to think of my bedroom as more eclectic with the non-confirming night stands ! <p> Our hardwood floors have tracks marking the routes of oft-uprooted nightstands over the years . Small dressers , desks , wine crates , barstools and inverted wastebaskets all have had the opportunity to perform in the coveted role . As long as there is a place for the Kleenex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog-eared design mags , the hair clips , the earrings , the thrift store lamp , the Vicks Vapo-rub ( just in case ) and the forgotten rosary beads , were good to go . Most successful are the pieces that stand high enough to avoid having a tossed-away pillow take out the entire collection in the still of the night , water and all . Very nice post ! <p> We have matching nightstands that came with the bedroom set Jim bought before we met . I have been searching for something mismatched , because I hate the look of a matching suite of bedroom furniture . Also , our furniture is just too large . The nightstands have to face in towards the bed in order to fit in the room ! <p> Youve given me some great ideas . Now I just have to find what I 'm looking for ! <p> I prefer mismatched nightstands , on one condition : they have to be the same height , so that lamps top out at the same eye level , or lights have to be wall-mounted so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's dealt with , I do n't  care if they 're of similar styles or even hues ; in fact , sometimes I like them better if they 're not ( as long as the rest of the room is fairly restful ) . Thanks for introducing the topic , Kate . <p> You have given me so much inspiration . The reason Ive been so Ho Hum decorating our home first of all is because we downsized and nothing seems to work . Secondly I did n't  find my inspiration style . I really liked all the decorating that I saw but it was n't " me " . I have found what I want and now its a matter of making it work . You are really great with the ideas and how you find good photos . Do you have a special technique ? <p> Kate , another great post . The older ( Wiser ? nah ! ) I get , the more allergic I am to matchy anything . I wish I had learned this years ago . Scale and proportion are so much more important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fun post ! My late husband and I had non-matching nightstands . He found a small 3-drawer chest with marble top which worked great for him while I used an old drum table he had that did n't  fit anywhere but looked great with a romantic tablecloth and had room for my stuff . Now on my own , I still have the chest/table arrangement which works for each side of the large bed wall . <p> Nicky , if not too troublesome , try one of the Pottery Barn tables or something the same height to see if it works for you and your husband before you commit . What looks good does n't  necessarily work for everyone . I find shorter nightstands to be uncomfortable for me and actually prefer them to be at or even slightly higher than the bed , but that 's me . And , as CensationalGirl says , mattresses are different heights so that has to be considered as well . <p> Ours do n't  match , mainly because when we first moved in together years ago , I was the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " did n't  need one " and piled all of his crap on the floor . Eventually , I just came home with a thrifted table and put it on his side . He loved it . Hahaha . <p> Your post is timely , as I have been on the hunt for the perfect side tables and chest to coordinate with the linen headboard I bought from Restoration Hardware . I did n't  want to get the ones that were shown in the store , since I did n't  want to have the room to have the matchy look . But its been 2 years and I still have n't found anything within a reasonable price . So , I opted for the round skirted table from Ballards Design for my sided the bed . I 'm still looking for my husbands side . I do like both end tables to be the same height and have matching lamps . I prefer some symmetry to the room . <p> Love this ! My husband and I actually just bought a pair of matching nightstands , although we were planning on mismatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same one ; ) So now our dilemma is this : we have this amazing vintage lamp that works perfectly on hubbys nightstandbut no match for mine . How do we coordinate lamps now that our bed/nightstands/windows are very symmetrical ? ? <p> Very cool ideas and great visuals on your blog ! I always start with the headboard because its typically the largest piece in the bedroom , but having mismatched nightstands really helps break the room up and makes it a lot more interesting . <p> Kate , do n't  know if you 'll read this but thanks again for this post on mismatched bedside tables . I really do like what I have but I 've also realized that a round table with tablecloth is romantic and looks quite nice with all the other squared items in the room but there 's no place to store anything . Its a 32 ? round top perfect size for corner ( wall space almost 4 ' to right of bed and 3-1/2 ' to window ) and easily accommodates everything I need at night . But everything ends up getting piled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try to straighten up , I do n't  have a place to " sweep " stuff . So thinking about plan B maybe a slightly different use for that fairly large corner that would serve as both a bedside table but dresser or desk of some kind with drawers . Have already found some ideas and inspirations from your pix above . Should be fun since no rush . 23102 @qwx883102

Actually , taking any kind of nap feels like a luxury : ) - But one stolen outdoors is extra special , I insist on- one whenever I go someplace warm on vacation , I affiliate- an outdoor nap- with ultimate relaxation . <p> We have a large sofa in our courtyard but it 's hard to catch zzzs there since the space is pelted with afternoon sun in the summer . My neighbors have an outdoor bed I envy , it 's a carved wood bed that has weathered over time , and she dresses it in exotic textiles and colorful pillows every summer . Their yard is so inviting , I await my annual invitation to share sangria just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me she 's fallen asleep on it countless times on summer evenings while her husband strums his guitar in an adjacent chair . Is n't that the most romantic lovely thought ? <p> Love your post ! My husband and I actually sleep outside when weather permits . We have two extra wide cushioned chaise lounges that we push together and cover with fitted sheets and light down comforters . We live in Palm Springs , CA and when the days get warmer but the nights are in the 70s , we love grabbing the pillows off our bed and heading outside . The lounges are under a patio cover and bugs like mosquitos are not an issue here in the desert . We consider it a real treat to be able to do this and there is nothing quite like waking for a moment in the middle of the night and seeing palm trees silhouetted against an incredibly starry sky .

I fell asleep right there on my blanket on the sand , and my favorite was waking up next to the lake . Waking up to that lovely breeze , the lake , sea gulls It was the best nap I ever took ! <p> To be honest , most of these have me thinking about what a drag out would be to keep hauling the mattress and cushions in and out for rainy weather . That would maybe happen two times a year . And then there will be birddroppings and leaves on the canopy and mold on the cushions from the few times you were to tired to bring them back in My favourite memory would be falling asleep on a slate I propped against the wall , to read to my mom while she gardened after school . I just closed my eyes for a minute in the autumn sun . I do n't  know why but I never felt so relaxed after a nap again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I would love a swinging bed .

My sister and I used to spread blankets and towels out on the grass and take naps outside when we were kids . I also remember stretching out on towels to dry off after swimming and dozing off in the sun . But now I live in Wisconsin and summer = mosquitos so I do n't  really ever sleep outside now ! How do they keep those outside spaces looking so nice ? It seems like a maintenance nightmare .

Ill be documenting the process from time to time on the blog , this month the focus is on the outdoors . Yesterday we met with a landscaper to improve the front yard and upgrade the landscaping , last week the contractor we hired finished up the pool remodel in the rear yard . <p> Soon we will turn our attention indoors , there are popcorn ceilings to be scraped and cabinets and flooring to be removed . This renovation is for resale so we plan to remodel , stage , and sell it . Were hoping to be done by fall but since its an out of state project which requires traveling back and forth once a month to check on progress , were staying flexible on finishing in within a certain amount of time . <p> One necessary improvement was replacing all the peeling plaster inside the pool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Thankfully the tile was in really good condition , it has some film on it in some places but that 's a lot easier to treat than replacing the tile , something we dealt with last year with pool remodel #1 in the first Vegas house . ( That pool remodel was more costly it required removing a broken glass block wall , a new structural wall , and also brand new tile and plaster . ) <p> We hired the same company as we did last time and again they did a fantastic job . New plaster ( called " marcite " ) requires that the pool is emptied and the old plaster is removed all the way down to the gunite base . here 's a look at the spa once the plaster was removed and then after it was replaced . <p> A pool remodel is an expense , it cost several thousand dollars just to give it this facelift and replace the plaster but it adds so much value when it comes time to sell ( and it wont slow up the sale for those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are a few nice palms and bushes in the rear yard but we will add a few more before we sell . <p> This house has a great floor plan with transitional indoor/outdoor living because of the wide covered loggia that stretches the length of the house .

As I mentioned in my last post , I'm- off to Hawaii for a week before the fall semester begins and the kids go back to school . I 've written before about my Maui favorites and I 'm excited to revisit them again . Below are some favorite links for you ! <h> 15 comments <p> Your about you section says your a renovator , decorator , and doit yourselfer and I 've been following your blog for quite some time . I feel like lately your blog has become more about your privileged lifestyle of traveling the world than what people actually want to hear about . I not that different I live in the bay area , have traveled to most of the places you have so i 'm not saying privileged its bad . I 'm saying is not what most people want to read about ( maybe some , but not most ) . Maybe everyone in my boat has already left and I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback so you could consider your readers . <p> That 's a fair comment and certainly one opinion H. This blog is about what I like to write about and I 'm not tied to one particular topic . People do n't  decide what I write about . I do . I like to travel and I save up my money to do it because I find it fulfilling . Call it privileged if you like , I prefer to think about travel differently , as something to plan for and look forward to because it is eye opening and inspiring . I 'm sorry if those posts bore you , you 're free to unsubscribe at any time . If you stay you 'll benefit from my DIY and design and renovation posts that will be published from time to time , as I have done for nearly 8 years . <p> I agree with H. I used to love the creative ideas on this site , but I am increasingly disappointed that it has turned into an online vacation scrap book and a forum for endorsements . Like many of your readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you well , but I am moving on to other blogs . <p> H should speak for herself and not others . She has no idea what " most " of your readers prefer to read about . I enjoy getting my posts about whatever you 'd like to write about . It is inspiring , and the way you look at traveling the architecture , the textiles , the colors , the design .. Leaves me inspired about how to incorporate other cultural elements into my home , not just picking something up at World Market and calling it a collected home . Keep on keeping on girl ! ! p.s . I 'm from Petaluma and have traveled as well , and do n't  consider myself privileged : ) <p> I will have to check out those budget friendly wall mirrors as we are in the market for some new mirrors for our bedroom and bathrooms .

Have a wonderful trip to Maui Kate ! One of my favorite places . <p> Thank you Nicole . I agree , I think that individuality is key in blogging , I do n't  want to read a homogenized blog that looks like all the others . I want to read blogs that see things through the eyes of the writer and what is happening in their lives , and without passing judgment . I stay true to myself and write about what is happening in my corner of the world whether its design or DIY or travel . I appreciate your comment and your support . : ) 23102 @qwx883102

Yes , I do that , I sit down in a chair , cup my chin in my hand , look up to the ceiling , and think about microwave ovens . About their placement in kitchens and *gasp* even their necessity . <p> The microwave oven as we all know has become a staple in the American home in the last 40 years , they are the most convenient appliance for a quick reheat and in my experience , they make a great baked potato . I 've asked friends this question , " How often do you use your microwave ? " For some the answer is " several times a day " for others " not much at all " . <p> The reason Ive been thinking so much about them is that I 'm getting rid of the micro hood in our Nevada house were remodeling , at least temporarily , and for two reasons . First , its black , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While I endorse the two tone cabinetry look , I do prefer that the finishes on appliances are the same , so the range is getting replaced with a white slide in to complement the existing dishwasher and refrigerator ( not shown ) and the black microwave is leaving . Both the range and microwave hood will be sold on Craigslist or donated to Habitat , and the cabinets will eventually be replaced , but not until winter . <p> Second , I 'm not a huge fan of the micro hood . I do see its purpose in a smaller kitchen , it makes sense , but I do prefer the look of just a hood by itself above a range or cooktop and so I 'm seeking ways to include a microwave in the kitchens new design but I want to make it disappear , at least from prominent view . <p> In my search of inspiring ideas I found many clever ways to hide the microwave so that it is available when needed but also hidden from sight . <h> 86 comments <p> My husband and I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that sounds crazy , but our last house did n't  have one , we lived there for about 2 years and did n't  miss it(much) and the home we live in now has a very small kitchen , but we were already used to not having a microwave that we did n't  bother to buy one ! Someday I 'm sure it will be a necessary appliance , but for now we just kind of like surprising people when they notice we do n't  have one ! I will say , however , that the only time I REALLY miss it is when I need to melt butter for baking ! <p> Our microwave is over our cooktop . I do n't  like it there , but it was the concession we made when building our kitchen seven years ago . It just did n't  fit anywhere else conveniently or where DH and I could agree . I still think about remodeling our kitchen and where else it could go . The leading option is putting it on the island . DH still is n't sold on having it below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The problem with ours is that our cooktop is wider than our mic so the upper cabinets extend just a few inches over the cooktop , which is a ( small ) problem for putting spices and baking supplies in those cabinets . The steam and heat make a mess out of Crisco and coconut oil , and lessen the freshness of the spices . We just really need to redo that whole wall where our cooktop/mic/frig is . Someday . <p> We put ours inside one of our lower cabinets . We came from an apartment with basically no counter space , so when we moved into our home I wanted to enjoy as much counter space as possible ( we inherited just a hood over the stove ) . I 've noticed we use it much less this way , but it is still useful occasionally . Someday we may lose it completely , but for now I love it out of sight . <p> We do not use our microwave that much . We redid our kitchen 2 years ago and I put ours in the pantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not love the look of it always out . It was really one of my better ideas . I actually use our toaster oven more and I even created a pull out shelt to hide it in the kitchen . <p> We were lucky enough to have room for a walk-in pantry in our new home so that 's where the microwave lives . We could not live without it and that 's a great solution for us as I do n't  like them visible . <p> When we built our home I had the electrician add an electrical outlet to the pantry so that I could keep the microwave out of sight . The pantry has a long counter that holds the microwave , toaster oven , food processor with shelving above for canned goods . <p> Our microwave broke 5 or so years ago and we never replaced it . I can safely say I have n't missed it except for a quick bag of popcorn . But then again , I 've read microwave popcorn is n't good for you so I guess we are doing ourselves a favor : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a triple stack of microwave/convection oven , convection oven and warming drawer . Ill have to give up a drawer under the ovens for the warming drawer but I think it will be worth it . <p> We use our microwave all the time and couldnt do without one . Ours is out in the open right now ( and taking up a lot of counterspace ! ) that I wish I could use for something else , but there is no where else to put it . In our next house we are currently in the design phase I plan on getting a microwave drawer . That will keep it off the counter , but still close by . <p> Our microwave migrated from the kitchen counter to the counter in the butlers pantry , just thru a doorway arch from the kitchen . I love having it there out of the way ! Microwaves are useful , but they will never be mistaken for kitchen jewelry . Cass <p> We got rid of our microwave in 2008 and havent looked back ! We actually eat better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microwaved . It was tough those first few months , but we honestly have no intention of ever owning one again . Good luck ! Ca n't wait to see the kitchen ! <p> I had the same issue when we renovated our kitchen . There was no place to hide it behind a cupboard so we ended up putting a microwave drawer in our island . I was n't sure if I would like the drawer , but so far I love it . You push a button and it slides open . It is more expensive than a regular microwave , but it was the best fit for our kitchen ! <p> I havent had a microwave for 10 years , and have never missed it . I just heat things up on the stovetop or in the oven . It takes just a bit longer , but food usually reheats better . I really appreciate not having to dedicate cabinet or counter space to another appliance ! <p> I would love to have my microwave concealed , but I worry about what the heat/steam venting will do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , but I heated a stouffers lasagna ( the bigger ones ) in there one time and things were not good . All of the steam vented out the side as it was supposed to but then went up INTO my wall cabinets and formed condensation on the dishes . Totally blew my mind . <p> Let me start by saying we do n't  use our microwave much a couple times a week maybe . We use to have our microwave above our stove . A few years ago we did a kitchen remodel and purchased a new in cabinet microwave . It is built into our island and has a pull down door similar to an oven . Our designer also mentioned having a microwave in an upper cabinet ( or above the stove ) poses a burn risk especially to children and older adults . Example pulling down a hot cup of boiling water for hot chocolate or reaching up to the microwave and touching the hot stove but with everything in the kitchen , there are risks : ) I do like the look of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated our kitchen two years ago , we took out the micro/hood over the stove and put a microwave in the upper cabinet next to it . All of the upper cabinets are 15 inches deep , which made it pretty easy to fit the microwave inside . I love that the microwave is n't the first thing we see when we walk into the kitchen anymore ! We leave the cabinet doors open when we use the mw and havent had any problems with the ventilation . I wish I had thought of putting retractable doors on that cabinet , though . <p> Yes ! I can live without a microwave and we did for 9 months when our micro hood broke and then my husband just could not stand it any longer . I have decided I hate micro hoods because of canning . They just do n't  leave enough space above the stovetop . I ended up installing a shelf in our pantry and buying a small $50 microwave that fit perfectly . <p> We are also microwave " less . We got rid of our microwave over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have a toaster oven for reheating just so we do n't  have to heat up the whole kitchen for a small meal . I enjoy the novelty of using the microwave the other peoples homes , but do n't  miss having one in my house at all <p> We do n't  have a microwave either ; and I do n't  think we 'd use it that much if we did have one . We do n't  often have leftovers because we always found that they would just go to waste . So , we just learned to plan accordingly and cook just enough for one meal . If , for example , we do have any leftovers , we like use the vegetables in a quiche or use the meat in tacos or a soup . I really like the appliance pantry , however , and would love to incorporate it in our ( someday ) kitchen remodel ! <p> Mines in the pantry . I bought the house new and had the builder put an outlet in there specifically so that I could put it out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleeker hood just feels so good ! ! <p> We went through a major kitchen remodel last year , and went with a drawer microwave . It is amazing and I would never go back to any other kind again . It opens with the push of a button , and makes it much easier/safer to lift out hot items , or stir something halfway through . It also keeps it out of the way , and becuase it is built in , has a very sleek look . We love it ! <p> When we designed our kitchen I opted for more storage/drawer space over finding a spot for the microwave . Its in our laundry/pantry and when we build that out it will go in a bottom cabinet without doors . We really do n't  use the microwave except for the occasional heating up leftovers or defrosting a bagel straight out of the freezer . It may not be appealing for other people whenever we decide to sale the house and move but that was n't a big enough excuse for me to include it in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microwave that is also an oven . Truth is , we do n't  use the microwave part very much , but doubling as a mini convection oven , its what we use the most in our kitchen . We use it almost every day . For baking , cooking , re-heating . It heats up in less than 10 minutes . And it looks more like an oven . In my next kitchen I would do double mini ovens and only one large oven instead of what we have now : a regular double oven ( which we use almost never ) and this mini oven . <p> I hate when they are above the stove and I get scalded from steam when stirring big pots . When I remodeled my kitchen there was n't a good spot for it so I did n't  put it in the kitchen . The small vintage sewing tables ( they have a top board that flips open and the machine rotates up ) are the perfect size . Mine sat in the dining room for a while . I moved it to the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . I use it less than once a week , so its not inconvenient at all . I plan to have a special buffet built to fit it and look nice , but I have n't gotten there yet . <p> We are looking into a steam oven since most of what we reheat are leftovers . But we are thinking about either a drawer microwave or hiding a microwave in a cabinet or pantry for things like popcorn and things than ca n't be reheated by steam . <p> I would prefer to have it hidden . I would prefer to have my Kitchaide mixer hidden . Those two things will happen when we redo our kitchen . Currently we do n't  have anything that will hold the mixer and a plugs not convenient to any cabinet that would hold our microwave . I 'm not a fan of the built-in microwave because when you need to replace it , its a pain finding one the correct size . Ca n't wait to see what you end up with in the microwave department . <p> We moved into our new house last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be seen in my new kitchen so we put ours in the pantry . My husband was convinced I was insane but its worked out well and we love it in there . Our toaster and other small appliances are also in there . Handy but tucked out of sight . : ) <p> We tossed our microwave around 3 years ago , and never regretted it . But before that , we had the microwave in many locations in the kitchen : the range hood combo , counter top , within a base cabinet , atop a free standing table , on and on . I 'd have to say the most convenient is still sitting on the counter . Not the most attractive however . <p> We chucked our microwave five years ago and have not looked back . We were only using it to make popcorn and now we just pop corn on the stove topso much tastier and healthier for you . We were shocked to learn that microwaves has been banned in some countries . Food for thought <p> When we redid our kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . We had an old ( and gigantic , but use what you have , right ? ) Sharp Carousel that we pulled out of storage and set on top of a freestanding cabinet unit . Its in plain sight , and its huge : two things I do n't  prefer , but both are far , far better than the old one above the stove . <p> My main recommendation would be to make sure the microwave is easy for your kids to access . My youngest can make popcorn by himself , which is awesome , and I would not want anything to get in the way of him being able to do that . If you were to hide yours behind a door , I 'd just make sure its easy to open all the way so that the microwave door did n't  ram the cabinet door by less-than-careful users . : ) <p> i think that the main function of microwave is to have quickly something hot , and that 's why i think the best thing is to have access quickly to to the microwave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i need just to choose the good design to be beautiful in my kitchen , to have a beautiful color and design to be good in the decoration in my kitchen . you can have a beautiful kitchen with full and quick access today ! <p> My husband and I ditched our microwave back in 2008 and havent missed it at all . Like the poster above , we make our popcorn on the stove top ( thanks , whirley pop ! ) and it is much , much tastier ! Sometime I wish I could cook a potato quickly , but not enough to even think about getting a microwave . <p> I am so surprised to see many others commenting that they do n't  have microwaves . My husband and I got rid of ours in 2006 when we were still dating , because research out of the EU shows they alter food at the molecular level ( also interesting- they gave someone a blood transfusion with blood that had been microwaved to the proper temperature , and it promptly killed the patient ) . I 've NEVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so glad to know we are n't  the only family . We use a toaster oven for most of our reheating , and that poses some of the same design dilemmas . We bought one in the same color as our appliances ( black ) and it sits on a shelf fully exposed . <p> I have thought of several areas my microwave could go because I really want a wood vent hood , but I still havent done it . The biggest reason is my microwave is also a convection oven and made to go over a stovetop . I really need that second oven because our new wall oven ( GE ) has been a lemon . I really need two ovens since we host a lot of parties . <p> I absolutely use my microwave everyday . I cant wait to see the reveal . I 'm glad to hear you 're going with white appliances . Its weird that white is now different with everyones obsession with stainless . I 'm curious to know what you decide for your hardware . I just recently did a post on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estee had quite an influence on her design aesthetic . <p> We have a tiny kitchen with very limited counter space . A few years ago , we put our microwave in a hutch that we had put in an awkward part of the kitchen to add more storage . We use it almost daily , but I love that we were able to reclaim some counter space . <p> Great post , Kate . I 'm with you that I do n't  love seeing the microwave ( ours currently sits on the counter ) . I like the hidden behind cabinet doors or pantry options . Over the stove just seems really inconvenient to me . Under the counter is great because you cant see it , but I feel like it also might not be the most convenient being so low down . Ill definitely be referring back to this post when we finally are able to do our kitchen renovation . Thanks . <p> I just moved mine off the counter and under our island top . It took my family a few days to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tried to do without one but we missed it after a while . A necessary evil in our house . <p> We were VERY close to putting ours in the pantry because I was adamant it not be above the range when we built our house . At the last minute , we ended up adding in wall oven with a microwave built into the same wall unit . So its still in view but completely built in . I was thrilled with our last minute decision ! <p> Youve got to get a GE Advantium ! Worlds Greatest Applianceever . Well , almost . That bread slicer was pretty awesome . ; ) This is my second one . ( Second kitchen ) I could n't live without it . It looks like a small wall oven . It is a speed cooker ( amazing ) , convection oven , toaster , broiler , AND microwave all in one nice , neat package . Its all you 'll ever use . You can get a peek in my kitchen remodel post . <p> We needed to have ours within reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a bit more self-sufficient in the kitchen . There was n't a great place to put it that was low enough in the cabinetry when we re-did the kitchen this past fall , so we got a nice-enough-looking one and just put it on the counter . No regrets . <p> As an Australian , I 've never seen the microwave hood . Most houses I vist have the microwave on the benchtop . When we built our house , we had a space built into the island bench ( similar to your under counter picture ) and it works perfectly . <p> The microwave door has a stainless steel finish and a mirrored door so it matches well with the oven . ( Pure accident since I have had the microwave for over 10 years ) It is a crisp and grill version so in my single days I used it everyday . Now that Im married however , I mostly use it for defrosting meat . <p> I built a cabinet using the bottom half of a dresser . It sits above a drawer with a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painted it to match my cabinets . Its perfect against the empty wall next to my pantry and fridge ! <p> My microwave is built into the wall next to my double ovens . This means I do n't  have to worry about it taking up space , but replacing it when it died reduced my choices . My moms is hidden in a lower cabinet , and I have had some awkward moments getting very hot things out while crouched over . If its hidden , I would put it at least at counter height . <p> I thought I did n't  use a microwave much and wasnt in any hurry to replace it when it broke . After just a couple of weeks it was driving me crazy and I had to go on a quest to find one that would fit in the spot ! I almost never use it for cooking , but we use it ALL THE TIME for reheating leftovers . I regularly cook a little extra for dinner , and my family has been well trained to eat the leftovers . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toaster oven , but the extra dishes and energy that used was a deterrent . I found myself spending more on sandwich supplies and throwing away more food than usual . The new microwave was definitely worth it for our family . <p> We use the microwave many times each day for cooking and would have a hard time doing without it . I have a large countertop unit made for cooking that I really like . BUT in our recent kitchen remodel we sacrificed it for a microwave/hood unit over the stove so we could have more storage space . I love the additional storage space but I hate the microwave over the stove even more than I thought I would . It is too high for short me to reach easily but much closer to the stove than a simple range hood . I have a gas range so I need to make sure the burner is turned off when I reach up or I 'm afraid ( maybe not realistically lol ) that I will catch my shirt on fire . I do n't  like the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , the biggest problem is that an overstove microwave is made for warming and not cooking . The ones I found all had presets for heating beverages or prepackaged foods but not enough flexibility to easily handle cooking even simple things like melting butter . The old microwave now rests on the buffet in the dining room and still gets more use than the one over the stove ! If I were to do things over ( and we just finished the remodel ! ) I probably would build the more useful microwave into the storage unit . <p> We could n't live without a microwave , we have a fancy coffee maker ( grinds the beans and all ) but it is never hot enough for me so it gets used many times a day ! We also use it to reheat left overs and cook vegetables . In the remodel we are about to undertake the microwave will not be in a cupboard or on the bench . It will either be in a stack with the wall oven or on shelf with the upper cabinets . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous reaching down to pick up hot dishes . Currently it is on the bench and taking up way too much real estate ! <p> We removed our microwave from our kitchen over 5 years ago . We moved it into the basement for 6 months if we needed it , it would still be in the house . We never used it once , so we sold it and have never looked back . Unlike some of the other comments , not having it encouraged us to eat more whole food and cook only what we needed for that meal . When we do have leftovers they are easily reheated on the stove/oven . And , I love the extra counter/cabinet space ! ! <p> I have my microwave hidden inside a floor to ceiling built in pantry , sitting on one of the shelves . We did n't  intend for it to be there , as it was suppossed to be exposed and built in beneath the counter . But when the contractors started building the kitchen they said it would n't fit under the counter so we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ) or placed on the shelf inside the built in pantry since there was an electrical outlet . So it haphazarly found its home inside the hidden pantry , and I absolutely love it ! <p> The best way to really hide a microwave is a microwave drawer . This idea serves several purpose , as quita a few of the pictures shown above actually violate manufactures specification for proper air flow around a microwave . This does become a fire hazard as well as a warranty issue . Remember to check the specs first . <p> As a certified Kitchen and Bath Designer , I 'm with Heather . My clients that install the microwave drawer absolutely love it ! The OTR micro hood is my last resort for a microwave installation . Not only is is not particularly attractive , if you are shorter in stature , the ergonomics of reaching up above shoulder level to pull a hot dish out could be dangerous if it was tipped the wrong way . If it is installed inside of a cabinet , venting should be a consideration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Due to space limitations and the fact that I rarely use a microwave , we actually put ours in the basement kitchen . I 'm actually considering giving it away when we move . We have discovered that reheating things on the stove does n't  take much longer and usually it looks and tastes much better . I 've noticed that Martha Stewart does n't  microwave anythingor maybe she just has hers put away like you 've suggested here . ; ) If I were to keep a microwave , I think most of the options you shared would be terrific . Especially those that are counter level for children and preventing accidents . <p> Function before form . Personally , I do n't  want to open cabinet doors to access the mwave an extra step added that detracts from the convenience . Plus , those doors are always hanging open . Its an appliancea large one . It is n't a toaster or mixer . Most families that use their mwave , use it often . It should be easily accessed . My townhome cooktop came w a vent/microwavewould I have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no other place to put it in this layout . Another great option is a below-counter microwave drawer . My neighbor put one in his very glam kitchen and loves it ! Its handy , accessible , good-looking and functionala conversation piece , in fact . <p> I 'm also in the no microwave category . My husband and I moved from a house with a built in one to a house with none . We kept saying , " we need to buy a microwave . " Well , two years later and we still have n't , who needs one ? ! <p> I love these inspirations , but sadly we do n't  really have an upper cabinet that will work , and I think putting it in a lower cabinet might be awkward sometimes . I 've seen them placed in pantries though , and I think they work well there . Love the idea of an appliance pantry . Good luck with everything in the house ! Ca n't wait to see what you do ! <p> I just purchased a new built in microwave , not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of a fan hood was equal to or more than a microwave . I think that when it comes time to sell ( in a few years ) that a built in microwave will be a selling point over a fan hood . I believe that the microwave alters the food molecules and make it unsafe to consume . <p> We recently stopped using ours and are reheating food on the stove or our Breville Smart Oven . We moved into a new build a few months ago and I seem to remember asking about an outlet in the pantry and was told that it is against code ( or was it on a tv show or online ? ) . Anyway , we do not have an outlet inside the walk in pantry so the microwave is still there only unplugged . <p> We do not usually make popcorn , or buy microwavable meals , so all we used it for was reheating food . <p> Our Breville oven is another story , it is the most used appliance we have and worth every cent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the stove . Ive been looking into going to the company who supplied the kitchen cabinets to our builder and adding an appliance garage for it , one like this one <p> When we remodeled our kitchen my husband built ( to my specification ) two armoire type cabinets that sit on top of the granite of our lower cabinets . Both " cabinets " have double bi-fold doors so they open wide and fold back . One cabinet holds the kitchenaide mixer , food processor and food saver , the other holds the microwave , coffee maker and toaster oven . Electrical outlets are inside both cabinets . Everything is out of sight when the doors are closed , but easily accessible . My husband added pretty plate storage to each side of one of the cabinets to break up the look . Love the clean look ! <p> I 've never replied to one of your blog posts , but I felt compelled this time because I 've been writing this same post in my head for months ! I lie awake at night and google images on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I need to find a smaller microwave to hide , for it to work in our house . Best wishes with yours ! ! <p> I keep ours easy access and I do n't  mind the look of our microwave but our kitchen has a lot of counter space . I really liked the look of the appliance cabinets you posted that have doors that push to the side so that you have the option to leave them open . I would like a little station with my blender and coffee maker all in one , but I probably would just close it when having guests over . Our microwave is used very often for melting butter , coconut oil and reheating any leftovers that are conducive to this method . <p> I bought Kitchen-aid appliances , and the microwave functions as a 2nd convection oven in addition to the microwave , so the oven stack is the microwave/oven/warming drawer . That warming drawer is the winner . I serves as a slow-cooker . I love the look of the stainless and black against the " furniture look " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who go without . I guess during the week , I 'm too much a heatngo girl . <p> Ours is in our pantry ! Had them run an outlet when we did the remodel ! We only use it to melt butter , soften ice cream , Pop popcorn and heat up left overs ; so I found no reason to have it visible in my kitchen ! I 'm with you Kate ! <p> Ours died six months ago , so we decided to just go without , and it opened up 1/4 of the countertop space in our kitchen ! ( Our kitchen is TINY ) . We have n't really missed it much . We reheat things on the stovetop , and , very occasionally , in the oven . The only time I really miss it is when my coffee gets cold and it takes me 2 minutes to reheat it on the stovetop instead of zapping it for 20 seconds in the microwave . <p> I havent had a microwave in 9 years and Ive never missed it . Sure I have to plan a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reheating but I cant imagine ever having another one in my home . However , for renters.its like a dishwasher , expected . Although I have n't had a dishwasher for 3 years and do n't  miss it either . <p> We have been microwave-free for about 5 years now . When we bought our house , which has a fairly small kitchen , I searched high and low for a compact microwave that was powerful , had a small footprint but was big enough to hold our dinner plates , and had good reviews . We found one , purchased it and 8 months later it stopped working . I called the manufacturer and they said it was out of warranty . I was so mad that I told my husband to throw it away and I refused to buy a new one . Honestly , we do n't  miss it . I like having the extra counter space and I think there have only been a few times in 5 years that I thought it would be nice to have one . Mostly we bring leftovers to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove or in the oven . Microwaves are really not necessary . 23102 @qwx883102

I 'm making some final design choices for the flip house in the next few days and buying all the appliances because of the big weekend sales .

College friends are the best ! <p> Memorial Day Weekend is always the kickoff for summer and it could n't come fast enough for me this year because of all the rain we had in California .

@@99057564 @3257564/ <h> Casual Dining Chair Favorites <p> By Kate Riley August 16 , 2016 <p> Yesterday on the airplane ride home I was feeling rested and inspired . Taking a vacation has that effect : ) I came up with a long To Do list of things I want to accomplish around the house this fall . Funny how when you live with so little while traveling you realize you really do n't  need so much stuff in your home , just a few favorite functional and pretty pieces to make it feel comfortable and happy . <p> Some of my rugs and furnishings are a little worn , so I 'll be replacing them with a few new things this season . My dining room chair slipcovers are the perfect example , I have four of the Ballard Designs parsons style chairs in my dining room . Theyve worked so well for our family for years I 'm sticking with that style , just replacing the slipcovers with new fabric . <p> It brought to mind a few favorite styles of dining room chairs that always look chic in a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs that will always look great ! <h> Parsons <p> Simple and streamlined , a parsons style dining chair is a classic . Whether slipcovered or upholstered , the look is tailored and timeless . <h> Wishbone <p> I also have two wishbone chairs in my home , they live in corners as accents but come in handy when I need extra seating when people visit . Wishbone chairs have a unique look with their smooth rounded back support and rattan seat , they are simple- and- modern . <p> Of course you never need to match all of your dining chairs , a mixed group always looks chic and inviting ! What style of chair do you have in your dining room ? Do you love the style , or would you trade them in for something different ? <h> 7 comments <p> A few years ago , when I was looking for new chairs for my breakfast room , I found 6 bentwood and woven cane Thonet style chairs at a used furniture store . They 're definitely my all-time favorite dining chairs . They 're light weight , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I made custom seat pads ) , and I love the look of them . <p> I just sold my dining table and chairs that I had for years as I was ready for a chairs . Thanks for the inspiration with this post . I think I am going to go with the Paige chairs at World Market and I 'm still deciding on a table . <p> Both sets of blue Chinese Chippendale are beautiful . I can imagine them in both casual and more formal settings , and being able to see through them helps a space to feel open and airy . Inserting a different chair at either end of the table as in the last image is visually interesting , and somewhat unexpected in a space that has n't  been professionally designed . I would love the banquet with the Saarinen oval dining table paired with Bertoia chairs . Swoon ! Thank you for the beautiful AND interesting images ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057565 @3257565/ <h> Spotlight : Rita Chan Interiors <p> By Kate Riley September 7 , 2016 <p> Whenever I discover an impressive designer portfolio , especially one that is new to me , I like to send the designer a note on his or her beautiful work . I discovered Rita Chan Interiors a few weeks ago and had to reach out . Rita went to school for Interior Architecture at UCLA and worked for Waterleaf Interiors in Manhattan Beach for a few years before establishing her own design firm . <p> I loved the casual coastal vibe of so many of her interiors ! Rita was kind enough to answer a few questions , ones I find helpful for anyone decorating their own spaces . <p> 1 . You believe in creating a peaceful environment at home that makes every day feel like a vacation . Tell us why that 's important and how it affects your approach to design . <p> In today 's incredibly fast paced world it 's so easy to get overstimulated , overbooked and stressed out , so I think it 's more important than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give our minds a real break from all the noise . My goal when designing homes is to evoke that sense of being on an amazing vacation , where we truly unwind , allow ourselves to be present and enjoy life and our loved ones . <p> - <p> For many , vacations and travel are the happiest times we have , so why not have those feelings everyday ? I think our surrounding environment can really affect the way we feel , whether we realize it or not , so when I am designing I am not just thinking about how something will look , but how it will make my client feel . I am all about helping them to feel relaxed , calm and happy . <p> - <p> - <p> 2 . What tricks do you use to warm up a home with all white kitchens or walls ? <p> I like to warm up all white kitchens by bringing in natural elements such as wooden shelves , wooden bowls and cutting boards , rattan trays , potted plants , displays of fruit and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to add warmth and personality are through window treatments , such as patterned or textured roman shades . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 3 . What 's a good tip for decorating a space with a leather sofa ? <p> For a leather sofa I like pillows with a heavier texture or a more worn look , so vintage pillows are always a good call on leather . Since most leather sofas tend to demand attention , I like to keep everything else in the room pretty light and neutral and allow for the sofa to be the center of attention . <p> - <p> - <p> 4 . What are your favorite ways to add texture to a room ? <p> My favorite ways to add texture into a room are through woven upholstery fabrics , and natural materials such as raffia , rattan , jute or sisal rugs , and grasscloth wallpaper I think my very favorite texture is a patterned grasscloth paper . <p> - <p> - <p> 5 ) What advice can you share for those who like the idea of wallpaper but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I always recommend saving bold wallpaper for the less frequented rooms such as the powder and laundry rooms , playrooms or guest bedrooms . If you are interested in wallpaper for the shared living spaces or main bedrooms I typically think grasscloth or a very subtle and neutral patterned wallpaper is the way to go . <p> Her coastal vibe does suit me well . I like the idea of making home become a peaceful place . You do n't  need to go on vacation quite often , when staying at home can relax you physically and mentally .

This week I 'm focusing on the little details that remain , hanging the art , installing the new chandelier , and layering a few decorative accessories . Another project I 'm also working on is the window treatments with- some help from The Shade Store , one of the sponsors of this One Room Challenge . <p> My favorite style of window treatment is a layered one- that includes- woven shades to add texture and control light paired with fabric panels on top for softness or pattern . One challenge I have in my master bedroom is that the big window faces the street where there is a very bright street light 30 feet away . It happens to be the wall I turn towards when I sleep so that light shines right into my room . I 've wanted a light blocking privacy lined shade there for so long and now it 's on its way ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , I ordered four free samples in the colorway I wanted and they arrived from the Shade Store in just a few days with a lovely catalog to browse . <p> - <p> I opted for the woven shade material in the top right corner since I liked its texture and color best . <p> - <p> The Shade Store offers a lot of different options for window treatments on their site , from woven shades to roman shades to custom fabric panels . I like that their products are all made in the USA ! <p> Once I knew which material I wanted it was easy to customize the shades with their online tool . Of course they also offer professional measurement services from their showrooms across the nation if you 're uncomfortable making precise measurements yourself . <p> - <p> For my fabric panels that layer on top of these shades , I found DKNY pale gray cotton velvet panels at HomeGoods to hang on brass rods and rings . ( I 'll share sources next week ) . The final window treatments for the bedroom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton velvet panels layered on top . <p> - <p> I always tweak store bought panels by sewing cotton liner to the back , for several reasons . First , I think lined panels look better from the outdoors when all you see is white , so they 're more professional looking . ( Unless you 're using sheers as decorative panels , then liner defeats the purpose ! ) I also like that liner makes a curtain heavier so it drapes better . I purchase $5/yard liner from a local fabric store and attach it to the back of a curtain with- thread that matches my fabric panel . Note , you can also buy room darkening liner to turn any store bought panel into one that blocks light . <p> - <p> Finally , a- really nice perk from sewing liner to the back is it allows you to hide the clip so when you 're using store bought rings you ca n't see the clip that holds the fabric from the front , it 's hidden , this I love ! <p> - <p> Only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time to get excited ! See what 's happening with my fellow participants in the One Room Challenge as they get their spaces ready too ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057569 @3257569/ <h> Decorating with Coral ! <p> By Kate Riley July 16 , 2013 <p> Continuing the Color Inspiration Series today with a look at one of my favorites , perhaps yours too , the very in vogue shade of coral . It 's been hot this spring and summer in fashion and decor , and is such a happy hue that is part pink part orange . Many people consider coral a feminine shade but I think just like pink that energetic coral is very balanced when partnered with black , navy , or rich wood tones . <p> Coral is the color of the sky at sunrise and sunset , casting a warm glow over the ocean and earth . It 's a perfect paint color in a bedroom , I love it mixed with aqua and modern white accents , very fresh ! <p> I have a design crush on coral textiles , big bold florals and geometrics too . Coral is warm and youthful and it looks amazing with warmer metals like brass and gold , or paired with darker neutrals like mocha , charcoal gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint can be tricky , it can lean salmon or orange or pink depending on the light in a space and its location in the home . I chose Begonia ' by Sherwin Williams for my studio wall . Have you painted anything coral lately ? What shade would you recommend ? <p> I am loving the coral trend ! I really like that it is less of the peachy-coral of the 80s but more of a bold color that can lean pink , red , or orange . I went with Sherwin Willians Rejuvenate in our otherwise carrara marble and white bathroom and really love it ( I think it is the same color used on the picture frame pic , above ) . It is bright , leans toward orange , but just says " happy " ! <p> I 've found your blog not too long ago and I 've been following you since . I 'm in total sintony with youeven from the other side of the ocean ( from Portugal ) . <p> I love coral . I have a new house to decorate and for my daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it .

Youve been a huge inspiration as I 've gotten into DIY over the last few years , and for my thoughts about what design can do to make peoples lives better ( Alma Project , etc ) . <p> I am so glad you 've brought up coral . I am obsessed with the color so much , its basically the theme of my website . All the photos are fantastic Kate . Thank you so much for sharing ! And oh , I have lots of DIY that have not been on this website yet , will share with you later . Thanks again ! <p> I 've loved having coral in my wardrobe , its a color that looks good on everyone .

Needless to say , peer pressure prevailed and a coat of primer and beige later everyone but me were happy again . Only saving grace was the home later sold in a day . People in WA state sure do love their neutrals : ) <p> I loved this post ! I am currently in the process of decorating our office with coral as well as using accents of coral throughout the house !

So many projects so little time <p> I love the coral on the painted furniture and accent pieces . I 'm thinking about painting my daughters night stand or desk coralwould it be too much to do both ? The whole rooms painted coral felt overwhelmingI prefer something more calming like pale blue/aqua or white . <p> Ive been so drawn to coral the last few years . I absolutely love it .

Yikes ! <p> My wife wants that " Live Laugh Decorate " for our bedroom renovation . I unhesitatingly said yes to her . She is just so happy when I agreed . Is that orange or pink painted on the cabinet with lampshade on it ? <p> Its amazing how versatile coral is ! The top two images almost look Mediterranean , I love the warm global feel . I have lots of coral in my living room ( including a two-foot tall Flamingo ) and I 've mixed it with mustard and turquoise as awful as that sounds , it works really well and is quite retro ! 23102 @qwx883102

Oh , another tip cheapest place for pillow forms for euro shams is definitely Ikea . <p> My daughter shopped her sorority sisters who were seniors and leaving town the year she moved off campus . Lots of bargins to be had , no one wanted to bother moving all that furniture home . Love your choices ! <p> College was only a few years ago for me , and I 'm feeling reminiscent !

We splurged on a beautiful new mirror for above her desk so that its a combination study center and vanity . Also I 'm surprising her with her favorite headboard , the Moroccan from West Elm we both love it ! She will have a few nice things that will remain hers for years to come . Kate <p> Dd is leaving next week for her second year . This year she is in the brand new dorms so she will have her own room .

Love the first comforter where is it from ? Hope she has a wonderful college yr . <p> My oldest is heading to college for the first time . I have shopped the house for many items , and Ikea for bedding/baskets and organizational items . Also Costco has great prices for towels that are thick and luxurious ! . A friend who owns Urbanwall Decals **25;281;TOOLONG has made us a custom sized chalkboard decals for her walls since we cant nail or tape anything to the wall ! <p> It warms my heart when I hear of wonderful step moms , because I had a horrible stepmom that ruined my childhood .

I have three sons and all are going to college in the fall , two ( my twins ) are starting their third year and my youngest his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Minnesota . All he brought was a suitcase of cloths and will be getting what he needs there . Ive been sending boxes of necessities and cant wait to see how he " decorates " ! <p> If the student is staying in a dorm room , they 're usually very tiny . The bed is the largest piece of furniture , and is where *everyone* will sit . Plan on a bedspread that 's cute , but not too delicate , and can be washed . They really take a beating ! <p> Curtains , wall art , additional lighting , and a large durable carpet make the biggest impact . Anything else that is n't for organization just takes up valuable space . Desks and dressers are usually provided by the school . <p> I loved back to school shopping sigh . I miss college days . Luckly the school I went to ( Illinois State ) , the apartments came furnised with large furniture so we never to worry about buying a sofa , bed , desks , end tables . <p> I clicked on the Medallions spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed I could take a chance but hand wash a duvet ? Pretty to look at but I guess not a great choice for me to live with . I was surprised . <p> We have been shopping the discount stores for month and found some great items .

They really do n't  want a lot of " stuff " just the necessities , so for the most part we get whatever is cheap so that they can just give it to a friend when they graduate . The one thing I insisted on though was a good size desk and a good chair and nice bedding . Those we got at The Company Store , Staples , Office Depot ( free delivery ) , and Ikea . <p> I loved your postSo timely ! We just finished my sons first room in his own house ( house with friends anyway ) . He moved out of the dorms from last year and now its a whole new ball game . With 5 kids , were on a tight budget . So we did a lot of garage sale finds and turned them into cool pieces . But just like you , splurged on West Elm bedding and a shag rug . I was going to post some before and afters to show you like our $5 nightstand and $3 chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing the blog thing for a couple of months and not sure of the etiquette .

@@99057571 @3257571/ <h> 10 Kitchen Trends Here to Stay <p> By Kate Riley January 7 , 2014 <p> I have kitchens on my mind a lot these days and I 'm pinning dozens as I round up ideas for the future and of all the spaces in a home , kitchens prove the most challenging because the cabinet , tile , and surface choices are far more permanent . <p> The kitchen is where we cook and bake , and spend time with family and friends . It must stand up to daily wear and tear , moisture , heat , and the march of time when it comes to design trends . In the past few years , many trends are proving they have staying power , here 's a glance at ten looks that are defining modern kitchen design . <p> Open Shelving. - This bistro style has surged in popularity over the past few years and while many have questioned whether its timeless ( including me ) - it 's a look that so many of us embrace now and ranks high on many a homeowner 's list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within easy reach . <p> Two Color Cabinetry. - It used to be two separate colors between the island and surrounding cabinets , but now the two color cabinetry look is different . Now the two tone look is above and below . Choosing lighter cabinets above gives the illusion of less weight while the darker color on the base cabinets feels grounded . This is a modern and stylish way to mix tones , and one way to give an older single color kitchen a new look . <p> Tile to the Ceiling . This is my favorite look in kitchens , those feature walls of tile that go straight up to the ceiling and/or wrap around windows . Yep , it 's an added expense and unnecessary for function beyond the back of a range and the few inches needed above the counter but wow , what a statement it makes , right ? <p> Wood Countertops . They 're a higher maintenance surface , but offer a warmth that granite or marble ca n't provide . Have your wood countertops custom made by a local maker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like IKEA and easy to install without professional help . <p> Recycled &amp; Reclaimed Materials. - Compared to the generations of the past , we 're fortunate to have so many choices of eco-friendly materials including recycled glass tiles and countertops , cork and bamboo floors and reclaimed wood , all at the top of the list for many considering a remodel . <p> Neutral Painted Cabinets . Gray , greige , taupe , and gray greens offer a nice change to the stark white kitchens we 've love but have seen over and over the slightly warmer yet neutral hues feel elegant and refined . <p> Contemporary Wood Fronts . The warmth of wood is returning to the kitchen scene as many designers are including cherry , maple , and walnut woods . The door and drawer fronts are streamlined with no raised or beveled paneling and partnered with modern pulls for contemporary appeal . <p> Less or No Upper Cabinets . So many are now opting out of bulky upper cabinets and instead choosing the beauty of just windows or feature tile . What they sacrifice in storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look requires architectural consideration from the beginning of a kitchen 's design . <p> IKEA Cabinets. - IKEA is giving every kitchen cabinet manufacturer serious competition with their streamlined styles and lower prices . Anyone who has ever walked through the IKEA kitchens in stores knows that there are several styles and finishes to choose from , all of them making a kitchen remodel that much more affordable . <h> 65 comments <p> I think they are trends for a reason , I 'm sure well see something fresh and different again in the coming years . I would n't mind the tile to the ceiling look to stick around . I 'd love to do this in my kitchen . I 'd also like to paint my cabinets a neutral tone . <p> I am a fan of the 2 color cabinetry , tile to the ceiling and brass fixtures and I incorporated them when I renovated my kitchen . Definitely all your suggestions are here to stay , but will just depend on the persons taste and style . Open shelving is super trendy and pretty but its not for me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , LOL ! Less cabinets I would love , if I live in a huge house with a huge kitchen , practicality considered , I would still want a lot of them . : - ) Wood countertops definitely is beautiful but upkeep and voiding countertop warranty shunned me away from them , but for the island , I think its here to stay ! <p> My husband and I just demoed our kitchen this past weekend ! Were including more tile than a standard backsplash , antique brass pendant lights , and maybe adding in some open shelving when were done . I guess were more trendy than we thought ! I love the look of white cabinets , but alas he was n't game so were going with very dark maple cabinets . <p> Everything comes and goes . There are only three metal colors , silver , gold and bronze . Yellow gold is back in for jewelry and brass is back for fixtures . I 'm not a polished brass gal however I really like brushed brass ! Wallpaper has made a comeback also . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making or $$$$ ! <p> Great post ! I 'm in love with open shelving and want to do it so bad ! ! And I feel like it would be easy to add cabinets back if you grow tired of it ! Thanks for giving us some many inspirations ! Love your blog too ! ! <p> Oh my goodness the picture the fourth from the bottom with the white lower cabinets , a wall of windows and farmhouse sink has me in love ! ! ! My husband and I live in a small town with plans to someday move to a farm like he grew up on and that would without a doubt be my DREAM kitchen ! ! ! <p> I just discovered your blog and love it ! I like many of these kitchen trends except for the no upper cupboards and I think the open shelving looks lovely , but I 'd be concerned about dust and the shelves getting cluttered . <p> We have a kitchen reno planned for ( at least to start ) for this year , so good timing as I 'm beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large wall of windows behind the sink and tile around it up to the ceiling . Luckily we have a house this works aesthetically for inside and out and it is a DEFINITE . <p> 2 2 tone cabinets were thinking our full wall ( the " L ) will be all white and the island/peninsula will be a dark espresso wood tone . The darker cabinets seem like theyll hold up better to swinging feet from bar stools during meal times ! <p> 3 I have a huge question about cabinets if anyone has ANY feedback . We are definitely in the stock or semi-stock budget category . Does anyone have any feedback on Ikea cabinets that you 've had for maybe a year + and not just newly installed ? What about Shenandoah or other special order semi-custom types you can get at Lowes ? <p> @MichelleIve had ikea kitchen cupboards for 5 years in my kitchen in Paris . When we moved back to North America we took them with us and put them in the laundry room . They have held up wonderfully over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look new . HTH . <p> My favorite of these trends is definitely " tile to the ceiling " . This is always so captivating . Functional but sophisticated . <p> What 's interesting is that we have so many new materials to work with that the ideas seem to multiply faster now and we get a lot of micro-trends that do n't  necessarily have to define the entire kitchen design . <p> They can be combined or just a single idea added to an existing design to give it new life . Like removing upper cabinets to open the space or painting cabinets taupe to update an all white kitchen . <p> I also agree that laminate countertops can be a viable option . They are still a budget option but have taken a huge leap forward stylistically with new colors , patterns , and edge profiles . <p> I just finished a kitchen remodel about 3 months ago and went with IKEA cabinets . So far I LOVE them . I got lots of the extras pull out drawers and corner units so I have tons of storage packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counters I thought about lots of options and went with a very colorful solid surface by Formica . For my taste I like the glass front cabinets instead of open shelving . <p> I think the trends of two tone cabinetry and tile walls will age well . However I have serious doubts that brass will make a return . Most realtors in this area of the country ( Midwest ) suggest repainting or replacing it before you list a house built in the 80s to get a better price . I do think that the all white kitchens are going to fade , but they could easily be updated with the addtion of another color . <p> I love the open shelving ! I continue to take doors off in different houses we have lived in because i love it so much . And honestly , since I use the stuff on the shelves I do n't  have to dust very much . I like the neutral cabinets , but my first love is still white . Beachy , cottagy , sparkling white ! <p> Other than wood floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trend . The popularity of things like marble countertops and farm style sinks comes and goes , but those old standbys will always be there . <p> We recently updated our 80s-tastic kitchen with several of these " trends . " We painted our upper cabinets white , removed the upper cabinets over the kitchen peninsula to open it up , and painted our lower cabinets BM Amherst Gray . We sanded , stained , and installed ikea butcher block countertops and ADORE them . We stained horitzontal tongue and groove planks in gray for the front of the island . Some fabulous knobs and pulls finished off the look . It was a very affordable and satisfying renovation and has made our kitchen more liveable for our friends and family . <p> After recently switching out all of my brass hardware for nickle because " brass is out " ( something I have always loved ) Ive come to the conclusion that you should ignore the trends and make your home your own . Gray is the " it " color in home design but I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 30 years . I 've always considered it a neutral and have loved the color . In due time out will be in again which will confirm that you 've always had good taste regardless of what the pros think . Just do you ! <p> I LOVE LOVE LOVE two color cabinetry , wood countertops , and open shelving . @Ashley your new kitchen sounds exactly like what I want to have one day . Im having kitchen envy . <p> Also , I think its so funny that you ( @Kate ) listed " No Uppers " . I really had n't  come across that idea yet , but strangely enough , my boyfriend mentioned that he loved the concept the other day . I think we are going to have a kitchen compromise on our hands when we buy our first home ! = ) <p> I 'd love the idea of " less uppers " in a kitchen remodel too Jessica , especially in a smaller space where one might crave more storage but restraint makes the space feel less cramped . : ) I nixed the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here : LONG ... and it made ALL the difference . <p> After watching countless house programs , I could n't stand another I want granite countertops and stainless steel appliances . Taste and preferences are personal and I love to come into a kitchen where I can see people have made up their own mind on what 's nice or beautiful ! The more personal , the better , be it brass , stainless steel , wood , colors or white ! <p> This post could not of come at a better time . We are in the beginning stages of building a home , and trying to convince my hubby that not everything needs to be matchy matchy ! I am loving the look of mixing countertops and cabinetry finishes , but also do n't  want to be too trendy . I 'm hoping if I stick with the classics but give it a twist I will be okRIGHT ? ? <p> IKEA cabinets I have had mine for 5 years . I have three kids and a dog . I am not terribly careful . And we regularly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafts , and animals underfoot . In short , this is no show kitchen used only to warm up the take-out dinner . The IKEA cabinets are great ! They still look new . Still work like new ! ! <p> Open shelves Luv em in the homes of tidy , design savvy friends . Too much curating for me . I have frosted glass doors from IKEA . It breaks up the bland expanse of cabinets and makes even messy interiors look charming , interesting and colorful . <p> Gina , I still believe stainless appliances look good , to me stainless feels clean in a kitchen . I 'm also a huge fan of paneling an appliance if you can . I know its pricey but a paneled fridge or dishwasher breaks up all the stainless , that 's one solution , although it often requires a custom order . I 'm a lover of white appliances too , I think they 're clean and timeless , how can you go wrong with white ? <p> Perfect timing for two reasons : Weve been planning a kitchen remodel ( we , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then 2 weeks ago we suffered water damage in our kitchen through the range hood vent during a rain storm . The insurance adjuster was at our home today and said EVERY CABINET needs to go , the walls need to come out down to the studs , the bulkhead needs to go , lighting needs to be replaced , the flooring probably needs to be replaced because we have hardwood and it buckled where it got wet , and more . We thought it was going to be about $500 damage which is our deductible and werent even going to call in the claim ! ! <p> Weare trying to finance our desperately needed kitchen remodel and please do n't  hate me for saying- I wish I was in your shoes right now and the insurance was going to cover it ! ! Have fun planning your remodel- but I 'm sorry you are trying to work for the time being in a messed up kitchen . <p> Indeed the kitchen is my favorite place at home . Unfortunately we live in a rented apartment so i can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessorize it helps and i do have a nice functional kitchen now I love the kitchen in the second photo with the white and wood and the big baskets , so warm and inviting <p> Hi Kate Happy New Year . I love the first pic under your header " Tile to the Ceiling " but can not find the source to pin that pic for future reference . Can you provide the source ? Thanks for always inspiring <p> A very personal take on trends and u-turn on the subject .. I think trends are going to head into another direction , meaning we will not be attached to them as we are now . The ideas will bring our decor together , but believe we will begin to do more of what works for us and incorporate who we are along with creative concepts . So many of the trends are designer concepts and yes we need them for beginnings to a kitchen of dreams . concepts which work individually , definitely workings of new appliance builds . But trends bring so many stories pf those buying homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful new kitchen for the direction of said trends .. <p> Taking a chance on the above comment.I do love the kitchens and would be thrilled to have any one of them . There are some great concepts to work with . One trend which I am tired of is tiled backsplashes . Without an answer as to other options . Although I do like the board/batten on long . Which says a bit about my decor choices . <p> I love the look of all of these kitchens ( except the brass fittings not a fan of brass ! ) . I particularly love the kitchen in the photo , fourth from the bottom , with the gorgeous farmhouse sink ! <p> Personally , as much as I like the look of no upper cabinets and open shelving neither of these options would work for me . I need the storage and I do n't  think my kitchen could possibly remain tidy enough to look good without hiding a few things behind closed doors . At the moment , I do have upper cabinets and I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have some open shelving to display some of my teapot collection . <p> I love the look of butcher-block countertops but , am unsure how long they will look nice in my kitchen . <p> I love this post Kate and I could n't agree more with majority of this list . I immediately fell in love with the two color cabinetry look about two years ago when I decided to paint my own and I 'm so glad its having a lasting presence . I 'm also so happy to see people getting rid of uppers all together . I 'm a huge fan of open shelving and I think once people embraced the notion that a kitchen does n't  really have to have them it made it more comfortable to be acceptable . When we embarked on our kitchen revamp I wanted so badly to completely get rid of my uppers but could n't due to ventilation issues so I removed the doors and it was the best decision I ever made . Ill never have a kitchen without open shelving ever again ! You know what else I 'd really love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird and a little old school but I 'd love to see more people embracing smaller kitchens and preferring them over large expansive ones . I love small , efficient , well designed kitchens with even hope to see more eat in style kitchens again . <p> I love how people personalize their kitchens . Our kitchen is separated from the great room by a 17 foot counter where everyone gathers . It forces me to keep the kitchen clean all the time ! ( Well , most days . ) I look forward to a similar post about master bath trends that are here to stay . Please ? <p> I love wood counters , painted cabinetry , and open shelving . I even love some tilework . But brass fixtures ? Never . Nope . Never , ever , ever . I never care what 's trendy or hot at the moment and only decorate with what I love . I can guarantee that will never be brass fixtures ! : D <p> Ha Frankie , you 're not alone ! Others have mentioned their hatred of brass fixtures too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the late 80s and early 90s , we had those in my house when I was younger <p> I see soap stone in photo #6 . EVERYONE talked me out of it . We live REALLY hard , and in the long run I 'm probably grateful . They all told me I 'd had the scratches . So we chose granite , but we do have a butcher block island ! I really do n't  find it hard to maintain at all . I oil it about every 6 months , and just use a squirt bottle with a tablespoon of bleach in it to wipe it down . Only thing I lay a plastic cutting board down for are onions/garlic and meat . I love the more rustic and cuts it is getting . <p> Still laughing with you Michelle about brassnot so much . <p> White Kitchens ADORE . Have had a white kitchen my entire homeowners experience , and would do it again ! SO glad we went with thermafoil ! It is shrink-wrapped around ( probably ) MDF . But NOTHING sticks to them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they NEVER have to be painted ! Love thermafoil ! <p> Lastly no to open shelves . To me they look cluttered and we really cook A LOT ! I have a hard time keeping my hood and the spices and stuff I do keep out , clean ! I cant imagine the collection of grease my dishes would have ! <p> Great post Kate ! The images are beautiful ! I agree that kitchens are tough because of the permanency of the materials . I have not remodeled our 1990s kitchen , but this post gives me lots of inspiration for the future ! ! xo , Jennifer <p> Love the kitchens in the blog beautiful design ideas . On the trends : I love open shelvingin someone elses kitchen . I think it is beautiful , but it requires a lot of time and effort to keep up with the organization and presentation . I also question how it will age . For me , it works best in combination with cabinets , especially in nook areas that are otherwise unusuable , and when what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my job , work with realtors . They cringe when they go into a kitchen with " open shelving " . Few of us have both the time and inclination to keep the items on the shelves well organized and artfully displayed . Disorganized shelves do n't  show well a real consideration if you are planning to sell in the next 1-3 years . <p> I like the painted cabinets , especially the two-toned . And I love white cabinets and appliances . It always looks so fresh . Butcherblock countertops ( they add so much warmth to a kitchen ) are a wonderful ( and budget friendly ) alternative to stone . There is no doubt Ikea has been a game changer in the furniture world , especially cabinets . They have brought great , modern style for a minimal investment very moderate budgets can produce great results . I have a friend who has had her Ikea kitchen for 6 years and it has held up beautifully . Great way to start out the new year thinking about a kitchen update . <p> Great post ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Michigan and I love that you 've shared the fact that they are way warmer than stone options Truth is , they are a lot quieter too . We have these special finishes at our shop that make the tops zero maintenance . You do n't  even have to rub oil on them regularly ! They are water and stain resistant too ! <p> Love your round-up . We are in the process of doing our kitchen , and I love transitional/traditional , so when we designed it , I chose a wood cabinet stained a pecan color which I have in other built-ins -on one wall with the fridge , ovens and pantry , then the bottom cabinets throughout , and the top cabinets on the other walls are white . Oiled bronze handles on all looks wonderful , with a dark oak floor . Look on HOUZZ ladies . There are literally millions of pictures and some are labeled as to supplier or color . You can compile your own scrapbooks . I am a good and frequent cook , and the though of open shelving makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . <p> So love all your thoughts , I even think these trends can cross over into bathrooms as well to some degree . Most warning " trend " the bistro open shelves , it just looks like you ran out of money or ideas . I wouldnt.t demo any perfectly good cabinet for this idea . <p> Trends that need to go-desks in the kitchen and all those words on the walls . Im bored by both . <p> I love all these trends and that we have so many choices ! Brass faucets are so pretty , especially if they are bridge ones ! My kitchen has two colored cabinets and bronze fixtures . I just posted some photos to my blog today if you 'd like to see . : ) <p> I definitely think that the warmth timber can bring to a kitchen is an enduring trend . The only one out of this great list you 've put together that I would be wary to use is the open shelving . I think in small kitchens it can make the space look cluttered and messy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these " trends " listed can very well be " timeless " if you incorporate what you like and you 're happy in the end . My now project is to change my fairly small 1986 medium oak cabinet kitchen to a white French country kitchen on no or very few bucks . No big remodel or renovation no change possible in footprint so why pay for new cabinets when current can be painted . Did n't  care much for open shelving and would never do it all over but just saw a pic with my setup of corner sink below window with dishwasher to the right and then a patio door . Cabinet over dishwasher had been removed and open shelving in its place made it all look very open and airy and further brightened a relatively bright area . Thinking I might start out by just removing doors/hinges on current cabinet and painting all inside and out . Will add hardware and might even consider two-tone cabinets ( or not ) . And , of course , a new countertop butcher block grabs me for a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even quartz or other upscale do n't  want it to scream new countertop in an old kitchen ) . Thanks for all the inspiration ideas . <p> this is a great list ! I unfortunately just moved into a house that had JUST redone the kitchen , but not totally to my liking . Oh well , its not old ! One other thing Ive notice not a SINGLE window treatment in any of these photos ? ? ? Is that a new trend ? Ive been searching high and low for good options for kitchen window treatments , but it seems so many designers are leaving windows bare these days . My windows have no casing , so they are begging for a shade or SOMETHING . <p> Hi Hannah , I used to have a window treatment in my kitchen but removed it , I 'm a fan of a lot of natural light in a kitchen , but you 're right , so many are not using them now . I think if privacy is an issue then of course add them , take a peek at this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also like the way that more people are using large bottom drawers instead of traditional lower cabinets . You made a great list of what is popular in kitchens these days and most likely here to stay . Now I 'm dreaming of an updated kitchen . : - ) <p> Do you have any more information on the This Old House kitchen with the brass fixtures in the No Uppers category ? I 'm trying to find out the color used on the cabinets and have been unable to find out any information on the picture . <p> I appreciate the observations , but can not stomach the thought of a resurgence in brass fixtures of any kind . Some things , ( like leggings in the fashion world ) should never go around twice . I often wonder as well how the folks with open shelves deal with the everyday dust , dirt , and pet hair that floats through the air . While appealing to look upon , I do n't  think my OCD tendencies toward a clean kitchen could handle an open shelving concept . <p> While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelving with pets , dust . frying , and everyday dirt settling down on my clean dishes just makes me shudder . Glass fronts are fine , open , not so much . <p> I keep seeing all this open cabinet trend in kitchens . I have only this to say using this idea it must be necessary to either have very few dishes = running the dishwasher on a more regular basis , and running all the open dishaware through the dishwasher at least once a week . Dishes pick up dust ! <p> I think you were correct about the brass coming back in trend , but with a modern twist . The old ornate traditional style of Brass hardware that was typically on cherry cabinets and furniture is still dated . But the new brass hardware is being manufactured in sleek modern styles and when paired with new gray cabinetry and light marble or quartz countertops , it does not look dated . It just has to be done right . I suspect that brass paired with dark cabinets , or just wood instead of painted cabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass style . The new brass pulls also often have a copper tone rather than gold as well . Google " gray cabinets brass handles " and you will see the many pics of this trend done well . <p> I love the alternative color sugestions . While white looks great in pictures , it can get dingy fast . Especially in a small kitchen . The greige and light beige are a serious consideration for our kitchen remodel . Not sure about a lot of open shelving since that is what we are getting rid of ( old fashioned pantry shelves w/no cabinets . yuck ! ) . But I am game for a few after seeing some of the pictures here . Thanks ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057572 @3257572/ <h> $10 Cabinet Makeover <p> By Kate Riley September 9 , 2013 <p> So I 'd been on the hunt for months for a little media console cabinet thingy to house books ( for now ) and a future flat screen TV ( when the budget permits ) for the studio above our garage . Lucky me , I popped into the Goodwill last week and I found this $10 cabinet that was the perfect size but not the coolest look at first glance . <p> But you know me , never deterred by initial appearances , I worked a little DIY magic on this old relic and brought it into this century with a modification that included new mirrored panels with a X pattern , primer , and white paint . <p> I think this bi-fold door cabinet would still be cool if all four panels were that raised geometric pattern but the iron grill combo totally threw me off . <p> Whatever the original designer was trying to say was n't working for me so the first thing I did was to verify the panels could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check it , ten dollars for solid wood . <p> ( If you spy one of these old fuddy duddy cabinets always check the panels to see if they 're removable . It 's a more difficult process to cut them out if they 're not but it could still be done . ) Anyway , I wanted to simplify the busyness of the panels and make it look more contemporary , hence the new mirrored panels with the criss cross X motif . <p> I sanded the top with my orbital sander since it suffered from surface damage , a few scratches , etc . <p> I 'm a Zinsser girl so I 've gotten in the habit of using the spray formula for vertical surfaces but rolling on a coat of the brush on to the top ( sometimes two coats ) . I find for heavily used horizontal surfaces ( coffee tables &amp; kitchen tables ) , the brush/roll on formula provides extra durability . I always use foam rollers designed for cabinets and then toss it when I 'm done . <p> Just like with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mirror cut to fit my cabinet doors . $11.51 for four pieces yes eleven dollars and fifty one cents total for custom cut mirror , ca n't beat that ! <p> To secure the mirror to the inside of the primed cabinet doors , I used a household silicone adhesive sealant , this one has always worked well for me for adhering glass to most anything . <p> I painted the cabinets with Chalk Paint in Pure White . I 'd been wanting to try this color for a long time since I 've always used Old White in the past , and this hue is what it says it is : pure white . AS Chalk Paint does n't usually require priming but old stained oak will bleed so a primer that blocks stains saves you time and headache if bleeding should occur . <p> To create the X pattern , I picked up two 8 foot pieces of flat lattice at Lowes . <p> Matt cut the angles with our miter saw with the same technique used on these criss cross planters . I adhered the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small gaps with lightweight spackling . <p> A little touch up paint and new glass knobs was all the cabinet needed and it has a whole new look . <p> For now I 'm using it for storage but the plan is to use it as a media cabinet in the future with a flat screen on top and equipment/DVDs below . <p> The acrylic lamp I bought at Target years ago , it 's been sitting in a closet waiting for a new spot , but good news it 's still available . The typographic Manhattan print by Famille Summerbelle is available here ( frame from IKEA ) , and the retro silver wall phone I ordered a few months ago from here . <p> I know I 've been saying it for years , but it 's true , the Goodwill can be such a goldmine ! <h> 202 comments <p> Love your makeovers on crappy furniture . You 're a superstar ! With your tips , I dared to give a Draper Dresser inspired treatment to an awful dresser I bought on Craigslist . There are nine drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and not very deep dresser but perfect for our bedroom . I used the colors " drumskin " and " Mark Twain Grey " . Bought ring pulls online , and centered on each drawer . Had mirror cut for the top . Looks elegant . The before and after is a showstopper ( surprisingly ! ) . Thank you so much for your blog ! Just love it : D <p> Probably one of my favorite makeovers in a long time ! I 'm not so good at visualizing what could be . Ive been looking for a TV cabinet like that.well , like the After.now I know what to look for ! Great job ! <p> I love it ! What a transformation . I 'm always on the look-out at Goodwill , but that guy would be priced $50 or more at the ones I go to . Its become a little unreasonable . Hoping to find some gems for my new home though ! ! <p> Oh my word ! That 's an incredibly transformation . I probably would have been intimidated by the iron scroll work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it and made it glamorous . Well done you ! <p> This makeover is GORGEOUS ! Thanks for taking me through every single step and product . You are a master of DIY but for those of us who arentthe steps are key ! Beautiful job . I cant believe how high end it looksreminds me of a ZGallerie find . <p> WOWZER ! ! ! That is a fantastic makeover ! ! ! And a great Goodwill find ! Beautiful ! My Goodwill is seriously lacking in the furniture department . Not sure where it all is , but there has got to be a stock somewhere . <p> Amazing what you do with furniture ! Have you every looked at woot.com lately ? I saw a 47 ? flat screen that 's the same as what we have , but refurbished for significantly less than what we paid for it ! Just a thought . <p> Kate , I have been following you for years , and you still continue to inspire me ! I love this cabinet.what a talent you have ! This brought a smile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugs from South Carolina <p> Thanks for this ! It looks beautiful . I have a dining room hutch from my grandmother . The crown and base moldings are beautiful , but the base cabinet has a similar vibe to yours . Youve given me the motivation and inspiration to perform a little surgery and start painting . <p> Oh Kate ! ! ! ! This is one of the loveliest makeovers I have ever seen ! I have seen so many cabinets similar to that one but I have truthfully never even thought about doing anything like this to them . I LOVE how your beautiful , creative mind works ! Great job ! I am so impressed . as always . ; - ) I hope you have a lovely day ! xo , amber <p> I actually said " say what ? " and then I saw you posted it too ! hahahaha ! Amazing transformation Kate ! I would n't have guessed how you 'd flip this baby ! ! ! ! Your skills and talent are just phenomenal ! ! ! ! I would buy a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I agree nice job . In defence of the designer : The holey back makes me think this was a media cabinet before the days of using that term . You would put ( large ) speakers inside the grille panels . This " Mediterranean " look was somewhat popular in the seventies , as I recall . : ) <p> Wow ! First , that is a great deal ( that I usually do n't  see at our Goodwill : prices are much higher ! ) and the vision you had with that is mindblowing ! Also , I did n't  know Lowes would custom cut glasscant wait to think of a project I need glass for ! <p> Wow gorgeous ! My Goodwill has the WORST furniture selection . I went in the other day to check it out and there was a guy cleaning a piecea woman walked by and said " You better spray that thing for bugs before you do anything else " . That says it all <p> Love it ! I 'm about to do a dresser makeover with AS chalk paint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome on your piece . Did you seal it all ? Or wax it ? I need to be sure the top of my dresser is water resistant and am not sure what to use . This will be my FIRST piece of furniture . <p> This is just beautiful . Did n't  know that about the panels , some are removable . Will have to be on the lookout for something similar the next time I 'm out thrifting . Love , love , love it ! What a modern and clean look it now has . <p> Just thinking you will probably come up for some awesome use the for pieces you took off ! Maybe one of your great planters . No pressure , but just saying.when your mind works that way , you almost ca n't help yourself . <p> Awesome ! Best post to date in my opinion ! I cant believe you saw that vision in the $10 cabinet . What a transformation . You have me inspired and I want to go to Goodwill now and find my own treasure : ) <p> Wow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen one as amazing as this ! I cant believe you turned that ugly goodwill cabinet into a contemporary piece that would retail for several hundred dollars . <p> Obsessed . : ) It is so gorgeous , Kate , and I love knowing how much each of the little pieces of mirror and lattice cost it helps to get a feel for how I could recreate something like that someday . Beautifully done . <p> My parents had a sister piece to that cabinet for the longest time . They may still have it in their bedroom I just havent been in there in awhile . Wow ! Such a great transformation . Looks beautiful now ! Well done ! <p> And this is why I will always consider you the queen of furniture makeovers . You have such a great ability to see beyond what is given to you , and always know how to make any piece shine bright . I have been wanting to add mirror fronts to some cabinets in my studio , but was n't sure where to have them cut , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to do this . It looks like a very expensive piece of furniture . I know what I 'm looking for on my next goodwill trip ( although prices here are much higher ) . Thanks also for what and where to look/buy the products you use . Sometime blogs will say what they used , but not exactly what it is . Bonus if you tell us the general area the products are in ( lattice is in the XYZ section of the store ) Lowes is a big store ! <p> First of all , it look amazing never would have thought to look and see if the panels are removable but from now on I will . Second of all , I CAN NOT believe you got that for $10 you 'd never find something like that for $10 at our overpriced Goodwill ! <p> Amazing , Kate ! I think my parents may have that same cabinet ha ! You have such talent . I would never be able to look at that piece and see what it can become . So thankful you share your inspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got up and walked over to the other side of the room to show my husband . I cant believe you scored it for $10 ! I have not been having much good luck at Goodwill lately . But decorating karma will be on my side soon ! Your DIYs are the best ! <p> C-A-RAZY bargain ! I did something very similar to a credenza a few years back though it cost me closer to $70 ! You get the BEST deals . Love the xs ( I am slightly obsessed with xs on furniture ) . xoxo PS The previous issue with the weird links is working fine now , so hopefully it is no longer a problem for you . <p> AMEN on the Goodwill . I have said many times on Houzz that if you want to decorate your house for less money and maybe a little elbow grease ( remind me where I put that jar of elbow grease at ) go to the Goodwill or other Thrift Store . You truly have to be open to the experience and what you might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try the chalk paints out myself . Did you seal it with anything ? I may have missed that . Teresa <p> I have to tell you this is the BEST revamp that I have seen from all the other sites that I visit . You did a really awesome job . It takes a good imagination to see past the ugly to the beauty that you have created . Best wishes to you and your future projects . What a GREAT JOB ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I gathered it may have been for stereo equipment Karen because of the speaker like backing behind those grills , but then observed it was a solid panel , hmmm . Perhaps it was meant for the doors to be opened when playing , but well have to keep one door open and folded to the side when TV/DVD watching is happening . : ) <p> The after picture completely blew me away . I totally expected that there were mirrors behind the iron which was newly pantednope ! Ca n't even tell its the same cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've had an empty frame for awhile . Can they do ovals ? <p> This makeover completely blew me away and completely inspired me ! That is the true joy of creativity , sometimes all you need is a little inspiration and you 're off and running on your own project . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Kate , Seriously ! I mean can I just walk around the inside of your creative mind for like , say , an hour ? I mean I used to think I was a creative soul and then I stumbled upon you a couple of years ago and you continue to blow me away with your ability to see beyond what is in front of you . What a gift , and the fact that you share it with us without charging ! That is the true beauty of " paying it forward " the gifts God has given you ! Thank You . <p> Stunning ! You did an amazing job . I have been out searching for the same type of piece and this would have also been much more expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pure White this weekend on a project , for the first time and was considering doing a table with it . Did you use a roller for the top of this to get a smoother finish ? <p> HA Your age is showing.It is a throw back to the Mediterranean style , so very popular in the 70s . Great deal and an awesome make over to something way better then faux Mediterranean style . I love it , clean and contemporary . <p> This is brilliant . Im inspired to do more thrift shopping . I usually get discouraged when i find nothing of value or at high price tag at Goodwill . Maybe I need to have a little more faith in good luck . <p> Wow ! ! ! I think this is one of my favourite makeovers ever ! You took good solid but ugly piece of furniture and turned it into something absolutely beautiful . Now I 'm going to be looking for a cabinet with removable inserts in the doors . Thanks for the inspiration . <p> That is GORGEOUS ! Amazing transformation . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same piece as before ! So after using ASCP pure white and old white , which one do you like working with better and which color ? I 'm thinking of trying ASCP but not sure which of the whites to get . Thank you ! Sharon <p> This post could not be more timely . I have been looking for EXACTLY that type of console/sideboard ! I actually saw a near identical piece ( mirrored with x-design ) on Hooked on Houses Little Couple and fell in LOVE and looked everywhere but never found one less than 1000 buckaroos . I could n't believe it when I saw the after . I NEVER would have looked at that cabinet and thought it could be made to look like that . You have soooo inspired me . Thank you ! ! <p> I was really surprised by the pricetag too , usually these kinds of pieces are $50 or more but it was in the front of the store in a " reject " pile and I think that 's why I got so lucky with the $9.99 price tag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying to paint / update an armoire my husband and I bought a million years ago at an antique store , but he s a stickler for keeping the original wood tone . : ( Im gon na show him THIS transformation so he can see that painted furniture can look really amazing . <p> CRAZY GOOD Kate ! ! ! I hope this inspires DIYers that have been simply painting over original cabinet to hide all the heavy scroll work for the 70s . Your makeover brings it current and very budget friendly . So crazy how good you are : ) <p> That transformation is smashing ! ! Just gorgeous . When I saw your before I thought it would end up looking like a clunky dresser I transformed , ah , but no . You tricked it out so elegantly with mirror ! ! <p> here 's a good indication of what all that geometric work would have looked like painted . I do still love mine and I 'm not sure mirror would have worked , maybe on the drawers ? <p> I was on holiday abroad when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by this incredible cabinet makeover that Ive been searching my reader for this post so I could tell you how much I love it . Its hard to believe this is the same piece of furniture . <p> What a stunning makeover ! Thanks to you I was inspired to paint my 6 year old Ikea Billy bookcases from black-brown to white . They have doors on them and now I 'm excited to add mirror and the " x " design as will . Wow ! ! ! ! <p> So inspired by you ! I 'm redoing a guest room , have old but solid cherry wood dresser and end table . I would love to do the same to . I can not find the Annie Sloan chalk paint near me . What else could I use ? <p> Shut the front door ! THIS IS AMAZING ! ! ! ! ! Wow ! If I find something similar I will absolutely be copying you . I generally like before and afters as inspiration . This I am taking as direct orders and am now obsessed on finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dining room/family room transitional wall . Patience will be necessary , but with that classic design its not like its going out of style any time soon . Thanks for the inspirations . One of my favorites ever from you ! From anyone for that matter . <p> Luckily there are people like you in the world who see one thing and can imagine it as something completely different . What a great choice you made to swap out those old panels for these modern , clean ones . Quite the transformation ! <p> " Unfreakingbelievable ! " Amazing what you turned that cabinet into . I 've got a ton of stuff I consider trash which you would probably see as treasure ! Wish you were my neighbor . But I 'm sure I 'd be picking your brain so much you 'd end up moving away ! ! <p> Can I just say I 'm TOTALLY jealous ? ? I live on the Gulf Coast , and good luck finding any piece of decent furniture at a thrift store for $10 . I can pretty much guarantee that if there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would probably be marked at least $75 if not more . SIGH ! ! Awesome redo though thanks for sharing the whole step by step process , so much nicer/easier to follow . <p> I have one question . When you start using it as a media cabinet , will you have to leave the doors opened when viewing your TV and using your DVR ? I have an old working stereo cabinet that is from the same period as your cabinet . My cabinet doors are fake . The ones on the end have a heavy fabric in them for the speakers . Since they do n't  open , any idea how to cut them out and then replace them without going through the back ? This piece came from my husbands 93 year old deceased aunt . I always referred to it as the booby prize . In other words , its so out of style and it very long . No one else had a vision . Your chest reflects my vision for it . They might want it back when Im done ! : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrolled down to the finished piece but I love it ! I hope you kept the iron scrolly bits for another project ? ? I am sure you could do something brilliant with them . Hope you post when you use them for something else ! Would love to see ! <p> Stunning transformation ! I just found youthank you Pinterest ! Was up till the wee hours of the morning reading through your old postsyou are so gifted with talent &amp; insight ! ! ! I 'm curious/ ok confused about how the mirrors were appliedwere you able to silicone glue them directly to the little ledge ; able to strip the original panel &amp; apply them or cut out your own sturdier backing for the mirrors ? Thank you for your response &amp; making us drool over your inspiring transformations ! <p> Oops ! I just read it againyou applied the mirrors to the inside of the cabinet , therefore no backing ? ? ? In addition to the crisscross being beautiful they will also add some protection . My gosh you are truly brilliant ! <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of design AND because you did not ruin a valuable antique . This piece was ugly modern and begging for a makeover . ( Some makeovers make me cringe when they blow away a hundred year old gorgeous wood grain that can not be restored even if its stripped . ) Great job ! <p> I agree with every complimentary review here ( WOWZA ! ) , and I really appreciate the PRICES for most of the materials you usedI need HELP in this area as I am finding great pieces cheap ( or free ) and then spending way way too much fixing them up . You 're showing rescue &amp; restore rookies like moi how its doneTHANK YOU ! <p> What a beautiful makeover ! I never would have believed that it once looked the way it did ! You did a great job in renovating that cabinet . I also wanted to thank you for posting pictures of all your materials , it really helps for when I have to remodel my sisters house this coming Spring ; I 'll know exactly what I need to buy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this amazingly detailed post !

As you know I love love LOVE to travel , and a few weeks ago returned from a 12 day trip to Scandinavia . That region had been on my bucket list forever and I absolutely loved every minute of my visit . I traveled there in late April so it was still cold and required a jacket every day . We had some foggy days and a little rain but also plenty of sunny ( yet chilly ) days too . Here 's just a sampling of what I saw on my travels through Denmark , Norway , and Sweden . <p> On arrival I stayed with some friends who live an hour outside Copenhagen on my first night so I was able to see some of the countryside of Denmark . So lovely ! I also spent two full days in Copenhagen and was so charmed by it . One ca n't visit without a stop to the iconic Nyhavn where you 'll spy colorful homes along the canals , an abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch a canal tour . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Copenhagen is a very walkable city and possesses the charm of other European cities with its cafes , fountains , copper spires , and- architecture . I walked around the city about 5-6 miles a day ducking down so many streets and past landmarks . <p> - <p> - <p> I stopped in a few churches as well and walked to the Church of our Savior to climb up the spire . While in Copenhagen do n't miss a stroll around Tivoli Gardens . There 's a really beautiful hotel there too , I was smitten with the interiors and floral arrangements in the Nimb Hotel , and especially the elegant bar . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> One thing you ca n't escape in Copenhagen are the marvelous pastries and breads , I recommend popping into one of the many bakeries to sample the deliciousness ! <p> - <p> Who does n't love Danish design ? I found myself browsing in several shops and wanting to take home so much ! <p> - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to journey to Norway which was so fun ! I woke up the next morning peering out my window staring at the charming seaside villages and homes that you pass on your way to Oslo . It 's a nice view to take in while you eat your breakfast ! <p> I spent two days in my travel companion 's hometown of Askim where we visited with her family and friends then it was back to Oslo to explore that city for a few days . Thankfully we had a lot of sunshine and spring was in the air . <p> - <p> We hit the ground running and walked all over this city too . We watched the changing of the guard at the palace that was interesting to watch . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> A big highlight was Vigeland Park , it 's a popular place in Oslo and it 's filled with hundreds of sculptures completed by a single artist , each one unique and amazing . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Also worth your visit are the Folk Museum where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see ships from the 1100s . <p> - <p> - <p> Oslo was very easy to walk around just like Copenhagen and around every corner so much charm , especially at twilight when the downtown area is all lit up and you can duck into pubs or cafes and people watch to your heart 's content . <p> - <p> - <p> Our last stop along the journey was Stockholm and we booked a train ride from Oslo train station directly to Stockholm and it was a gorgeous journey through birch forests past lakes and- little towns in the Swedish countryside . Train rides through Europe are one of my favorite things in life and this trip had my staring out the window the entire five hours . <p> Stockholm is an vibrant city centered on many islands so there are waterways and ferries everywhere . <p> - <p> - <p> There are several amazing neighborhoods in this city , the most popular for tourists is the charm of old town Gamla Stan filled with shops and cafes , it 's a great place to spend a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much beautiful architecture everywhere you go in Stockholm and the beginning of spring was on display when I arrived . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> I spent a fun afternoon in the trendy S+dermalm neighborhood with its shops and cafes , that was a cool place to walk around . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> If you 're up for a unique experience and like cocktails , make a reservation for the Ice Bar where they 'll dress you in a blanket coat and serve you your drink of choice in a glass made of ice ( just like the rest of the room ! ) <p> - <p> Like I did in Copenhagen , I loved looking at all the shops in Stockholm , in so many I observed such great design and well curated decor . <p> - <p> Of course no trip to Stockholm is complete without dining on classic Swedish meatballs , these were better than IKEA ; ) <p> - <p> What surprised me was I never felt a language barrier traveling in the big cities of Scandinavia because most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't make an effort to speak basic phrases , I do believe that 's polite ! - I loved the people and the food and the sites of all three Scandinavian countries and I would n't hesitate to return to explore more of the countryside . Hope you enjoyed the pics ! Comment with any questions you may have . : ) <p> Those are all from my iPhone 6 ! I stop taking along my DSLR camera on big trips when I got it , for the most part I 'm satisfied with the quality and its far easier to snap pics on a phone than with a big camera . The composition just comes from some editing in photoshop elements : ) <p> Hi Anne ! They have a festival on April 30th that welcomes the start of spring , I was there on my last day , that 's a lot of fun the Swedes parade through the streets with lit torches and light a big bonfire down by the water . Very festive and fun ! Its called Walpurgis Night . May is really gorgeous so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when lots of tourists visit . I understand August and September have good weather too . <p> Thanks for the great photos ! When our kids are older ( we have 5 kids under age 9 ) we plan to go Norway , Sweden and Finland . We are of that heritage . Also my bro in law is from Norway and one of my brothers is dating a girl who was born in Sweden . We have never been but hear so much about the beauty of the scandinavian countries ! My sister has made several trips there and Norway is beyond beautiful she says ! <p> Ive been to Stockholm twice , -two years in a row- and its my fave city so far . I may go back again this summer for another concert . The food is great ( smoked salmon for breakfast , loved it ) and there was no language barrier to speak of , like you mentioned . Did you visit Stockholms city hall ? Its a must ! <p> Thank you for this fun post and pictures . My 18 year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He also loves the architecture and has sent home a lot of pictures of buildings in Stockholm . He keeps telling me about all of the delicious pastries he eats during fika ( Swedens afternoon tea/coffee time ) . Did you experience a fika while there ? Sounds charming .

There 's something about the glossy smooth surface and clean lines that had me wanting to incorporate this very modern look in our bedroom . <p> For example , this white Parsons desk had me thinking it was the perfect bedside table . <p> You 'll recall I repainted this Dorothy Draper knock off in blue and white last summer for the guest space read all about it in this post . But this little chest was n't getting used in there , and I needed a new nightstand , so repurposed it in our room instead . I gave it two coats of Rustoleum 's Gloss White ' spray paint , a new favorite , and then hand painted the detail with an artist 's brush and three coats of champagne gold paint ( a custom blend ) now it 's so very glam in our room ! <p> * Reader inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted with oil based formulas , so it was safe to go over it with more oil based spray paint .

I used to shy away from it because it seemed so " factor-finished " to me but now I like the shine and its really easy to clean : ) With kids around its important that things be functional , easy to care for and STYLISH ! Great post , I love your nightstand and gold is another thing that has been catching my eye recently ! <p> I am in love with the laquer but it does n't  really fit my house . Perhaps an accent like you have would work , but the look does n't  seem to go with all my ancient wood . What beautiful pictures to inspire anyone .

One piece seems to do the trick . ; ) Love the green you chose , and I bet the nightstand looks great in your room ! <p> I love glossy white lacquerso easy to care for , so pretty , so shiny . I wanted the mini-desk for a bedside table too , but it did n't  fit in the space . Instead I hacked an Ikea childrens table and put longer legs on it and painted it white for a similar lookbut its not shiny like the lacquer . Love the nightstand you did : - ) <p> I love lacquered furniture , especially in white ! I recently purchased the mini Parson Desk from West Elm ( on sale for $130 might I add ) and coincidentally it is right next to my bed .

Just made me drool . Then you post thisare we going to see a trend ? <p> I love it !

A 10 lb box is $10 dollars and goes fast . The small paints cost about $1 to $2 each depending on the craft store , the large bottles of patio paint are $4 . The other supplies are whatever they cost at your grocery store . <p> What a great idea ! Not only that it 's a project that people living in multiple-family housing can do . <p> I recently moved to an apartment while searching for a new home and there are restrictions on things like spray paint ( I do it anyway , shhhh ) and such but without a garage or backyard some projects just ca n't be done or done well . <p> CONCRETE ( as cement is an ingredient in concrete and pretty worthless without water and aggregate ) does n't stick to anything that you spray down with Pam . this is how they form things in the field spray the plywood with a little bit o ' Pam .

Thank you so much for posting this ! ! I love the look of your candleholders ( and everything else Ive seen here so far ! ) and will be borrowing this idea soon ! ! <p> This was one of the first things I saw when I discovered your blog last month . I finally finished 3 candle holders for my m-i-l for Mothers Day . Now I 'm going to work on some for myself . Its real damp here in the Willamette Valley so it took them several days to totally dry out so that I could paint them . After painting them I glued glass pebbles along the rim , using E-6000 . Great idea . Thanks for sharing . <p> Thank you for this perfectly clear tutorial . It is so easy to make these cement candle holders ! I had seen some cement candle holders and I was trying to figure out in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and my process was not this simple lol . <p> You can grow moss on them . It looks pretty for the garden . Take yoghurt and rinsed moss and put it in a blender . Paint the cement with the blend . You do n't  have to wait until the cement is dry . The moss needs watwr to grow . Also , if you make containers for plants you can add some perlite to the cement , to make it less heavy . Saying that I do n't  know the produkt you use . I use a recepie for ordinary cement ( very cheap ) and replace the sand with spagnum and the pebles with perlite , to make it less heavy . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057583 @3257583/ <h> 144 comments <p> Just when I decided on one " white space " I scroll down and see another I love ! I cant get enough of white spaces and warm woods . They are the perfect marriage of masculine and feminine . Do n't  you think ? <p> and a white space with the pop of energetic color never hurt either . Thanks for this roundup ! <p> I love white ! I have been on a white-painting binch lately and the streak has not ended . But I do n't  think I could do an all white room . I love it in pictures but in real life I would miss colors . So I go for white as the perfect backdrop to seasonal colors . <p> I 'm a color girl . I admire whites from afar but I cant see myself having an all white room . My duvet is all white and that 's as white as I get : ) . Although I have to admit , once finances stabilize I 'm paining our kitchen white ! I agree that a white kitchen is timeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times over the past couple of months because I am getting ready to paint our living area . SInce we have an open floor plan , that means the living room , dining room , and kitchen . I wonder if I will tire of the white when the trend moves on . However , I am not planning on doing to total white immersion thing . My furniture will not be going white . Great question I will wait and see what the rest of your followers have to say <p> Currently , I think it has become a trend , but refreshingly so . For years the trend was Morrocan , Medditeranean and Tuscan decor which all were heavy ( dark ) on color in paint and fabric . Although I loved the Tuscan trend myself , I was happy to see it go . Now , it seems that the trend is to go lighter and fresher . I am sure white will always be a classic design color , but the " all-white " look as well as the beachy and coastal trend will one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love decorating with white , but I have to have splash of color somewhere in there ! Most of my furniture is white , but I do have a few pieces of natural wood and a beautiful aqua chest of drawers for a bit of boldness . As for the all white kitchen I 'm all in ! : ) <p> I have been pondering this very thought . I agree the white kitchen is a classic . But , entire white rooms have had their day before and it always seems to ebb and flow in and out of trends . There will always be the lovers of color and some will always hold on to their white . I love white but , having raised three boys I have never ventured into the white paint chips with them in the house. ; ) Sherry <p> Hi Kate ! I hope you remember me ( we emailed back and forth and you gave me some fantastic advice on dealing with life as an attorney/wannabe **31;408;TOOLONG ! ) . I absolutely love , love , LOVE white and tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . It is timeless ! That IS why God invented Pottery Barn slipcovered sofas- to make white more liveable ! ! : ) I finally struck out and started my own blog- Ive just gotten started but please check it out and continue to watch for all of our progress ( major furniture refinishing and bathroom renovation to come ) ! www.10junem.blogspot.com I actually just blogged about my white couch today ! ! <p> I 've just finished my bedroom in my very first house ( ! ! ! ! ) and every time I walk into it I feel a sense of calm and peace , very spa-like . Its balanced with a wood floor and a soft turquoise on the upper part of the walls ( white paneling on the bottom ) . I wish I was there right now ! <p> White rooms look good when they 're well thought out and purposeful , but I think I 'd just make it look blah . I 'm very much indie , homey , autumn-like in nature , so I like saturated colors and natural woods . If you can pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . ; - ) <p> And I think all-white ( floors , painted wood , cloth ) is trendy , but white with natural woods and pops of color is more classic . <p> I love the white timeless kitchen ( and wish it was mine ) but for all that other white , it IS so calm and charming in the photos ( and I can only dream ! ) , but in real life , I think it would be stressful , and I 'd be spending all my time trying to get tomato sauce out of the slipcovered chairs . No thanks ! <p> I do n't  think I could do all white because I love colour too much ! I loved the images above where a little colour was injected here and there . I love the look of a white couch , but I do n't  think I could do it with kids . I know , I have heard about slipcovers and bleach too , but it just seems like too much work ! To get the white look without compromising your furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not live in an all-white room . 1 ) because I have italian Greyhounds , which are impossible to keep off the furniture , and 2 ) it just feels so . overwhelming . Like a padded room . <p> That 's not to say that I hate those white rooms , but I do feel there needs to be a break somewhere , a pop of color or something to contrast all that snowy whiteness . I think white is classic , clean , and crisp , but I like it more as an accent for other colors , like teal or chocolate or apple green . <p> I love white not so much on the walls , but furnishings , duvet covers , cabinets , even white marble floors are beautiful ! ! ! ! I think that like all things eventually an all white room will be a trend but white things in a room will NEVER go out of style . I agree with needing a place to rest my eyes . I 'm a lover of contrast somethings soft to surround me in then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did read recently that white is a good color ( or lack of color ) to use with children , as you can always bleach out the stains. hmmmm .. I grew up with brothers and sometimes no amount of bleach would ever get out the stains they left behind for my poor mom . <p> Well , I 'll be brave and admit I am tired of looking at blog after blog of things covered with a coat of white paint . In fact , I 'm starting to unsubscribe when that is all I see . So I guess my vote is trendy . <p> I love white ! Its both timeless and trendy now ! I find myself spray painting a lot of things white . But I like color too ( turquoise ! ) and my hubby likes warm woods . Were trying to find that balance we like . I 've got a white duvet and white couches from IKEA . With a 3 and 5 year old , white slipcovers and bleach are the way to go ! Love them ! Plus I throw a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that helps me do less wash with muddy paws . Oh , the dog is white too ! <p> I love all white when it is in all different textures . Ive been accepted to hastings for my final year of law school ( yippee ) due to husbands job change , so off to San Francisco we move ! It tends to be so so cold and dreary that you need light and warmth . White fur rug , fur pillows , white drapes , might just be the very ticket ( second to last photo , love love ) <p> I do love white rooms , but I think everything needs a splash of color ! I am in love with Amy Butlers fabrics and their bod patterns . So I try to incorporate small pops of color into my white spaces . Love love all the pics you posted ! ! ! <p> I have asked myself this very question several times over the course of a few months . I desperately want to decorate at least one space in my house all white but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is I love so many different things and right now I have to wonder if I love the look of crisp white because I am seeing it everywhere and because it is summer and everyone is " lightening up " . Thanks for the round up and I 'm glad to know I am not the only one dealing with this dilemma . <p> I am on a " white " experimennt to see how much I can live with it in real life . I bought a white slipcover for my sofa and some white bookcases . The bookcases have done well in my household , but the white slipcover has had a couple of runs in the washer it attracts all the stains my 3 year old and 7 year old ( and husband ! ) bring/develop/eat/play with . I have now taken to covering my slipcover with a blanket . I do n't  think Im winning this one . I 've had my eye on a PB slipcovered sectional ( in white , of course ! ) but given the current state of my not-quite-white sofa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not as fashionable as the look I was going for ( cottage comfy ) but it will have to do . I do not want to live my life yelling at my kids or keeping a hawks eye out for any spots . <p> I love the clean fresh look of white too . But I do n't  think I could live in a white room , it would be like a show room not practical living space for me anyway . Loved all the pictures though . I 'm more of a splash of color kind of gal . <p> I think that all white appeals more to a younger generation a sweeping generality ! People who have been around a little longer and have things collected over the years tend to want to live with them and love the color they bring- another sweeping general statement . <p> This is a topic that I have a definite opinion on ! ! ! ! There is a huge diffference between white and white done right . Trendy- an all white room that looks like the a painter and a paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Trendy- no other color but white , it looks like death ! Trendy- bright white , it looks to harsh Tready- taking a beautiful gorgeous wood piece , like GOOD mahogny and painting it white ! YIKES ! Timeless- Warm white with lovely woods Timeless- white with a healthy splash of color Timeless- a few pieces of white , like an ironstone display in a wood hutch Timeless- white linens Timeless- white woodwork and wainscotting <p> Many white rooms are etherial and pretty , but I could not LIVE in them . I have a white kitchen with chestnut floors and it works . But I have color mixed with it too ! <p> I just wonder when this trend passes , and it will over time , if many will have painted some beautiful treasures that are lost under a coat of white paint . This is just one girls opinion ! Yvonne <p> I LOVE WHITE , but I do n't  think I can live in an all white room . We are continually updating all of our linens to pure white which I just love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the dryer . <p> I cant do all whiteit feels too institutional ! Like an operating room or somewhere that needs to be bleached often . I think its very trendy and we are going to look back on it like avacado refrigerators and say " its sooooooo 2010 ! " <p> Good question , Kate ! I 've posted about the all white thing before and I definitely think its trendy . I cant get rid of all my color either , even though I think the white rooms are beautiful . I 'm happy with some lighter colors , but overall , color wins for me . I 'm not following the trend on this one ! : ) <p> Its funny to read the comments because I remember a conversation I had with friends when I was a teen . We were playing one of those personality test games and it said " Pretend you 're in an all white room with no windows and describe the feeling . " Some of my friends said theyd be totally uncomfortable , but I remember saying I 'd love it and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just imagined a bedroom decorated in all white . I had all white furniture in my room growing up , and always dreamed of having white eyelet-lace bedding . I cant remember what the answer was supposed to say about you in the test <p> I cant live without color . I like it too much ! i DO like the white spaces with the dark floors and/or furniture and splashes of color . I do n't  have kids , but I am clumsy enough myself-white is not saafe ! <p> I could imagine , in the right home , living with a space that was mostly white ; but never a space that was *all* white . And it could only be one room , never an entire house . I just love rich , saturated colors too much to live in a white-dominated space . <p> I do n't  have 100% white rooms . I like color too much . However , I do have a lot of white and white , to me , is the best color to have whether you have kids or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old and white slipcovered sofas , chair cushions , curtains , bedding , etc . I think its better to clean things than to hide dirt using colors or patterns . I cant imagine the filth on things like sofas never cleaned ( especially with kids ) and pretending like its just not there . By contrast , a spin of the slipcover in the washer with a little White Brite and everything is perfect . <p> I love looking at other peoples white rooms but I do n't  think I could live like that . I have kids and pets which means grubby little fingers and dirty pet paws . I like white for my girls bedroom furniture , serving dishes and plates but that 's about as much white as you 'll find in my home . <p> Timeless and trendy ! With so many different shades and textures of white , I do n't  think you can go wrong at all . However I do believe there has to be a splash of colour as a focal point . So absolutely LOVING the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms to ponder . I agree that there needs to be some sort of coloron the floor , the walls , accents , something . Also , I have a hard time believing pets or kids can co-exist in all-white spaces ( at least with out a full-time housekeeper ! ) smiles ! <p> Gorgeous eye candy ! I cant get enough of white . But you 're right , it can be impractical with kids and pets . I have both and decorate a lot with whites and creams . But I tend to like to use it in furniture pieces and fabrics ( curtains , slipcovers ) and not in wall colors ( wall color and some pieces of furniture/accessories is where the color comes in ) and flooring . While I do find that they 're a little more work , I still love the comfortable and bright feeling the slipcovers bring to my living room . They just occasionally have kid sized sticky hand prints , that 's all ! <p> I think right now , decorating with lots of white is very trendy . But I definitely believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go modern , traditional and even relaxed and shabby chic with white so versatile . <p> I love it , its so dreamy and relaxing to the eye ! I also believe it is timeless BUT I always have to add a pop of color . I have a few white duvets and they are really easy to clean however they get dirty really fast as well : ) XO Kristin <p> Absolutely love your blog post . Was just talking about this yesterday with a designer friend . We both love the " white " look , but just as you said , it does something so powerful for the single or few non-white elements that are added . It has the effect to high-light the other item(s) in such a powerful way . <p> Would love any feedback available about some our projects over at **29;441;TOOLONG Look forward to other great blog posts to share in the future and to talking about them with other friends who love bringing out the best in older things instead of throwing them out : - ) <p> Its like all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  like tons of color , but I do like some . And , btw , I love white slipcovers , but even bleach has stopped working on getting mine spotless 2 large black dogs , 2 teenage boys with multiple friends have taken a toll on them . But at least I can get the slipcovers semi-clean . <p> There 's something so refreshing about white . For me , a white room needs to be paired with a lot of natural texture to keep it from becoming too sterile . Because I 'm surrounded by beautiful things all day I love to come home to a peaceful and calming space . For me that means a lot of warm gray , natural texture , and lot of white . I love of pop of color every now and then . I 'd love white furniture but unfortunately two dogs and two cats ( all brown , white , and black ) make it seem impossible . <p> Both ! I think *all* white looks a little too stark . There are a few places that can do it right.but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper . Good in small amounts , but can be SO overdone if not done right . <p> Forget about kids what about men ! My preference between the two is white with hits of colour to liven things up . But , my husband is a tradesman and we could never ever ever live with all white , or any other pale colour for that matter . I find dirty boot prints on our cream carpet , dirty hand prints on the cream walls where he leans on them to take off his boots , dirty smudges around the bathroom light switch and of course he comes home and sits on the sofa in his overalls so any pale colour is just a no go for that . He s also a blokey kind of a guy with no interest in or sense of interior style and just does n't  notice half the time that he s tracking dirt after him all over the place . Thankfully , most of his work-dirt is easy to clean up , but its a constant battle . I cant imagine how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I believe white is timeless and but also think white is trendy right now . My home has black accents and dark wood furnishing and leather couches with punches of color . I love itbut I must admit that when I see pictures like these and everyone blogging about these bright crisp rooms I find that I want to make everything lighter . Oh the decisions ! <p> Timeless ! I adore white , especially in the kitchen . But I also think pops of color are a must , a pretty patterned blanket , or vivid throw rug , some bright glass accents or dark pictures . Absolutely all white needs a little punch of color , or it loses its appeal , it becomes boring . But bring focus to a few unique colorful pieces , and all white works . <p> Its pretty , but I could n't live in all white with my 3 teenage boys . I also love earthy neutrals , so I would miss having wood tones and greens around . The pictures that have all white with no relief of any color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each their own ! <p> I love the radiance White brings to a home , but I think it can be overpowering and even a little invasive . It certainly is a timeless look , but I like to mix it up a little with natural finishes and feature pieces of furniture ! <p> Thanks for the white kitchen image that is so my dream kitchen ! Love it ! <p> I love the look of white rooms , but I need to have some color . I was planning on going all white and neutrals in my guest room , but when I threw the red toile fabric in there , it was clear this room needed it . I also like dark wood floors or furniture contrasting the white . <p> The way I figure itno one is ever going to walk into a white room and say , " wow , this looks really dated ! " You can not say that about avacado green , harvest gold , or mauve and baby blue . Right ? <p> I will always love white ! Never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kids too . Granted they are older but believe me that does n't  change . It might be a trend for some but I 'll never go back . Its so relaxing to come home to . I did my bedroom first to see if I liked it . From then on little by little I found that was all I was buying ! Yup . Its a keeper for me ! &lt;3 <p> The white really does make fabulous pictures , but trying to live with it in a real world is tiring . If you have children , you know the oops messes they create and mine is gifted with the ability to magically levitate a glass 10 feet away ( tehe ) . Also , after living with white kitchen cabinets , I will NEVER have them again . Pretty ? Oh , no doubt . Easy to keep clean ? Heck , no everything and I mean even the tinest little splatter shows up on them . I slowly grew to hate them after only one year thank goodness , it was a rental and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter ( 6 y.o. ) saw me painting our bannister white today and commented " Mom , more white ? ! You sure do LOVE white ! Do n't  you think it is a bad choice since you have 4 kids " . : ) : ) I love kids and white.they are both worth a little extra cleaning ! <p> LOVE white , especially cream . But , alas , with 2 kids , 2 cats and a dog and hubby , nothing woudl stay white . I do have one Ikea chair with a white damask slipcover I wash it all the time and presently it has orange streaks ( I suspect a Cheetoh attack ) . Its frustrating , but I love it too much to throw it out . I also love my kids too much to throw them outmost days ! <p> White is crisp and clean but really like white baseboards , doors , and of course my dishes ! White towels are a must and easy to bleach out too ! I personally do n't  have white walls or furniture because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might introduce more white into the picture because it brightens everything around you ! As a decorative painter I adore colors but believe accents of white pull any room together ! <p> I love white , but I do not have an all white room in my house . I love white dishes . I collect white milk glass . And I especially like an all white kitchen . I like a pop of color in an all white room . No , I do n't  think white is trendy . It is clean and crisp and fresh looking . It is very soothing . Enjoyed your beautiful pictures . Love &amp; blessings from NC ! <p> this appears to be an appealing topic . ive recently moved to a home built in the 80s and as i stand and gawk at the powder blue shag and the flower dusty rose and blue wall paper i wonder 25 years from now , what will we look like ? seventies puke green and gold , eighties see above add a dust ruffle valances , all i have to say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiving of whatever trends come next ! <p> Its timeless , but I have to admit that I only found one or two of those pictures to my personal liking . Yes , they are all beautiful , but I would n't go there myself . I 'm afraid if I had a room like one of those that I 'd lash out in a spasm of color one day and the white room would be no more . : ) Neat decor ideas though love that ! <p> I remember being in high school and encountering my first all-white room in a small antiquing town . I became obsessed . However , I shudder to think of what the recent rain and my puppies paws would do to an all-white room ! <p> I just bought a beautiful new design mag ( cant remember the name now ) and counted NINE white kitchens in a row . Not a single home with anything BUT an all-white kitchen . I get it , I 'd love a Barefoot Countessa-Hamptons-esque kitchen , but what about those of us in a craftsman bungalow , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves warm , beautiful wood cabinets anymore ? <p> I think its trendy , but its a beautiful trend ! It just seems so impractical ! If you were single with no kids , maybe , but I see it from the vantage point of a mom with 6 kids , a dog , and 2 cats . No amount of bleach will keep white from going gray in my house . Heck , I wo n't even buy white shirts for my kids ! <p> I love a white room , but as with anything , its about finding the right white for your room . I find white to be one of the few colors ( the others being blue and grey ) that can either be warm or cool to the eye . Our house as tons of white walls ( thanks to 15 ft high ceilings and lofts ) . I focused on adding color to the rooms and left the expansive spaces white . To be that really made the places where there is color really pop and become focal points . Additionally , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of yellow rather than builders grade paint . <p> However , I do have a thing against white bathrooms.they just seem sterile to me . A white kitchen it a thing of beauty , but a white bathroom just give me a bit of the creeps . <p> I love white kitchens and I agree , wood floors with pieces is gorgeous , but I have to have some color in the room or I feel like I 'm going cross-eyed . I have seen some rooms that make me say , " Oh ! Pretty ! " but they are best kept in the magazine or online and just would n't work for our home . I also do n't  know anyone who has a room decorated with a majority of white decor . Our home , which we bought in October , has a very light cream colored carpet and I cant stand it . Wood flooring is going in after the wedding ! <p> Gorgeous photos that you posted ! I love all white alone and I love all white with a little pop of color here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think white is a very timeless , peaceful , clean and simple color . I think right now it tends to be a bit trendy but overall I think it is a timeless colorif that makes sense . Right now I 'm kind of into white with beige , ivory and turquoise accents . I do love those photoslots of inspiration ! <p> Great post ! I LOVE the look of all white but would never ever have it in my house . Not even because of the kiddo I just think it can come off so cold and void of character if not done really , really , REALLY well . I NEED warmth and color . I need a room to hug me and although I love to look at all white rooms , they do n't  give me that hug . ; ) <p> I 'd say many of the beautiful photos used on this post totally fall into the trendy category . They simply look enforced to show as much white as possible . I personally feel the rooms that fall together by trial and error over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 've come together naturally . <p> I believe they are both timeless and trendy .. but like everything else the trend will die and the timeless part will keep kicking . I love ALL of the rooms that you posted and could easily spend my night , day , afternoon , what have you , in them . <p> Definately timeless.but trendy right now . I find it to be very calming and relaxing after working in a bold colored office all day.I have white slipcovers and LOVE them .. also a clean freak . Some will say with kids or pets no way , but they get dirty regardless of the color . So I enjoy having something I can wash on a regular basis and know it is clean . All white with pops of color , texture and pattern for me . <p> I think that white rooms photograph well and are lovely . But I can not see them as practical . We just primed our kitchen walls white and have all white cabinetry and it was SCARY ! I thought at that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , I could not do it . I love the coziness of color Too much white feels sterile in my opinion . ( Of course this is coming from a mom of 4 too . ) <p> Feels trendy to me . I mean all the mags are currently dominated by this theme , whereas a few years ago it was all about color . And yes , what children can live happily amongst a house of white ? " Do n't  touch that ! Do n't  eat that there ! Do n't  spill ! " Etc , etc , etc . Its beautiful and lovely , but it almost makes me think of a home that has no life within . <p> I think its classic . I had an all white den for 10 years . I enjoyed the cool , serene environment and , contrary to popular belief , its easier to keep all white clean because you can see where the dirt is . It ca n't hide . However , my children are grown . But many years ago , when I did have children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sofa . When it got dirty , I just threw it in the washer and popped it back on the sofa . <p> I am leaning a little to the trendy side when white is the main or only color in the entire room . The picture of the dark wood floor and white bedding looks quite classic to me , I think it may come down to the variety of texture and classic forms or details . Lovely post ! <p> Its hard to say really . I think its pretty trendy right now but white always makes me feel calm and peaceful . I would live to slipcover my dark couch in white , but I do n't  have any children so I cant speak of the dirt that may show . Overall , I love it and wish I had more of it . <p> Its got ta be vanilla . That vanilla-custard feel of the girly bedroom pictured , its warm , inviting , comfy and not so icy and sterile and cold as the stark-white modern look . I love being able to bleach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and have chosen an almost all white palette with ivories , vanillas , and creamy golden whites . It gives me SO many quick and inexpensive options to totally change the color scheme of a roomdont have to repaint or anything , just add new curtains , pillows and throws , maybe a colorfully painted or repainted end table or accent piece ! I could change my decor once a month if I wantedoh , hmmm.maybe that 's exactly what I 'll do ! ! ! <p> The white kitchen you 've shown is classic so it will be around forever . It has always been my favorite . The truly all white kitchen ( white Corian counters ) did n't  last . Personally I like dark floors , true white walls , plenty of texture and a strong contrast color , be it red , turquoise , something ! <p> I agree it looks very crisp , bright and airy . However , I 'm disliking how " trendy " its gotten and no matter how pretty it looks , I doubt a real family can really live on a space dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cushions in a house with children ? I like a mix of browns , blues and whites .. but I could n't phatom an entire white spectrum in a house .. itll feel so cold and even uninviting ( as I 'll be afraid to even sit on a white chair to avoid getting it dirty ) <p> They are beautiful to look at in magazines , but I could not handle living in an all white space ! It would drive me crazy to be constantly worried about how visible dust , smudges , spills , etc. are . Plus , color is just too fun and expressive to live without ! What would I do without peacock blue ? ! <p> As much as I love a white roomIve never been able to reign myself in and avoid color . I 'm making over my sons room and painting three of the walls white ( such an odd feeling ! ! ) , but the 4th wall will have chocolate and orange stripes , so hopefully a good balance ! <p> This is a great question Kate ! I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not work for me in my house at this stage in life . I have white kitchen cupboards and I am constantly wiping off ketchup and mustard fingerprints and black fingerprints from newspapers . I cant imagine having an all white living roomI have other things to do with my time besides wiping fingerprints and washing white slipcovers all the time . I have 2 brown leather sofas in our living room and the kids and the dogs can sit there as much as they want and I do n't  have to wipe up afterwards , or wash , or get cranky with them ! I prefer Sarah Richardsons formula of a neutral background pallette with the color in the furniture and accessories . Wonderful post ! <p> Still cant convince me ! Do n't  mind the ivory shades too much but plain white just looks like the inside of a white-washed out-house . Sorry everyone , it just does to me . AND these people who " swear by white slip covers and bleach " .. they neglect to mention HOW MUCH bleach and HOW MANY WASHES they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? ? NOPE ! Never me . Love all the shades of the rainbow . <p> I like the look of an all white room but I think they really live in the magazine spread dream world . Not in peoples houses who have children or dogs unless you are Jonathan Adler . I 'm sure hed cut you if you messed with an all white room in his home ! <p> I love , love , love an all white kitchen . No matter how many design magazines I look through with kitchen makeovers , I pass over the brightly coloured ones and return to the all white kitchen . I also find white bedrooms to be so calm and serene just as they should be for a good nights sleep . <p> = ( white is a no-no in our house ; 3 cats and a multi-coloured parrot ( and an unreasonable injuction against Roombas from my husband ! ) mean that white would be VERY , VERY difficult to maintain . As much as I dislike brown , most of our furniture is taupe or cafe-au-lait hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it clean with so many kids in the house ? ? ? ? We have reserved a special cat-free guest room , painted white and soft sage green , and I am looking for a comfy bright white pull-out sofa for it to turn it into a reading/guest room as of yet , no luck . <p> I prefer to stick with the white for crown molding , baseboard , and other trim to make a nice punch against the wall coloring . But yeah , all white rooms are the trendy , photgenic stuff of glossy magazines . Real people do n't  live in those spaces . Certainly not real people with children . <p> I am a fan of many shades of white and cream with some color either on the walls or in the accessories . Just stark white is too sterile for me . I hope it will be in vogue for a while though because it is quite lovely . I 'm guessing it is timeless enough to hang in there . <p> Hi Kate , I think white can be timeless , if treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors , and something other than white to rest your eyes upon . Thanks for your ideas , as always , very inspiring . Happy Mothers Day ! <p> As for our furniture , we 've got brown leather couches for the living room and the easily-dirtifiable stuff in the formal where there 's no traffic . The leathers great cos crap seems to buff right off . Sweeeet . <p> From what I 'm gathering , people who have white furniture and kids seem to think that white slipcovers works , whereas the people who are saying white slipcovers would n't work havent necessarily tried them with kids . Since I have been long contemplating white furniture , I 'd love to see some clarification from either side . Has anyone with kids purchased white slipcovers and regretted it ? <p> White rooms are classic , at least in the deep south . My grandparents house was built in the 30s and she had white rooms with colorful accents ( pops of color ) . we were all over her house and furniture as kids . I also use lots of white in upholstery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls to be bright and happy and tone the color with white furnishings and woodwork . Its so much easier to change paint and not so easy to change upholstery or slip covers . I find that white works with kids as long as you do n't  allow them to eat on the furniture . That said , I could have a navy blue sofa and I still would n't let them eat in the living room . Food belongs in the kitchen , dining room or patio . I 've never let them take food to other parts of the housebut , there was that time I found a near-petrified apple core under my daughters bed when she was about six . hahaha . <p> Remember when Wal-Mart came out with revamped packaging for their Great Value store brand ? The mostly white boxes and labels really stood out on the shelves . Clean crisp and classic , but after a while , and if not done right , it just goes back to being boring . <p> For those seeking clarification as to the white slipcovers with children , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sq ft ranch home with 2 children ( now 14 &amp; 12 ) , my hubby , 4 dogs ( 2 100+ lbs ; 2 tiny ) and 11 cats . Yeah , I knowI have issues . <p> I have used slipcovers &amp; throws in red , taupe , brown tweed , grey , &amp; white on my sofa and chairs ; as well as many multi-colored quilts . As it is impossible to keep an army of cats off the furniture , I allow all the dogs on as well . My kids can have food &amp; drinks while on the furniture , because , frankly I felt they couldnt do any worse to it than the animals . <p> My take : The all white slips were by far the most attractiveI loved the look of them . And if you are a NORMAL pet owner , it is super easy to use a tape roll to de-fur the sofa . I did n't  care for dark colors that hid the fur , because everyone is then covered in it . Muddy dog paws have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . As far as the kids were concerned , the white slips were a NIGHTMARE . Even when you do n't  allow them snacks/drinks in the room , you will inevitably have a little boy who has been playing outside all day come in and plop down on the lovely white sofa , leaving multiple smudges of **28;472;TOOLONG cream/candy/lunch/&amp; God-knows-what-else all over the place . My daughter was good for **35;502;TOOLONG . Of course mom is always in the laundry , kitchen or bathroom when the dirty brats start rolling all over the furniture so there is only a slim chance you " ll catch em in time to have them clean up and remove their shoes . White slipcovers do wash up beautifully with bleach . However , REMOVING &amp; REPLACING them is difficult and time consumingthose things do n't  go back on THAT easily . All the tugging , stuffing &amp; adjusting is a real workout . I found I needed to wash them at least once or twice a week ( never less ; often more frequently ) ; several hours of extra work each week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not much better at keeping their feet off the furniture , washing their hands after handling messy things , or keeping pens/pencils/art supplies clear of the furniture . If you have a large enough home to provide your kids with a playroom or study/art and media roomand if your kids are EXCELLENT re : no shoes or food on furniture , and frequent hand washingyou might be happy with white slips . Otherwise you 'll just end up freaking out on the kids all day long , and constantly fussing with your furniture . I think white is best suited to childless households or those with older teens . <p> **If anyone is curious , my best **28;539;TOOLONG furniture solution has been a leather sectional . I do n't  personally care for the look of dark leather furniture ( though my husband and kids love it ) , but it is soooo easy to clean . Pet fur brushes right off , and kid spills , muddy paw prints or doggie slobber I wipe up with cleaning wipes . A little Pledge now and then keeps the leather soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpen their claws on the back and sides of the sofaits getting pretty shredded . But I love my little kitties more than my furniture : ) <p> I could *definitely* live in an all-white housefor a time . I do n't  know that I could ever tire of the look it , but I would maybe grow tired of having to keep it so pristine . And I would certainly feel as though I did n't  match . Could I wear my hand-dyed socks ? Indigo jeans ? The people that I know who have all-white slipcovers and weathered white washed wood seem to forever be in ecru-and-white linen . Even in winter ! <p> I could n't live in a home where every room is white but to have one room say the bedroom or office would work for me . A white room is like sniffing a bowl of coffee beans to clear the senses , its restful and centering . <p> My undergrad degree was in Studio Art and looking at an all white room is like looking at a huge blank canvas . Its just screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair rails , panels/wainscoting and trim , but I need colors in other parts of the room . Otherwise , it feels like a hospital or asylum to me , not enchanting AT ALL . When I think of dreamy and enchanting , I think of a forest with colored leaves , colored lights , and colorfully dressed people . Besides , if you decorate your house in all white , you 're discriminating against all other colors ! <p> I love love all white kitchen . Yes , that 's because I have one . You can accessorize with color and change the color scheme so easily . I have two pictures with lots of colors that just pop with the white background . So bright and cheerful . I have 2 teenagers and a dog not to mention a hubby that never takes his shoes off . You can soft scrub the walls as long as you have matte finish . <p> I have had WHITE slip covers for over 15 years and wrote a post on how to make slipcovers your friend i love my slip covers i had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mass producing like we see today .. but i give a lot of tips on how i bought the fabric and tips on washing .. so check it out .. but i am in love with this whole post as i am a white interior Lover ! ! ! <p> I am LOVING white . I think it is so crisp and fresh and can be translated to any room of the house . I think that , when done correctly , white can still feel as warm and cozy as browns and other rich colors . <p> LOL ! Your caption made me laugh ! Its so true ! There is no way wed be able to keep everything white with a couple of toddlers running around being toddlers . <p> I love the compilation of white interior design you have ! I think the just white look is a bit too much for me and reminds me a lot of an asylum or a hospital because it looks so hygienic . On the other hand , I like the accent colors because it gives it more warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than white in a room because I love so many colors I could just never decide on one or even a few colors to work from so White it was . And as it seems , White it still is . Even after the better part of 30 years living on my own in multiple houses I have still never wondered very far from the love of white , the simplicity of white , the ease of knowing that when I open the can of paint it will be the color I know and love on my walls not some strange thing that has happened at dusk to the paint that I might have chosen . So White will be around for the remainder of my years and like you I like a well grounded room so you will find dark floors or a black piece of furniture thrown in to keep the room from floating away but trendy Never . White will always be a staple in this house at the very least . 23102 @qwx883102

Over the years , I 've been blessed to watch her grow from a toddler to a full grown adult , and all it happened in the blink of an eye . <p> Fortunate for me , as a stepparent , I 've been able to experience so much of what comes with the joys of parenting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with all the promises that she would care for it always , forever and ever , every day . <p> The cat ran away two weeks later , and we never saw it again . <p> But then there was a guinea pig , with all the same promises . <p> And then there was a dog , with all the same promises . <p> Yes , we indulged her , fully aware that we were the ones who 'd care for the family pet most of the time . <p> I 've watched her play multiple seasons and countless hours of sporting events from middle school through her senior year , even carrying her team to the regional championship this year . <p> I 've been there for the homework , the school projects , even the report on Albert Einstein and the accompanying costume . I 've loved watching her spirit and gumption " how she loves to take on new challenges without fear . <p> I watched her bloom over time from a pretty young girl to a teenager with braces . <p> I 've loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play pretend dress up to a beautiful young lady , both inside and out . <p> And after witnessing all of this , you realize as a parent that the child never really belonged to you at all . You were only given the wonderful gift of temporary custody for a brief period of time . <p> I was n't prepared for the series of emotions from the last two days . I 've felt joy , pride , excitement , happiness and sorrow , and I 'm already missing that sweet little girl that forever stole my heart . <p> I am so proud that she is headed off to an incredible university in the fall , but my heart is so heavy with the thought of the empty space in our home . <p> Go make some memories with your child .

It 's become abundantly clear to me that you can never stop time , so you must , without fail , cherish the moments that you are given . <p> You never know what this is like until you 're there . And you realize that this is what you raised them for , but you do n't  want it to end . I know . My oldest daughter got married six weeks ago , and my second , a son , will be leaving for college in 11 days , only two weeks after graduation . But the memories . Does that make us old ? <p> " But the biggest mistake I made is the one that most of us make while doing this . I did not live in the moment enough . This is particularly clear now that the moment is gone , captured only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day , ages six , four , and one . And I wish I could remember what we ate , and what we talked about , and how they sounded , and how they looked when they slept that night . I wish I had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing : dinner , bath , book , bed . I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less " . <p> So beautiful . Im having those exact feelings today as my baby turns 5 today and will go to kindergarten in the fall . I remember when they were all toddlers/babies saying I cant wait until they 're all in school and now that time is hereI can most definitely wait . <p> Exactly ! My son is graduating next weekend . How did this happen ? ! I was just changing his diapers and teaching him to ride a bike . Its good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hard on a Mommys heart . I am definitely a " be in the moment " kind of girl . Thanks for the reminder . Lisa <p> I write as the child , ( well adult since I am 24 now ) . I am the youngest of four and got married last year in October . I was the last child to leave the home , moving 10 hours away . I cant believe how fast time flies . I love my parents unconditionally , they have taught me so many things and gave me unconditional support through every trial in my life . <p> Trust me , your children will always remember all the wonderful things they did for them , especially the little things . Congrats to you for getting your step daughter through high school and raising a beautiful girl ! <p> My daughter will be 28 in a week . She has memories of growing up that overlap with some of mine . Its interesting to compare memory versions of the same incident/time . But I love hearing the ones she remembers , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she loved the two of us sitting out on the patio in the summer snapping two big bowls of green beans from the farmstand . Just snapping beans and talking . It was special to her . You never know what your kids are going to remember . <p> I have a post in draft form about how fast my daughters have grown and I am having such a hard time finishing it as I get too choked up everyttime I work on it . I promised myself I had to do it today as a birthday gift to my husband . He never knows what I am writing about and only sees my posts when he gets them in his e-mail . I know he will love it and I am trying to make it all the more special for him . As of this week we have become official " empty nesters " and it takes some adjusting when you are so used to the house being filled with their presense , laughter , and goings-on . Even writing this note to you telling you about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up way too fast and it is so nice to see how you have enjoyed your stepdaughter throughout the years . You are equally blessed to have your two little ones to enjoy and as you know they are want counts the most in life , nothing else even compares . My best Diane <p> As westerners we are planners and seem to always be planning for the future . A business associate was in from Russia yesterday and was explaining to me that Easterners do n't  do that . They savour the moment , the journey . THis made me think that I shouuld do more of this as well . <p> Made me choke up ! She is beautiful and you must be so proud at all that she has accomplished and all that she is poised to achieve .

I have to admit I constantly fret over the laundry and dishes . This s nice reminder to just absorb and create memories with my kids . <p> As the mom of 6 ( we each had 3 , the oldest being 30 and the youngest 17 ) I feel so very blessed to have been part of it all . I too wish I could have stopped time . Now as the youngest , the only one left at home , talks about his future &amp; what comes next I cant help but wish we could start all over again . <p> My advice : Ask yourself if whatever you are doing will matter in 5 years . If the answer is no then leave it and immerse yourself in the moment , dance in the rain , make forts in the living room , cook together , sing badly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard , listen to their music , get to know their friends .. it all goes too fast &amp; is more precious than anything . <p> I 'm all teary-eyed , even though mine are only 3 and 19 mos , but I still sing a little lullaby to them everytime I put them down that my mom sang to me : " Cleaning and scrubbing can wait til tomorrow , for babies grow up we 've learned to our sorrow , so quiet down cobbwebbs and dust go to sleep , I 'm rocking my baby and babies do n't  keepSuch sweet sentiments about your two daughters <p> kate , this was beautifully written . mine are 2 and 4 and what scares me the most is having to let them go one day . we give them roots and then eventually the wings to fly . but in this scary world , i wish i could keep them close to us forever . <p> All I can say is Thank You .

My son will be 2 next month but I can already picture in my head is graduation day . We all wish time would slow down ! <p> What a beautiful post . My boys are 11 , 8 , and 4 and for some reason I get the most nostalgic watching my youngest . I just do n't  know where the years are gone , but I do cherish every precious moment I have with them . <p> Beautifully written . My son just turned seventeen and went out with the car for the first time yesterday and as he pulled away I thought to myselfseems like just yesterday I was telling him not to eat rocks .

Congrats to you on what appears to be a young woman with poise and confidence . It is such a bittersweet time for parents but oh so exciting for these enthusiastic youngsters . I am filled with dread facing the end of August , when we will set our little bird free , but this is the job we are given as parents . I can only hope her memories are as joy-filled as mine !

I 'm just beginning this journey with my sweet baby boy turning 3 months old last Thursday . I 'm already packing away his newborn clothes ! I think I can relate to what you must have went through some years ago because I 'm also a lawyer and feeling so conflicted about returning to work .

I cant wait to have children one day and make wonderful memories together . : ) <p> This really made me smile , thank you for sharing your thoughts and inner feelings .

" You must have been a beautiful baby , because you turned into a beautiful girl " rings out loud and true for both of you ! not sure if those are correct words but point is the same What a great picture collage . <p> May her walk through life be filled with lush , green , sun-filled valleys , her climbs be on gentle slopes not sharp , rugged mountains and her moccasins always cushion her steps on the path of honor . <p> I stopped by thru a different blog , BNOTP and just had to comment as I celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am reading your post and looking at the pictures it so hit home as to how fast those years have gone . I am very surprised that I was n't more emotional on Saturday but we do the dinner/dance one night and the ceremony at the end of June . I am sure that will be the night reality hits me . So many memories , and so many missed opportunities that I can think ofI do n't  regret anything but wish I had more of a chance to do a few more things that financially werent possible at the timeMy hope for her is that she lives her dreams and she has a wonderful life , however that presents itselfShe knows I will always be there for my baby girl ! ! : ) <p> You totally tweaked my heart with this post .

I get teary-eyed just thinking about it . <p> This is beautiful , so well written . And I feel the same way as a mother myself . You took the words right out of my mouth ! That 's why I 'm a scrapbooker , to preserve the memories because I know I wont remember later . But sometimes I need a reminder , so thanks for giving me one . <p> This is awesome as parents we talk about this , we recognize its importance and we plan to do it but we still let things of less priority steal our attention .

How cool to dedicate a day to celebrating the ladies in your life ! Followed up by a day dedicated to sweethearts . <p> In honor of both days , today 's spotlight is on the color blush pink . I think of it as a neutral , it pairs well with so many colors and looks really lovely with metallics . To avoid the saccharine sweetness attributed to little girls , the trick is to steer clear of bubble gum pink and opt for something that is more muted or closer to pale apricot . <p> Blush pink is soft and romantic , and brings to mind images of rose petals and pale pink peonies . Perfect for creating a retreat in a bedroom with a feminine feel . <p> This is a nice post with nice pictures but I have to say I think I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorite DIY/design blogs and it has just changed so much over the past year .

I got the idea to play around with some copper foil tape I found online , its actually shielding adhesive but I thought it would be fun to craft with it so I ordered a roll from Amazon ( also a roll of slightly thicker gold metallic adhesive tape ) and got creative with both of them . <p> I started with an art project . I liked the shimmer created from these tapes so I made one piece of abstract art using the two tapes , simply layering stripes of them in a random pattern . I really like the use of the copper tape on the framed art on the right to enhance the art inside the white frame . <p> I created a geometric wall treatment too . Using a level I used a pencil to trace the horizontal lines lightly on the wall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random design . I think something similar would look fabulous on a larger scale as an accent wall , or as a detail on the back of a bookcase . <p> Lovely ! I especially like the framed abstract . I have used the copper tape ( more practically , less aesthetically haha ! ) around the bottoms of outdoor planters to discourage snails and slugs from climbing up and partaking of my pretty plants or even around the legs of outdoor furniture . When I lived in coastal LA , the snails were everywhere and would climb everything . It was nice to sit on a cushion and not wonder if I was going to crush a snail . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057591 @3257591/ <h> International Travel with Children <p> By Kate Riley March 7 , 2016 <p> Hi friends ! Today I 'd like to share a few takeaways from our international travel a few months ago , the family globetrotted to Fiji , New Zealand , and Australia for 3+ weeks and had a blast . Traveling for more than a week and with kids can be challenging , you 've got to plan ahead ! Times have changed so much from my two month backpacking trip through Europe in my early twenties when it was- just me but- I had to carry film , maps and a guide book , there was no technology back in the dark ages : ) <p> Passports &amp; Immunizations . This one is obvious but make sure the kids have passports up to date since US passports expire every five years for children under 18 . Many countries require that the passports must not expire for several months after your travel dates as well so factor that time in . I also scanned our passports and emailed myself a copy just in case they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check the travel bureau to see if the country recommends immunizations , and do n't forget to research if the country you 're visiting also requires a travel visa . We found out last minute that Americans need a visa to travel to Australia but thankfully we we 're able to get them within an hour . We felt foolish not knowing that information months in advance so take my advice and check to see if you need a visa before you go ! <p> Pack Ultra Light . Our strategy was one rolling carry on and one backpack per person , that 's it . My kids had to bring independent study homework with them , they also had a book and their school issued iPad they carried in their backpack . Matt and I also had only one carry on piece of luggage and one backpack each . We left a little room it them to pick up souvenirs but I was proud of how lightly we traveled , it helped us quickly move from place to place without spending hours repacking everything . <p> - <p> Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few pairs of shoes and outfits , but one of the smartest things we did was- stay in accommodations every 4 or 5 days with a washer and dryer in the unit . That way I could run a few loads before we repacked and departed to a new destination . Below is a picture from our hotel in Lake Wanaka in New Zealand that offered a washer dryer combo in the bathroom . <p> - <p> Have a Tech Bag . For travel to three countries we needed an adapter , we also rented cars in New Zealand and Australia so a car charger came in handy . I brought my travel camera instead of my bulky DSLR . Another VERY important tool I brought with us were two portable battery rechargers for tablets and phones , they were key ! I carried them in my backpack along with headphones and charging cords so we could keep the phones charged for all day exploring and picture taking . <p> - <p> Have an International Data Plan . Everyone has a smart phone these days but traveling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of time you need an international data plan . To save data while traveling we turned off automatic data roaming and only turned it on when we needed to look up something on a map , that helped the limited data plan last for 3 weeks . <p> Carry an Itinerary . We had so many flights to catch , hotels to check into , and cars to rent , it would have been crazy to try to remember them all or refer to individual email confirmations , so we had one big list with all the details saved on our phone and a hard copy so we knew when we had to be where , which airline , which rental car company , etc . <p> Miniature Everything. - My theory was if I really needed something I could just buy it there so just I just brought the bare minimum a small first aid kit , a clutch that doubled as a jewelry holder , travel size medicines and toiletries , etc . I think I bought sunscreen once but other than that we actually made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> - <p> Extra Fabric Bags . I brought a cute backpack on the trip and would use it for every daily adventure , I 'd fill it with water bottles , sunscreen , phone chargers , my camera and wallet . Equally essential were two rollup fabric bags that I used for everything from beach towels to carrying groceries or separating dirty laundry . They roll up in a tight little ball when not in use and were extremely handy to have during the trip . <p> - <p> Have the Safety Talk . When relevant we reminded the kids about beach dangers and pool rules and what to do if you get separated or lost . Having that conversation kept them aware , on their toes , and following the rules . <p> Limit Eating Out . We stayed in many places with a small kitchen , that saved time and money on a meal because we could grab eggs and pancake mix and fruit at a local store in the evening on arrival , then make a quick breakfast in the morning in the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically pop into a cafe or store to grab a few things to nibble on , we 'd carry snacks with us during the day , and then after a day of adventure we 'd pick a place to sit down for dinner , that approach worked well . <p> Balance Adventure with Relaxation . There was a lot we wanted to see with the limited days we had but there were a few times that we decided to sleep in or spend time by the pool or an afternoon at the beach instead of spending all day running around and that really helped keep us sane having equal parts relaxation time as well as adventure time . We had a really enjoyable trip and made so many memories , ones I 'm sure they 'll recall with great fondness when they 're older . <p> - <p> A few additional- notes <p> Consider booking attractions ahead . Many adventures we 'd book a day or two in advance but several we booked weeks in advance ( like the animal encounters at the Australia Zoo ) . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got tickets ahead of time . <p> Notify credit card companies where you 're traveling to avoid having your card frozen when you need to use it ! <p> And also prepare for jetlag . When we flew from California to Fiji it was a red eye flight so we slept on the plane as much as we could and when we arrived it was early morning so it was n't bad . On the way back it was harder since we flew during the day then into the night and when we arrived it was morning in California so we had to stay up as much as possible that day to get back on pacific standard time . It took a few days to feel normal again but we did recover . <p> So fellow jetsetters , what about you ? What are your tips for international travel or extended trips ? How to do entertain your kids while traveling on planes , trains , and automobiles ? <h> 25 comments <p> HI Kate I ejoyed your post and have a question for you about your travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too big to take when travelling lightly , so could you kindly share what your travel camera is ? Thanks . <p> It sounds like everybody had a wonderful vacation ! As parents to 5 kids we try to do some international travel mixed in with domestic travel . In May of 2015 we took the kids out of school for 10 days in May ( BEST time to go ) to do the Zion , Bryce , Hoover Dam , Grand Canyon , etc route ) . Two years prior we did France for 10 days . Next trip will be in 2017 and will either be Greece or Italy . I am a NP and we often refer to the CDC website for vaccinations update both for kids and international travel . You can just put in your destination ( s ) and it will come back with recommendations for vaccines . Also : LONG ... is a great resource to check to see if your country requires a visa . Love your blog ! ! <p> We have n't traveled very far with our kids yet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting until they are old enough it is less stressful to travel , and they can also fully enjoy things ! This was very helpful , for when we do though ! <p> I do a good bit of business travel . here 's my tip for keeping track of flights , hotel and car reservations . Enter the details from each email confirmation in a calendar event on the appropriate day . It will be easy to find and open the relevant details on your smart phone . For me , this is more convenient than a single document . <p> Kate , what an organized mind you have , I need to take notes since my family and I have been globe trotters mostly by need not pleasure I come from Romania , Eastern Europe , my hubby is Colombian and we both went to grad school Switzerland . Then our jobs took us to Berkeley , CA for two years and now we moved again near Chicago , Illinois so whenever we want to see our families , we must travel thousand of miles and I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now 4 ) on such long distances is NO FUN . My daughter was 6 months old when we first travelled with her from Switzerland to Colombia , and I still have nightmares about it ! <p> We are leaving on our 4th international trip with our kids in a few weeks . They are now 13 &amp; 17 , and , in many ways , are more flexible travelers than their parents ! Every family dynamic is different , but do n't  underestimate your childrens abilities to handle a long-distance adventure . If they can get on a plane to fly to Disney , they can travel elsewhere ! ! ! I can second much of what Kate has said : pack light and make each child responsible for their own stuff ; limit one roller bag and one carry-on for each person ; just pay to ship it e.g. if you purchase a handbag in Europe or pottery in Portugal , have it shipped home by the time you arrive home , that 35 euros is n't going to seem like a lot compared with lugging your new purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; always book ahead for certain locales &amp; attractions if you know that you are going to want to do something , get those tickets ASAP ! ; research , research , research what you do before-hand and try to avoid doing everything touristy we always see something cultural , e.g. the opera , theatre , etc , and stick to what the locals are buying tickets to ; consider a driver and guide for the day it can be expensive , but we have come away with some of our best memories on these days ( budget other ways like on Kates examples with food ) ; consider staying in apartment rentals we rarely travel any other way now and find one in a neighborhood that interests you ; take the red-eye and do n't  go to bed until it is dark at your destination ; have a plan for if you get separated we always make sure our kids have the address of where we are staying and the number for the person we are renting from , and we designate one family member not traveling with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our childrens cell phones as well but limit their use to emergencies ; push your comfort zone a bit why fly half way around the world to just sit by the pool ? ; teach your kids " hello " and " thank you " in the language of the country you are visiting ; and , last , but not least , do n't  be afraid to get a little lost . <p> This whole post is brilliant . Great idea on the fabric bags ! When we were in France , we shopped at local markets for food for meals , but guess what ? They do n't  even offer sacks in which to carry your groceriesan obvious oversight on our part . We felt pretty awkward trying to balance our purchases without sacks . Ill be sure to pack fabric sacks next time ! <p> Great post Kate ! One of my tips is what I call " finding your Eiffel Tower " . When we planned our Paris vacation , everyone got to pick their one must do and we made sure to do each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she wanted to go up the Eiffel Tower , I wanted to have a meal at a restaurant I last visited on our honeymoon , my husband wanted to visit his favourite tea shop . Usually its the adults planning the itinerary so making sure each person has a memory that is theirs makes the trip that more special . <p> We traveled a lot internationally with the kids when they were little and we still do now that they are adults ! We spent 3 weeks in New Zealand over Christmas this year . One little tip that we used when traveling with them , when they were young was to grab a sheet of notepaper or a business card at the hotel that we were staying at and slip it into their pocket . That way if they got separated from us they would be able to tell authorities where we were staying . When you are traveling a lot , kids often have no idea of the hotel name and address ! Thankfully , we never had to test it out but I felt better knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weve travelled pretty extensively with our two children who are four and eight . Its a passion of ours and something we like to do together regardless of their age . We do our best to include them in the planning , from where we stay to what we see and do . It gets them involved and they are excited about trip . This year we are off on our second trip to Europe and will be visiting Copenhagen . The kids are busy planning their Lego purchases ! <p> My four year old son is also a diabetic so it certainly takes a lot of planning to ensure everything runs smoothly . <p> When we return , I always print our travel pictures into a photobook . They sit on the coffee table and we like to look through them often . It certainly helps them remember and tell stories of their adventures . <p> My family travels overseas every year as our mothers and siblings are spread out across five continents . <p> A few things that help us 1 . Securely storing electronic copies of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . 2 . When our kids were younger , we would dress in the same color shirts if we were going sightseeing , to help them find me easily . 3 . Taking a picture of the kids every morning before we go out . Also , placing a small card in their pockets with mom and dads contact info , hotel info , etc. should we get separated . By the grace of God we 've never had need for these ! 4 . Discussing food safety with the kids . They are now great travelers with adventurous palates and know to exercise wisdom in consuming water , street food , etc. 5 . Try to book long haul flights for the evening when they would be sleeping anyway . 6 . Over the years I 've also developed a packing list and just hand each kid one , then I check suitcases before we leave . 7 . Packing cubes are invaluable we typically go for three weeks at a time and are often in multiple cities , so having clothing sorted by type saves us from having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack a weeks worth of clothing + special items then drop them off to be laundered every few days saves us from having to lug so many clothes . I also carry small quantities of detergent , etc for situations where we do our own laundry . 9 . Upon returning home , toiletries and other products are replenished so we are ready for the next trip . : - ) <p> I am leaving for Cuba in 5 weeks . I will have to do that rolling luggage and backpack for my son . Since this is an educational trip we are going to 5 cities in 9 days . Man I cant believe I did n't  think of that now the toilet paper can stay in the book bag ! ! ! <p> We 've traveled a lot with our son , who is now 7 . We went to Japan last summer as his first international trip , and it was amazing ! My tip with international travel is to pick somewhere that your child is interested in as well . Our son loves ninjas , trains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus , we 've been there before pre-kid , so we knew our way around a bit ) . He was tired of shrines and temples by the end of the trip , but the promise of a little Pokemon toy powered him through it . <p> Such great tips ! We do n't  have any kiddos yet , but once we do we plan on making travel a regular part of their lives . I took my first international trip with I was 9 and loved it , so I hope to do the same . <p> I especially love your tip for making breakfast for yourself rather than eating out ! What a great way to save money for other fun things . 23102 @qwx883102

I was introduced to- Ave Home and their collection of raw furniture and was excited to see their furniture- in its- raw state allows anyone to- tailor it to their- individual preference . This desk is the first of three pieces I 'll be finishing and featuring this year . <p> The first piece I was drawn to was the Colette Desk I 've needed a new desk for my office and this- one with its classic French style appealed to me . It arrived via freight then I unpackaged it to get started on painting it . <p> - <p> When it arrived in its raw wood state I- chose to paint it with a classic white and gold combination , keeping the surface and fluted legs white and gilding the egg and dart detail and also the hardware . <p> - <p> - <p> I used Annie Sloan Chalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface with a coat of clear wax ( I apply it with a rag then buff it ) . <p> - <p> - <p> For the gilding I used two products that work well , Liquid Leaf in Brass ' for the egg and dart molding and Gold Leaf spray paint on the hardware . <p> - <p> - <p> I shopped my house for a more classic decor with which to style it , including paintings purchased on my European travels and a crystal lamp from my master bedroom . <p> - <p> I love that this desk is finished on all sides , including the back , not all desks offer this feature and it 's a welcome detail for when this piece finds its new home in my office because the back of the desk will face the entrance . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> I chose white for my own home but I 'd love to see this piece in a pale pastel pink with gold detail or a deep charcoal or glossy black . <p> This project brought to you in partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or designer who seeks quality furniture pieces to personalize for their clients or their home . All opinions are my own . <h> 10 comments <p> Beautiful desk ! Looked into the company and found several items I would love to have , and I actually started to order a piece until it got to the shipping charges totally out of hand . Almost half the cost of the item . Sadly , I will not be ordering anything . <p> This turned out lovely ! Very nice work . However , this furniture is very pricy , especially when you add on shipping . I 'd rather get mine second or third hand anyway . In my experience , the quality is so much better and they are always way cheaper than this . <p> That desk is stunning Kate ! You always do everything beautifully ! I love the white with the gold . Classic with a touch of glitz and glam ! I finished a dresser recently that I did in a soft ballet pink with gold accents . Have a great week ! <p> Agree with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you did with the desk . Just beautiful ! When I went to look at their website however , the item cost + shipping seems cost prohibitive for the average DIYer . I 'll keep looking at thrift shops and antique stores for cool pieces I can tweak a little or paint ! Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> I agree with others as well . Kate always does an amazing job with makeovers . But for me , I mostly do projects because of the cost savings vs. buying full retail , and the recycling aspect . The creativity is part of it , but my finishes never look as professional if I bought the pieces , and my time is valuable , so I only do it if I 'm saving considerably ( i.e. Thrift shop or free pieces ) , and feeling good about saving something from a dumpster . Still- Love the inspiration , Kate ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057597 @3257597/ <h> Day Trip : Yountville <p> Matt and I spent all day Saturday working on some home improvement projects so we dedicated Sunday to a day of leisure and headed out to Napa County to spend the day at a favorite town , Yountville . <p> Yountville is a small town near the big wineries in the Napa Valley it was made famous by Thomas Keller when he founded the French Laundry almost 20 years ago . Keller expanded his restaurants on Washington Street to include bistro Bouchon , the Bouchon Bakery next door , and casual Ad Hoc down the street . To tempt taste buds even more , a few years ago chef Michael Chiarello opened Bottega next to his flagship Napa Style store . All of the restaurants are within a few hundred yards of each other which certifies Yountville as foodie heaven . <p> Yountville is a very small town , and most businesses , shops , restaurants and tasting rooms are located along the main street ( Washington ) .

We chose Bottega this time and it was divine ! <p> After lunch it 's time for a stroll ! Take a walk down Washington Street past roses , lavender , and other flowering plants and you 'll come to the unfenced gardens of the French Laundry where it 's perfectly fine to walk around and admire the organic gardens of fruits and vegetables growing in the sun . <p> Keep going and you 'll come to several tasting rooms along Washington Street where you can sample a variety of wines and browse a few art installations too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods a glance at some pretty cottages and homes in the neighborhood . <p> If you 're traveling with kids , there 's a wonderful park and play structure on the corner of Washington and Jackson . If not , there 's a bike tour company in downtown Yountville ( Napa Valley Bike Tours ) where you can rent bikes to head to the big wineries of Oakville and Rutherford a few miles north , or you can walk from downtown over to Domaine Chandon to enjoy the afternoon picnicking and drinking sparkling wine . <p> On your next trip to the Napa Valley , spend a day in Yountville , your taste buds wo n't be disappointed ! <p> OOOh Thanks for posting these awesome pics ! I live in Vacaville , so it is always fun feeling like I 'm reading posts from someone in my own back yard .

We visited about a dozen years agopretty much did the 7 sisters B&amp;B thing up the coast . Loved French Laundry ! In fact , I often tell people the best meals I 've ever eaten have been in Napa . I have always lived in NY and have eaten at some pretty fancy smancy places , but nothing can compare to the freshness of the ingredients in California . Ill never forget the taste of a REAL peach while I was there . Thanks for the trip down memory lane . <p> We just visited there this past Friday ( just a couple of days before you ! ) and I fell in love with Yountville .

@@99057598 @3257598/ <h> Decorating with Complementary Colors <p> By Kate Riley February 19 , 2015 <p> I enrolled in a Color Theory class years ago and it taught me so much , and one of the classroom assignments was to paint a canvas using only complementary colors . It was challenging but I was surprised how well that mini still life of yellow pears and lavender stems turned out ! I find color theory fascinating , and love to study what works and what does n't , especially from the best designers and experts . With spring on its way , many crave more colorful accents indoors , here 's a color rule to help pull it off . <p> Decorating with complementary colors is based on the simple principle that opposites attract and in turn enhance . Complementary colors are those that are directly across from each other on the color wheel , red and green , blue and orange , etc . <p> A few weeks ago I wrote about decorating with monochromatic color which is always a sure bet , however one way to energize a monochromatic space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange sit across from each other , and since aqua and coral continue to be popular hues in home decor , it works well to blend the two . A series of blue patterns are at play in this casual yet elegant living room ; the touch of coral in the artwork and accent pillows spices it up . <p> Red is the complement of green , but pink counts as it 's a paler version of red . I love a great deep pink and vivid green medley , raspberry is very fresh when paired with lime or apple green , deeper emerald and Kelly greens . <p> Purple and yellow are opposites on the color wheel , pastel hues like lavender and pale yellow feel perfectly at home in a girl 's room ; aubergine and saffron are more mature and lend a global or Old World feel , especially with metallic sheens mixed in . <p> If you have a space dominated by one color , consider introducing its complement to invigorate , spaces are energized when complements collide ! What about you ? Have you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments <p> I love using the color wheel ! I am so attracted to those bright colors right now . It feels like a breath of fresh air , and not the freezing cold kind so many of us are experiencing right now . My master is going to have touches of teal and bright pink . I cant wait to start on it . Thanks for the inspiration . I really also love the purple and gold . <p> When choosing complementary colors , is it important to choose colors within the same hue ? Or does that really matter ? IE : Could I use raspberry pink with a very light green ? ? Or preferably a bolder green ? <p> Great question Chrissy . If the complementary colors are pure or saturated then they can pair with each other regardless of tint so a bright raspberry would look wonderful with a pure light or a dark green . What 's interesting is when you mix the pigment of direct complements , they begin to muddy each other ( or become more gray and muted ) which leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorating with split complements , where you would mix one color with the colors analogous to its direct complement ( the ones that sit next to it ) and that 's a really fun medley too . <p> Decorating with rich plum and vibrant citron yellow is my absolutely favorite look . There is something so unexpected about the combination . I 'm not quite sure I could convince my fiance to go for this look in our family room but maybe touches of color in the master bedroom or guest bedroom . Ahh future house plans . <p> Hi Mary . Gray is a neutral between black and white , with pigment it can lean in a certain color direction ( blue , green , lavender ) but its not considered a color for purposes of comparing complements . However , be happy that every color looks wonderful with gray ! <p> Wonderful article and always like working with the colorwheel when I decorate but I 'm a little stumped with something right now . I bought these beautiful curtains that I just love in a seaglass color but they turn colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more blue in the evening . I 'm wanting to find a color that will complement both colors for my wall but am stumped on which way to go . Grey seemed the natural choice , already have some bold blues in the room with furniture and a big brown leather couch that I call the big dark hole , I want something light and airy to complement the curtainsHELP ? I 'm stumped ! <p> Hi Kelly , I 'd add a neutral paint color in a similar blue with gray undertones , in an analogous color ( gray green ) or go for the complement across from a bluish green a soft apricot ( lighter version of coral ) . Try a bunch of samples so you can see how they work with your curtains with the changing light . <p> Color theory is fascinating . It is also confusing to me . I would rather take my color inspiration from a season , a painting , a fabric . Fall colors are my favorite but yet the color wheel does not group them together in any way . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors ? Great article , I hope you do more of them . I second the show us the painting comment . Have a great weekend ! P.S. I voted for you , I hope you when you most certainly deserve it . <p> This information is so interesting , and so useful to me as I work through redecorating my living room . The bright blue draperies are breathtaking . I did n't  realize what a dramatic impact your window treatments can have on the whole feel of a room until I renovated mine . I used a blinds company in royal oak and I could n't be happier <p> I took a color theory class in college and the lesson that has stuck with me the most is how colors impact each other . We had an assignment to cut holes in pieces of colored paper ( like paint swatches ) and place those over other color swatches to see how they changed each other . I still do that little exercise ( sort of ! ) when considering whether to use two colors together ! 23102 @qwx883102

I love all of the flowers and fresh bread looks delightful . <p> oooohhh spring is in the air ! love farmers markets and we have a great one within minutes from us. the purple sprouting broccoli caught my eyehow unusual and something i would def try . love the organic breads toocant get enough of that ! great pics too ! judi ; ) <p> Kate , which farmers market is this ? We occasionally make it over to your neck of the woods from Sac on weekends . I 'd love to know where this market is in case it works with our travels . Gorgeous produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would positively flip to visit a market with such lovelies ! ! Its been a while since I 've beenlive in a suburb and its a bit of a drive to one of decent size , but I do n't  think it would qualify as a great one . Maybe I 'll have to check it out again . Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> Ohhh it all looks so yummy ! ! Our farmers market wont have anything like that for a few months yet .. too cold up here in the frozen north-nothing has even been planted yet : - ( I cant wait until I can start buying ! ! <p> Wow fabulous pics of the Farmers Market ! ! When we lived in Monterey , CA one of my favorite things was the awesome Farmers Market on Thursday mornings ! ! One of the best Ive been around still ! Happy Spring to all ! <p> The purple broccoli rapini is so vibrant , so delicious one of my favourite and photogenic too . Do n't  start me on the lilac . I would n't leave that market without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its time to research the net and see when the local farmers markets open here . I 'm very curious about your project .

@@99057602 @3257602/ <h> Chopped Salad , Three Ways <p> By Kate Riley August 11 , 2015 <p> Last year I vowed to change the way I eat . 20 pounds had crept up on me and I knew a lot of that came from lazy eating habits . Instead of picking a specific diet I simply decided to eat clean instead . I do not obsessively count calories , I hate feeling hungry so I never ever skip meals , but I do watch pretty carefully what I eat each day and for me the main rule is the food has to be as close to natural as possible . I wo n't give up chocolate and red wine but both clean eating and consistent exercise has given me more energy and I 've stuck with it for a year , dropped the weight , and I 'm feeling better than ever . <p> With my clean eating manifesto comes a lot of salads . A LOT . And like with exercise you can totally plateau and become extremely bored . Lettuce , let 's face it , you 're drab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the toppings but I was even growing bored with my go-to favorites , so last week I switched things up with a kitchen gadget that 's helping me love salads again . <p> I 've been to a few restaurants and even Subway that offer a chopped salad and I wanted to be able to do it myself at home so I ordered this bowl and chopper combo . I 'm hooked ! <p> This tool is cool , you layer the bigger tougher ingredients on top of the lettuce and chop away . <p> Next , add the more delicate or softer ingredients . <p> Drizzle your dressing ( blue cheese or ranch ) and toss . <p> A classic chopped cobb salad , hello lunch . <p> So instead of stabbing the salad with your fork it 's more like scooping and that small difference makes the salad taste better in my opinion . More little morsels in each bite . ( That plate is vintage Tar-jay , seen here in 2011 ) . <p> This may be obvious for many of you but do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know this until a year ago when my brother Nate the amazing cook showed me because he felt sorry for me watching me do it wrong . It was a light bulb moment and also embarrassing since I 've lived in California all my life where avocados are like condiments , they 're served with practically everything. - #spoiledinsunnyCA <p> Anyway it 's simple , cut the avocado in half , remove the pit by stabbing with bottom of knife blade in a quick motion ( or carefully spooning out ) . Place each half upside down on a cutting board , slice it down the middle , then peel back the skin . Slice thinly and serve . <h> 29 comments <p> We have this bowl and chopper and LOVE it ! I actually use a spoon to eat my salad now . LOL ! THe only issue is that if you make a chopped salad for two people , you both better like all the ingredients . No picking out an offending cucumber or olive . : ) <p> A giant salad is definitely one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a version with roast chicken from the store ( and use any leftover meat for more salads/burritos later in the week ) , a little bit of taco seasoning , and I make the dressing by combining ranch , salsa , some lime juice and cilantro chopped fine . A few bits of tortilla chips make it even better . Thanks for the avocado tip , I always use a big spoon but this looks way easier ! : ) <p> You do n't  need to peel an avocado at all just remove the stone and slice with a butter knife right in the skin . Then squeeze the slices out . Done ! If you want absolutely perfect slices then your brothers way might be better , but if you want the avo out of the skin and into the bowl , do my way ! <p> How timely ! I was just telling my husband yesterday , " There comes a time in every womans life where she needs to eat salad for lunch . At least there does for this woman . " These salads all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bought one ! My husband has lots of pre-prepared unappetising salad bowls for lunch but I could make us both a healthy and varied one now . Well timed blog post , I was just thinking about how I could eat better ! ! Thank you ! <p> All faves , but I do n't  chop as small.I think I might eat faster if I did ! Suggest Ni+oise style : add a can of tuna to the olives/egg/red onion/tomato . I also am still on the kale kick . I chop freshly washed kale and keep it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator , with some olive oil and a light splash of sesame oil . Kale can be tough and generally unpleasant , but I 've found the oil softens it up . I grab a handful each day I take my lunch to work , all the chopped ingredients on top and its done . The juices from the various ingredients flavor the salad , Ive gotten away from high fat , sugar-loaded bottled dressings and havent missed them . <p> Great suggestions ! ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing in a big bowl and then serve , I hate when I 'm at a restaurant and the salad is n't tossed ! ! You use much less dressing this way and its just better . 23102 @qwx883102

The workshop is packed with motivation , inspiration , and most importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all and just in time for back to school . Here 's a sneak peek 2 minute video that gives you the skinny on what you can expect in this workshop . <p> Spread out over six weeks , you 'll have plenty of time to review the materials that provide answers to your pressing organizational issues . You 're free to review the weekly materials on your own time over the six weeks , online or in PDF format , or even in MP3 format . <p> 2 ) For a second chance to win , either link to this giveaway on Facebook OR tweet this giveaway with a link on Twitter , and then leave a second comment telling me where you mentioned this giveaway ( FB or Twitter ) . <p> I need to win this in the worst way ! My most challenging area is my laundry room . Its where everyone comes in from the garage , and drops everything , papers , shoes , backpacks , nevermind the laundry ! Everytime I think I 'm going to go in there and organize I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge is what to do with/where to put/what to get rid of when it comes to out-of-season stuff ! This includes seasonal decorations and seasonal clothing for myself and my kiddies . We have a small apartment with very VERY little storage space . Most of our out-of-season stuff gets put in boxes under my bed only to be forgotten the next time its needed . <p> Love , love , love anything that helps me get more organized . I do pretty well most of the time , but sometimes things tend to fall apart . My biggest challenge is the little stuff the stuff I seem to move from place to place because I ca n't figure out where it really needs to live . <p> My biggest organizational challenge is our lack of utility storage . We live in a tiny apartment with very little closet space and no garage . Finding a home for the camping equipment means displacing off-season clothing storage , or the like . <p> Oh I need to win this . Where do I begin . My kitchen pantry . I try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea where anything is ? The next spot is my basement . We have a storage room that just seems cluttered all the time . <p> Paper is my biggest organizational challenge . I homeschool my children . Just trying to keep up with my records and their paperwork is daunting . Add to that their co-op classes and projects and we have a real mess . Then there is my household paperwork . We have a paper monster . <p> Hmmm , I am organizationally challenged in so many ways it is hard to pick one ! But I have to say the garage . It is constantly getting filled up with boxes waiting to be broken down , stuff waiting to go to the consignment store , my kids toys , on and on . But the worst part is that I walk through it many times a day to get out to the car , so I am constantly reminded of what a holy terror it is ! <p> Pick me , pick me ! My biggest challenge would have to be my hobbies and craft stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pantry , where only half of the space is actually used for food . Then some is in my bedroom , where the sewing machine is . And some is in our home office , because there is shelf space there . So I guess that 's actually a bunch of organizational challenges in one ! I especially need to get the craft stuff organized so I can separate out the stuff for my Girl Scouts from my familys projects . I so need this ! <p> Yikes ! Where to start ? I hate clutter and I have too much stuff . Right now my two problem areas are my kitchen and my basement which is so full of " stuff " that we have paths that we walk through to get to what we really need . I have trouble letting go of some things I should just let go of and move on . I 'd love to be able to participate in this workshop ! Thanks ! <p> Piles , piles , piles ! They are everywhere . On any horizontal surface the floor , the entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just about any place else I can think up . I need storage solutions for every room of my house and would love to win this ! ! ! <p> My biggest organization challenge ? Getting everyone else in the house to put things back where they found them , I cant tell you how many times I go to get frog tape , scissors , etc. , and they are n't  were I put them last ! Janell <p> here 's my current organizational challenge : I recently staged my house to sell it cleared out a ton of stuff , took away furniture , took down some of my organizational staples and then decided to stay in our house . Now I have to reintegrate some of the stuff , but not all , because it turns out that I love the new , clearer look of the house . But with two kids in school , and their hobbies , and parental hobbies how do I keep the clearer look while getting the organizational punch I used to have ? Thanks for the great giveaways ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are organized , but in the beginning of September , I will be moving into a tiny 330 square foot studio apartment that I know I am going to have a hard time organizing ! <p> I have the worst time with JUNK DRAWERS ! No matter how many little basket you put in them , there are always things that need to be put away , and it seems I can never keep up with them . Little game pieces , parts and screws I may or may not ever need again , batteries , markers , padlocks .. aaaah ! You get it . And I think they multiply like bunnies everytime I walk away from the drawer . PLEASE ! ! ! HELP ! : ) <p> There are lots of areas in my house that need organization . At the moment , its my crafting area that needs the help . My husband says I should just get rid of 3/4 of the " stuff " . However , that 's not solving the root problem , is it ? : ) <p> Never have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need help organizing my scrapbook space . I need a way to find what I need in my stash so I can spend more time scrapbooking and less time hunting through my supplies . <p> I actually love the task of organizing ( believe it or not ) but it seems that I always fail with the office paper and the random little pieces of things that you never know what to do with . I am excited about this giveaway ! <p> This is a tough one.I am so disorganized with anything that has a door or drawer . The house looks great , clean , organized , but if you DARE to open a closet or a drawer .. MESS ! Would love the chance ! Thanks <p> My biggest struggle is keeping my desk in my classroom organized . The school day is insanely busy . I am in front of kids for 6 1/2 hours and as soon as they leave , I 'm off to meetings until its time to go home . The papers pile up fast ! <p> An 8 month old baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 bedroom apartment . My entire life is an organizational challenge . : ) Although I guess my linen closet would be the primary concern . Things fall out when you open it . <p> Wow so many challenges to getting organized . My biggest challenge is my computer/work area at home . It seems to pile up and it is in the kids playroom so it get covered with their stuff also . Plus it is where my craft supplies are kept . Need I go on ? <p> This giveaway just came at the right time . I 'm the process of organizing and cleaning out our home office . I swear you ca n't walk to open the window there is stuff everywhere . I need someone to help me how to maintain it organized and clean when we are running in and out of the house . I know that this giveaway will help me organize the rest of my home . <p> My biggest organizational challenge would be my scrapbook room . I have collected a LOT of supplies over the years and am ready to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything better . <p> My biggest organizational challenge would simply be to find the time to do everything I want in a week between work , planning and preparing meals and keeping the house clean I feel like I never have time for the things I want to do ( play piano , watch Gossip Girl on DVD , read ) and we do n't  even have kids yet ! Would love some help in this area : ) <p> Oh my ! ! I would love this opportunity ! My office is a disaster area and is home to such random items- toys , files , dead plants , Christmas gifts ! I really need a push to get organized and create a vision for this room ! ! <p> What a practical giveaway thatll keep on giving ! My master br needs the most help . With 6 kids I often put my room , closets and bathroom on the backburner to make sure that the kids rooms are organized and clean . If company is coming over , the excess stuff gets stashed in my room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow what a great giveaway ! I LOVE to be organized but live with unorganized people ! And then I give up because you cant do it all alone . So I guess I pick everywhere my kids leave stuff their rooms , the entry , the playroom guess that 's more than one ! <p> This contest comes at the perfect time for me . I have been organizing my financial paperwork and just last night I watched Suze Ormans Women and Money DVD to get inspired . She emphasizes that one of the qualities that wealthy women posses is cleanliness . I 'd love to enroll in this workshop , because I feel like I have tamed my financial paperwork , but I 'd like to set-up systems to make organizing the rest of my life simpler ! <p> My biggest challenge is the everyday clutter . IT seems like I can find time to organize , but keeping it up another story . Everything seems to end up on the counter in the kitchen or the desk there or just urgh you get the idea . <p> My biggest organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed everything we could into them and slammed the door so we looked unpacked . Six months later , that 's proving to have been a bit of a mistake <p> Wow , what a great and practical giveaway ! What Mom couldnt use something like this ? <p> For me one of the biggest challenges is just keeping on top of the basic home administrative stuff . Things like clearing out my letter tray , putting those medical receipts in the right place , sorting the receipts that need saving , following up on the many sticky note reminders on my desk , etc , etc , etc . <p> Not to mention just getting random little things back to their home . It might be a bottle of nail polish that was left out , or that single sock sitting on the floor , or putting that book back in the shelf , getting the shoes put away on the rack . Just little things that really are n't  a huge dealthat is until they all pile up , and voila , you have a mess on your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thisit would be so interesting to hear the advice of a professional . I always try to START out organized , but my problems come when we have a busy few weeks , and the systems Ive set up fall by the wayside . And , of course paper pile up does n't  help , since I hate filing things ! <p> I just moved from a tiny apartment into a 3-story house . I 'm nowhere near unpacked and have no idea where to begin ! I have always been disorganized . You could never find the floor or furniture in my apartment because it was always covered in stuff . Now I 'm terrified that I wont be able to keep the new house organized . And I really want my kids to grow up in an organized environment and learn good organizational skills for the future ! I want to be a good role model for them so they do n't  end up like this when they grow up ! <p> I 'm entering on behalf of my mom . I live out of state and wish I could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clutter while working full-time , caring for my grandmother before she died , and having to settle estates for several relatives . She always gives so much of herself but is practically buried under stuff they 've accumulated as a result of helping others . Thanks for the opportunity ! <p> As a busy pastors wife , homeschool mom of six , and part-time freelance writer , I need all the organizational help I can get ! I 'd love to be entered . I will also post this on my FB for a second chance . Thanks so much , Amy OQuinn/picketfencemom <p> It is my desk . Not just my desk at home but also the one in my classroom . I get it all neat and clean and the next thing I know there is just a pille of stuff on it by the end of the day . Thanks for the chance to win . <p> Oh , how much i need this ! As an author I write from my home office where i find that slowly the household clutter has crept up on me almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for creativity ? Help ! I need structure , organizing . Will you save me and release Ms Muse my creativity again ? <p> Oh , I am so frustrated with all the papers , coupons , receipts , etc .. they just sit in piles ! Like I have two vouchers for an airline ticket.and it sits on my dresser , because I do n't  know what to do with stuff like that ! I 'd love this ! Suzanne <p> What a great giveaway I need this for sure ! I am constantly trying to get organized , but I have so much trouble actually STAYING organized . With two little girls ( 13 months and 28 months ) I feel like the toys are always all over the place , spilling from one room into another . The second I get them neatly sorted , its a mess again please help ! ! ! <p> My biggest challenge ? The whole house ! My husband is a pack rat extraordinaire . He is at home all day while I work , so I come home to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't totally destroyed is my kitchen , because he does n't  cook much . Help ! ! ! <p> My biggest organizational challenge is my kitchen . I love to cook and have LOTS of pots , pans , utensils etc . But my kitchen has very limited space , so I 'm always knocking something over or fishing through the cabinets in hopes of finding the item I need . Its a bit frustrating , so I would love tips , advice , and ideas on how to make it more functional . Thanks so much ! <p> My biggest challenge would have to be keeping track of all the paperwork that comes into the house how to sort , store and maintain it all usually results in a huge pile on the kitchen bench ! I could do with some help , so thanks for hosting such a worthwhile giveaway I have my fingers crossed ! K xx <p> Pick just one challenge ? ? The paper and " things " that come into the house each day with 3 busy boys especially now as we are temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutter is compressed into smaller space . <p> I would LOVE to win this My biggest struggle is living with a family member who has ADHD . This person is now a successful adult , but we face considerable challenges in keeping our homeand thus our lives organized and under some degree of control . For many , many years ( especially while my children were very young ) , our home was chaotic and chock-a-block , which was NOT condusive to our emotional well-being . Things have improved since I began making a sincere effort to de-clutter , and find places for the important things we use on a regular basis . However , I have been trying to do all of this on my own , and the mammoth task often feels as though it is going to be too much for me . <p> As a teacher , I understand how valuable it can be to create a structured , predictable environment for my family . However , I am struggling to establish and maintain order , while showing others in my household how important it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to participate in this workshop would give me the encouragement I need to keep moving forward , as well as the skills to make a well-ordered , comfortable home a reality . I sincerely believe that it would help my family members , too . <p> my biggest challenge is TMI ( too much info ) in the form of clippings , files , info etc .. too many interests and so many " tear sheets " for the style files , binders , etc that I still have not gotten around to . Add to that memorabilia , BIble studies , photos .. the decluttering DOES take time and DECISIONS ! waht if something happens to me before I get it all " together ? " EEEEEEKKKKK ! I just do n't  stay HOME long enuff to just DO IT ! <p> My biggest challenge hmm . It is either my office ( I am a department head with two assistants and not nearly enough time ) or having moved into a much smaller home . My sons room is not unpacked due to being one-third the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home to work through it . I am an avid crafter with no crafting space . What do I do ? ! <p> My toughest organization problem is the office/playroom . With the constant build up of paper combined with the daily toy explosion of two little boys , it gets a bit chaotic . I would LOVE some new ideas , tips , or tricks to tame the clutter : ) <p> My biggest organizatin challenge is living in a small 2 bedroom apartment with a one year old myself and my husband . We have so much stuff and so few closets that everything just piles up . there is not enough space , and I have recently started a crfting " business " so now I need to find a space for that as well . <p> I live with my husband , our 14mo old daughter , two dogs and two cats in a 1200 sqft. home . I am due with our 2nd baby in Nov . I love to organize , and you would think with a smaller home , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for storage that I 'm struggling to find places to store my stuff . I hate hoarding and I am not a packrat , so my challenge is every room because I have come to believe that there is NO room left to move into . Our bedroom closet is n't even dep enough on one side to fit a shoebox in lengthwise ( and being a **25;569;TOOLONG , I keep my shoes in their boxes ) . I 'd love to learn the secrets of organization in a small area . <p> Office ! We just moved into a new place where we actually have space to dedicate a whole room to be our office rather then a small corner and somehow it has become a jumping ground for all things we do n't  know what to do with a the moment . Help us reclaim our office ! <p> Where to start . I can pick an area in each room of my house that needs to be organized ! Papers to be filed are thrown into dresser drawers , the kitchen junk drawer is always a mess , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only one of my homes 3 closets is used for clothes- the rest are used for storage ! Help , I need this ! <p> My biggest organizational challenge is finding a place for everything . I was watching Oprah yesterday on hoarders , and I cant say I 'm anything near that , but I do have stuff that I do n't  necessarily have a place for and it seems to " pile up " in my playroom . <p> My bathroom is a big organizational challenge for me b/c there is a medicine cabinet , but no counter space or drawers . Everything just gets left on the sink not pretty . Thanks for the great giveaway ! <p> I work from home , and my husband has runs his own business out of our house . The mountains of paperwork are overwhelming ! Mail , catalogs , invoices , notes , project plans.it never ends !

I do n't  think I can pick just 1 challenge to organizing for me , but I instantly thought of 2 biggies for me . One I do n't  have a place for everythingI just do n't  know the best place for everything so my " stuff " does n't  have a " home . " Two I keep too much STUFF I like it .

Can I get them organized ? Just saying. ; - ) <p> my biggest challenge would be organizing and then accessing a lot of things in a small space .

My daugher is in her old room along with her daughter in her little toddler bed .

I planted bower vine and allow it to grow random and wild , only trimming it or tying it to the trellis when necessary to control it . <p> The trellis is constructed of wire and screw eyes and with the addition of bower vine has disguised the plainness of the wall , adding a welcome element of greenery . The leaves remain in winter and it blooms May through October with pink jasmine flowers . <p> I spied a similar wire trellis at my local Whole Foods , the technique used to achieve the same effect , this one constructed with diagonal wires instead of in a grid like mine . <p> Its a simple construction , this one also used screw eyes secured to the wall and galvanized wire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The wire trellis is an alternative to a structure you can purchase online or in a garden store , those are limited in shape and size and more expensive . The wires can be used to support any meandering vine as seen above or more formally by clipping and training vines into geometric patterns . <p> The art of espalier ( pronounced es-pal-yay ) is a favorite gardening technique for many people . It dates back many centuries , and was perfected by Europeans . Wineries and wine growers use a version of espalier to support grapevines , we also train our Pinot Noir vines each year , although less formally . <p> Whenever I see it in its most formal application I admire it very much because it takes patience and control , but the result is worth the wait , just like this tree I spied on a walk through Pacific Heights in San Francisco last year . <p> Espalier is the process of manipulating tree branches by forcing two dimensional growth along a constructed trellis on a single plane instead of allowing the branches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty to espalier but also a practicality , it is a clever way to add botanicals to tall walls or narrow outdoor spaces . The technique can also be used to create living fences or arbors as well . <p> source unknown <p> Fully trained , espalier trees are a focal point and work of art whether they 're ornamental or fruit bearing . It takes many years to train a tree and you can do it yourself with research , patience , and careful pruning or you can purchase an established espalier tree at a local nursery from specialist . <p> There are several defined types of espalier , the most recognizable is traditional horizontal Cordon . <h> 15 comments <p> Espalier dwarf apple trees are in the grand plan for our vegetable garden ( potager ) as a living fence . I am French and grew up admiring this type of planting , in particular in some of my parents friends gardens . <p> When I laid out our garden plans my husband said espa- what ? ! He thinks I am half crazy but goes along with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose vines . Apple trees may be next year ! It is taking forever to bring the vision to life , slowly but surely were getting there . <p> What a great post of trellis vine options ! I have a Virginia Wall Creeper that I purchased at the Asheville Farmers Market last fall . The purchase was in honor of riding the Virginia Creeper Trail with my 2 sisters in October . What a great trip it was your post gives many ideas and thankfully I have a wall on my house for the vine ! ! <p> We just renovated our yard ( were in Petaluma too ) and put in espaliered apple , pear , lemon and thornless blackberry along the fence line . It looks amazing and were getting our first apples this year on the tree !

I cant tell you how many landscape people we had out for help and they all looked at me like I was crazy . Why would I have a tree grow up against the house like that ? Why did the tree look like that ? They had never heard of an espalier tree ! How can you be in the business and not know about these ? lol Love the idea of the invisible trellis .. <p> I 've always loved this technique . Once lived in a house with susanqua espaliered along a brick garage wall . It was beautiful and the previous owners did it . But what do you do when a wall or fence needs painting ? <p> Love this technique SO much and have been trying ( for years ) to be allowed to espalier jasmine on my ugly brick fence wall ! I agree that ready-made trellises are limited/$$$ .. the iron ones I 've used have rusted , broken and pulled away from the wall .

Especially for all those out there who like white walls . I think white walls can be great , but they can also look a little boring if its not balanced out with an interesting collection of furnishings and decor . This would be a great way to add a little color , while still having white walls . Ive been thinking about this idea since your post on design trends ! It stuck out to me . Thanks for doing a post on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason I ask is because of the varying styles Ive seen based on the age of the home . In our area , we even have a few really old houses ( over 200 years ) that go as far as to paint the glazing putty on the window a different color from the wood components of the sash . On a colonial era house it can look very interesting . Usually we 'd see black putty with white or cream sash , but I think it would look good on a gray sash too . <p> We painted our front French doors in the very high gloss black and love the way they look . <p> Its always important to remember that paint is the first line of defense against the weather on old wooden divided light windows , so its extremely important to repaint somewhat often . However , that does n't  mean that they ca n't look really great at the same time ! <p> Love the pictures .

So dramatic yet still very cozy . <p> I love the look of painted french windows . We have a french bay style window in our living room which I 've contemplating painting a muted grey-green though I think it would mean painting all of the adjoining trim as well which I 'm hesitant about because its rather plain and not something I would normally make a feature of . I noticed that in many of the inspiration photos above the windows are independent though in a few they have adjoining trim which does seem to be painted to co-ordinate . I know its not essential though it does seem to make sense ( though I think its okay to paint a door in an entirely different colour ) .

Today I wanted to share the brief tale of how we moved our HVAC vent in the guest room with the help of the Dremel US40 Ultra Saw and offer one up for you to win today ! - We do n't advocate doing major changes to your home 's HVAC system without professional help , but in this situation we found moving the vent a few feet was n't too difficult and a project we could tackle on our own . <p> I did n't want the vent directly under the fan , I wanted it three feet closer to the closet wall and away from the fixture for aesthetic reasons so we moved it ourselves . <p> Our project required opening up the ceiling ( after we removed the popcorn ) to shorten the conduit . We also shut off the power to this room because we were working around the electrical wire to the ceiling fixture . <p> Once the ceiling was open Matt cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade attachment . <p> Sparks were flying so we made sure to have a fire extinguisher near just in case , he also wore protective eyewear . <p> We then reframed the section of the ceiling to support the metal duct , we recycled the old one and used FlexFix tape to seal the duct in its new location . <p> We reused the old sheetrock cuts to patch , tape , and retexture the ceiling with the vent in the new location . We then painted the walls and ceiling and installed the new fan . <p> Now the vent is no longer an eyesore and the ceiling fan gets the spotlight ! <p> The Dremel US40 Ultra Saw is a versatile tool with many home improvement applications . It comes with 4 cutting wheels/blades and can cut plywood , wood trim and baseboards , metal pipe , rebar and conduit . It also strips paint or thinset adhesive under tile , and can cut tile without water . Read all about what the tool can do here . <p> We 've recently moved and are gearing up for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come in handy for the garage shelving as well as some projects I have planned for the Mister in the front yard . <p> We are planning on putting a bathroom in an existing storage room . You never know what kind of problems you are going to run into , and this tool looks like it can help with just about all of them . Would make a potential headache or a remodel into a dream bathroom ! <p> We just bought a home that we now realize is much more of a fixer-upper than we had originally thought . This would be handy for replacing all of the trim , updating the bathrooms , and gutting the kitchen . <p> I would use the Dremel Ultra Saw in our kitchen a remodel covered up our floor vent and we have no air going into the kitchen because of it . Everything is in place , we just need to cut into the floor to access the vent ! <p> I love that fan its so sleek and modern . I have ceiling fans in all my bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sleek as this but its great for air flow , its about time they start making nicer looking ones . <p> I would use this saw for so many projects , we are re-doing our kitchen , an cutting out cabinets to add glass , then installing butcher block counters ourselves so cutting out the sink hole will be a lot more fun w this awesome saw ! ! Among all the other furniture building projects we tackle , thanks to Anna White plans ! <p> I 've wanted a Dremel for awhile , this would come in so handy ! ! We could use it on new baseboards and molding around the house , putting planks on the master bedroom ceiling to cover the popcorn ceiling , making shelves for our master closet , remodeling the kitchen and bathroom .. I could go on and on . Basically everything in our house needs to be redone ! <p> We just bought a new house so many projects . First on my list is to remove a half wall between the kitchen and family room . Drywall , trim work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it so much easier ! <p> I 'd think this tool would be a great addition to my very limited toolbox . I need to expand my DIY projects and getting additional tools is one of the things that 's holding me back ! I think that I would likely use this to update and add some trim in my home . I have a modern/traditional home which has some large entryways and doorways with no molding . I 'm determined to change this , so I could use the dremel tool to cut into the existing baseboard in order to add some door trim . <p> Oh gosh , there 's so many projects I could use it for : replacing a tile floor in our kitchen , finishing an office space in our basement , installing outdoor tile on top of our plain old concrete patio The list goes on and on ! Thank you ! <p> I would also use to move a few vents in my home . The one in my living room is placed in the middle of the wall so I have to keep my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy for the past 5 years ! ! ! Keeping my fingers crossed for the win b/c this would be a great tool to own . <p> Baseboards ! Well , actually crown molding and baseboards . I 'm wanting to update the basement ( finished in probably the 1970s or so . . . ) and it could definitely use some help in the class department . It would help make that task so much easier ! ! ! <p> I 'm not a building expert , but I am a desert dweller , here in AZ . I was told that builders often place the vent directly above the ceiling fan to help circulate the AC better . When placed on the side of the room and away from the fan , cold spots and hot spots tend to occur . Let me know if that does happen , because I agree that the vents are ugly but I 'm afraid to move them for fear of sweating all night long ! <p> I need to move the strike plate on a door just a smidge so it will cut tighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also need to cut down the door to our under eave storage in the bonus room , and think this would work . So I am sure that there are a number of ways I would use it , once I had it ! <p> yes please on the Dremel UltraSaw : ) I can see this would be so handy ( if not simply necessary ) on our upcoming kitchen DIY ( 1 ) removing granite 12+12 tiles used as a backsplash , ( 2 ) replacing the backer board after cutting the tiles out , and ( 3 ) installing a subway tile backsplash ( would use to cut the tile ) . We keep thinking this DIY is gon na be a large one but the Dremel UltraSaw sounds like it would cut it down to size see what I did there ? I sure would love to win this , Robin <p> this little guy would get a lot of use helping with one of our next projects : moving light fixtures to be centered ! I wish it were as easy as just replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a project of moving them as well . it will all be worth it in the end though ! <p> I would use a dremel saw for , well , everything in my almost-90-year-old home ! It seems like I 'm always needing to cut holes in walls/furniture/etc to run cords and so forth , and this would make it a lot easier . <p> This would be a tool I could feel confident using that way I can save those really big projects for my husband while I tackle all the smaller ones ! ; ) . My first project would be a tile backsplash in my kitchen . <p> How can I pick just one project ? We live in a 1954 house that needs all sorts of renovationwed start in the bathroom &amp; this wonderful tool would certainly help . Tanks fr the chance o win onewere on an extremely limited budget . <p> I would use this in just about every aspect of my hourse . I have a complete remodel currently under way in my house . Every single thing in our house needs done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add insulation ( there wasn ; t any ) and to update all the wiring ) , so sheet rock , routing new HVAC ( adding in A/C ) and adding tile floors . This tool would be a life saver for me ! <p> We are re-doing our closets to make custom shelving . Were doing it DIY and learning as we go . This saw would definitely help make the work a cinch . We live in a small NY apartment as well so the size and usefulness really add to its allure ! Love your blog . Thank you for keeping it up ! <p> I 've got a section of tile in my bathroom that I need to redo and this would be perfect for it . And for building some pipe and wood shelves . . . . for installing tile on my fireplace . . . . the list goes on ! <p> That Dremel Ultra Saw looks amazing ! I live in a rental , but in our tiny hallway they left the old baseboards instead of installing new ones so I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could use that dremel to work on our 3 vehicles as well so it would do double duty ! <p> Our finished attic had a dresser that was built in against the chimney in the 50s . I removed the warped dresser but now need to put in some supports and a new section of wall . The dremel would be great ! <p> I would use one of these all the time ! We are renovating our home and constantly need to trim up pieces of molding , or cut some wood for a furniture projectwould be way handier than bringing out the circular or miter saw each time ! <p> Would be nice to use one to plunge cut openings for outlets in our upcoming dining room wainscoting project , as well as our bathroom &amp; kitchen remodels . Nice job on the ceiling btw , looks professional . <p> I would use it to cut out a shelf in a thrifted cabinet that I 'm planning on using as a sideboard . The shelves are n't  moveable and one of them needs to be moved to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had a Dremel for years and this last weekend my son used it to cut a rusted pipe off the bottom of an old hand operated water pump that he put in my flower garden . If I had the saw I would use it in the same way . We also used our Dremel to cut the bolts holding a radiator on the side of an old lawnmower . They are just invaluable tools ! <p> I have different baseboards throughout my home . Three different styles in my living room alone ! This tool would help me achieve my goal of getting it all replaced with one style by the end of the year . <p> I 've got a number of projects lined up that would be a perfect candidate for this tool . First is to install the moulding around a closet door that has been on hold because we do n't  have the right tool to cut away the existing baseboard trim . Then its on to the main hall closet renovation ! <p> Oooh boy , I would use the Dremel saw as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a wall , changed the configuration and now we are putting it back together . We have learned so , so much ! It is going to be a big , beautiful , functional kitchen for our family ! ! <p> Wow ! Ive been lusting after the Dremel saw for some time now . It would be perfect for a handful of projects on the " to do " list : crown moulding , tile backsplash , and replacing some floor trim . Thanks for the chance ! <p> Just one ? ! I have narrow , developer-installed baseboards throughout my house so this would be very handy to take them out and install nicer replacements . That 's to sell this place . Then when we move into our new ( to us ) 1941 adobe , well be tiling the bathroom and kitchen . <p> Where do I start ? I have some horribly outdated oak cabinets , with strange raised moldings in the center of the panels . I 'd use the Dremel Ultra Saw to cut out the panels in the doors and replace them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , many projects I 'd do with this saw . <p> I would love to use this saw for cutting wood for DIY projects ! I live in an apartment , so there is very little room for large projects or tools . I usually recruit my dad to do my small woodworking projects ! <p> My first project would be to open the soffits in the kitchen and use the space for extra storage . I 'm a little scared of power tools , but this one looks workable for me . Thank you for the great giveaway ! <p> Oh , I could so use the Dremmel Saw around my house . I have lots of projects and lots of half finished projects I could use it on . Finishing up the garageinstalling work benches and peg boards . Finishing up a half finished basementbuilding shelves , walls , etc And lots of craft projects that I do ! Thank you for the chance to win ! <p> One project ? We have a bathroom remodel so definitely tile work among other things . We need new flooring upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there 's another . Ill stop nowdont get me started . But what a super cool tool . Thanks for sharing ! <p> We are remodeling our entire home , starting with the living room . This would help with the wood flooring we will put down , changing the outlets that are totally in the wrong place and everything else we know we will run into . <p> I would love love love to have this saw for my passion in redoing furniture and upgrading rooms in our home . Working on the kitchen next so it would come in very handy for the nook bench Im building , backsplash , etc etc. ! ! <p> Oh , wow ! What an awesome tool , which I can think of so many way to use ! ! Our next project is removing &amp; replacing the bathtub in our full bath , also laying porcelain floor tile and new tub wall , vanity/sink and medicine cabinet . So , this Dremel would be an invaluable help with all of that ! ! I have actually been researching tile saws for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw could cut tile ? ! ! ! So cool ! Your fan/ceiling looks great and love the whole remodel , thanks for sharing ! ! I have been working on putting a little blog together , I thought it would be fun to share our progresss on this project we are getting ready to tackle . <p> Great project . I would use this tool to replace all the floor registers in my 1960s home . I have beautiful hardwood floors and baseboards and super ugly metal registers . However , the new wood registers are about an inch too large and currently this project is on hold because it took me several hours to sand down just one opening <p> There are a ton of little jobs , but since I am currently working on a dining room/kitchen update I would use it for cutting trim and baseboards as well as any other misc cutting job that comes along ! <p> Posting the terrific improvement of your ceiling eyesore , reminds me of two bedrooms in my home . What were they thinking when they slapped this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which now has only 2 blades ( Do n't  ask ! ) twirls across a pot light , giving a disconcerting strobe effect , AND the vent is in the wrong place . In the other room , we need to move the vent away from the center , as you did . Come to think if it , every room in this house has a ceiling eyesore . And having just seen how great my neighbors new crown moulding looks , I 'm hoping to add that to several roomsI could go on and on . This would be just the motivator we need ! So thank you ( and good luck to me ! ) PSyour reno is looking amazing . Its fun to see the transformation ! <p> We just installed a closet system in the guest bedroom of our old house , and we sure could have used a Dremel saw we ended up making some tricky cuts with a hand saw ( argh ! ) . Our next project is creating a utility cabinet in a hall closet ( no prefab system ) the Dremel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dying to replace the dated backsplash ( think snowflake pattern in my beachy home ! ! ) in our kitchen for years , but my husband was n't budging on it.until we finally just had our oak cabinets painted white and our walls redone , and he agreed that white subway tile would be a welcome improvement ! The only caveat ? I have to do the tilework myself : ) So .. great tools would make the job much more manageable ; ) <p> I would use it to relocate the ugly ceiling access pull-down stair contraption in our hallway as seen from our entry foyer ! Any ideas you have to camouflage this sucker would be appreciated too ! I so badly need this Dremel saw ! ! ! Just saying ? ! ! ! <p> Oh , I would use this in so many places in my home ! We recently bought our first house , which is a fixer-upper ( and that 's unfortunate because the previous owner apparently did tons of renovations before it sold , but they were done so badly that they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets in weird places , uneven door trim , and so much more ) <p> I find so many things to create . I would use the Dremel to replace the tile in my master bath . After that I would use it in all my furniture projects . I love to build things and this would be a great edition to my tool collection . <p> Where should I start . Hoping to remove old tile through my whole house , redoing some interior doors , then moving on to my daughters house to help with all the projects on their older home . Great giveaway ! <p> Youngest of five kids leaving for college tomorrow and this stay-at-home mother is trading in her chauffeur cap for a construction hat . Fifteen years of " real living " has taken a toll . Bring on the Dremel Ultra Saw : leaking upstairs bath ( and corresponding kitchen ceiling repair ) ; cracked tile floors ; garage door frame battered by a steady succession of 16 year old drivers ; and , finally , a master bath renovation just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projects . <p> This dremel looks great . I would be using it to cut tiles for my backsplash in the kitchen . I plan to start building birdhouses to decorate in a Victorian stylethis is my Plan B ! ! ! Also want to build a dollhouse to my specs and this would give me the ability to do it without help ! ! <p> Great giveaway ! I must enter without my husband knowing because if I win he has a big job to do ! Re tile my ensuite . The Dremel Ultra Saw would be a great help to remove the existing tiles . I 'm feeling lucky ! Thanks Kate ! <p> 6 months in our new home and still have plenty of projects for this bad boy ! Biggest project would probably be installing kitchen tile back splash which i never would have thought I could do without renting a large tile saw and making a huge mess . This would be great . <p> I am planning the last update to my home ( after 27 years ) and would love to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my spare bathroomthis would tool would certainly make it easier to get the tiles out around the shower and only one on the floor that is cracked <p> So many uses come to mind ! First , would use tool to cut sink opening in granite countertop in bathrooms replacing hideous vessel sinks with a more traditional drop in ceramic sinks . Then would use the tool to cut through marble tile floor since we are making an unnecessarily huge master bath smaller and want to save the existing floor ! Then on to kitchen backsplash tiles and the list just keeps going ! <p> We are renovating a lake house right now and I could use this tool on all sorts of projects . This week I 'm cutting plywood to make shelves for our kitchen pantry and a Dremel saw would definitely come in handy ! <p> Which project to use the Dremel on first ? ! I have a tile problem in my newly built master bath ( grout is cracking and tile is lifting up ) , a bookcase that I want to turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , build closet organizers for 3 bedrooms , and build a big girl bed for my 5 yr old . Fingers and toes crossed my comment is picked . : ) <p> This post gives me the inspiration I need to finally dremel out the gunky paint the previous owners used the " fix " the grout on the bathroom floor . I would then be able to re-grout . I have been a little chicken of the dremel , but am way less intimidated after seeing what you guys did ! I would also use one to cut down a the disused pipe from our old water heater so I can re-finish the closet ! <p> I would love to have this small saw ! I am getting ready to do some board and batten trim in my living room and hallway as well as beefing up my wood trim around doors and windows . This looks like the perfect tool and just the right size and weight for my hands ! Thanks for the opportunity of this giveaway . <p> I have a phobia about saws and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm perfectly capable of doing . This little saw appeals to me the way its constructed and the size make me think I could wrap my head around using it . <p> If I 'm not the winner ( and I 'm really not likely to be ) I think I 'll trot off to my local store and have a look at this little thing . It may be my next purchase . <p> Uhhello tile ? ! ? ! ! ! I had no idea , and that 's exactly what this baby would be used for ! I 'm trying to save my kitchen &amp; bathroom tile projects for when Im ready to do both at once to rent a saw just once . Psh ! Not if I can snag this ! <p> Were packing for a cross-country move to a temporary rental while we look around for what will be our " forever " home . My husbands an avid DIY-er and rehabber , but we no longer have a working Dremel . I know it would be used heavilybut wont know where/how until we settle on our next house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool arsenal ( and much more portable than the heavy table saws we regretfully decided to leave behind and replace when needed again ) . <p> For EVERYTHING in our house . We began building our home 7 years ago and once we had it done enough for the inspection to switch from a construction loan to our regular mortgage nothing has been REALLY finished . You kick a baseboard a little too hard and you will quickly noticed its just laying there against the wall , not fastened , ha ! A Dremel will be used nonstop , it looks like a wonderful tool for all of our DIY projects . <p> Number one on my list is installing a cat flap into the basement door so Kitty can do her business ! We wont have to leave the basement door cracked open all the time , and it would be a great energy saver ! <p> Your relocation is a huge upgrade . A Stengel would be so useful at our house . We need to remove a small section if tile . This would be the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through in the kitchen and there is no better tool for that job either . I am keeping my fingers crossed ! <p> Oh my ! My husband and I just bought our very first house and there are so many projects we would use this for ! ! ! Adding baseboards to our little house would probably be the first move . Even though the house is over 60 years old , no one ever put in baseboards ! ! Thanks for a chance to win ! <p> I have two sets of twins and a jack and jill bathroom that the towel bar is placed so low my kids are accidentally going to ripe it off the wall . I would use the Dremel to some sort of of wall treatment ( beadboard , board and batton , etc ) . <p> I have so many projects planned that this saw would be perfect for . One of the first projects is building a sofa table because I cant find one with the dimensions and style that I want . I have been thinking about tiling the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut tile Second , I want to add trim to our very plain ( and ugly ) interior doors before painting them white . Third , I want to add crown molding to a couple of rooms in our house . We bought this house a little over three years ago and have a long list of updating projects . We have finished a few but have a lot more to go . <p> I could use this in just about every room in our outdated ranch . We are in the midst of a kitchen reno , and every other room will need help too ! Especially our yellow hallway bath and powder blue master bath ! <p> Oh gracious , we 'd use this all over the place ! Were in the ( slow , painful ) process of re-doing nearly every room in our house , one at a time . First up is a former carport , now enclosed as an additional room . It was an apartment for my brother and his wife for a little while , but now that they 've moved to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teacher husband , and a craft room for me and my daughter . There was a ceiling leak , however , that requires patching drywall very much as you 've done here . <p> I 'd use the Dremel for everything around the house , both inside and out . The first thing I 'd do is use it to cut up the disgusting subfloor in our kitchen that has been plagued with years worth of " gifts " from the previous owners cats . <p> I would use it to remove the hideous box fluorescent drop light fixture THING in our kitchen . I wish I could put a photo in the comments so you could see how ugly this 1990s light fixture ( its a drywalled , wood-trimmed , box that hangs down in the center of my galley kitchen . I have a " fat " galley , with one side being curved , and they made the light fixture curve on one side to follow the countertop , even though the upper cabinets above are square . Its just strange and huge ( contains 4 long and 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my kitchen making it feel so much smaller . I cant wait to demo it ! <p> We could use this in a million places ! More specifically , we are getting ready to put some built-ins in our guest bedroom , and this would be so much easier to bring upstairs than our ancient table saw : ) <p> How awesome is the new Dremel tool ? ? I can think of a million things I could use this for , but the first one would be to use it for some new ceiling light repositioning in our living room . Ugh ceiling drywall repair is the worst ! <p> A Dremel is totally one if those tools you always wish you had mid-project , amiright ? ! ? Haha right now it would be pretty handy for installing our new herringbone slate backsplash ! LOTS of weird cuts going on ! <p> This tool can do it all ! ! ! I like that its so versatile , and not crazy intimidating to me . I think I would be much more confident about taking on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would LOVE to do that but renting a big tile saw scares me ! ) <p> Were planning on DIYing as much as possible in our kitchen remodel this winter the Dremel would be so handy for removing thinset when we demolish the tile floor , cutting wood for trim , and so much more ! <p> I 'd like to add our microwave above our stove ( yay for getting that counter space back ! ) and then adding some great tiling in our kitchen rather than the odd minimal one layer of boring white tiles we currently have . <p> So many things ! We have to cut a section out of our baseboard to get bookshelves to sit flush against the wall for a " built-in " look . Also need to add a HVAC vent to our newly-finished laundry room , so this tool would be great for making the hole in the ceiling . Oh , and we need to cut the metal screws down on the base of our toilet so we can get the decorative caps to finally fit the list could go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a friend with this tool and he helped me cut the base of all of the door trim off at just the right level to install flooring under them for a seamless look . I would LOVE my own Dremel to continue the improvements ! <p> What a fabulous Dremel tool ! ! ( And what fun it is to witness the transformation of your Vegas home ) I 'm the construction person in our household ; my husband and I have a perfect division of labor along lines of talent and interest . I completely replaced the mouldings in our 1980s house several years ago ( can you say " ugly yellow oak " ? ? ) and now long to completely redo the master bath from the studs . Curiously angled walls ( all four corners ) and the ubiquitous light soffit above the vanity would be the first to fall under the Dremel blade . <p> I bought my first and presently only saw whan I learned how to install crown molding . I have only just begun on making our home our own and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like good art supplies and well worth the cost . Only issue is the cost can get up there so slowly building our resources is the only option . Next on the list is a small bath renovation , and filling in the space above my kitchen cabinets ! Thanks for the giveaway ! ! Your blog is both smart and rich with information . Thank you for that too . : ) <p> Both of my bathrooms need remodeling . I want to build the new sink cabinets myself and also pull up the old floor tile and lay new tile . I am adding to my tool chest little by little and would like the opportunity to learn how to use the Dremel . Please and thank you ! <p> My house is 55 years old with the original kitchen ( ugh ) so plenty of work for the Dremel Saw . I would probably use it first in my tin work to cut tin and copper . I like to create light scones and crosses using Mexican tin work techniques . Thanks . <p> I need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors in both my bathrooms . But first , I am renovating a screened porch and the first thing I would is use it to help me in removing framing elements that need to be replaced . And I can think of so many other potential applicationsI hope having more than one does n't  disqualify me ! <p> I LOVE this tool . For starters , I would use it to remove some cracked tiles on my living room floor that were improperly installed spanning a concrete joint ( instead of 2 pieces with caulk over the crack or that crack joint spanning fabric underneath ) . Since I have radiant floor heat , its especially important to be careful about the concrete underneath and the dremel saw would help me do exactly that . Thanks for this opportunity to enter to win ! <p> I would use this to cut out and replace some tile that has come loose in our master bath ! The tile itself is n't broken , its just come unstuck from the thinset and the grout is cracked . If I could get all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just replace the one tile and save our bathroom floor from a big demo job ! <p> I have four projects that I could finally start and finish . I ripped the carpet off my stairs and need to install the shoe molding , bathroom tile needs to be re-grouted , and this would be awesome for some other tiling jobs that need to be done . <p> We have a bunch of closets with useless shelves that keep falling down because of terrible installation by the last owners . I have been bugging my husband to work on them , but he has so many projects started already ! I wanted him to tackle them because I am so intimidated by the big heavy table saw , but I feel like I could handle a Dremel ! I need to cut both the metal supports to the proper size and trim the shelves themselves . <p> Where would we not use a dremel ? The most immediate is a bathroom remodel . We need to move some of the pluming and need to cut out the wall to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my own cause his is not always available and he gets kind of touchy about me using his tools : - ) <p> We are in the midst of remodeling the downstairs of our old ( 100+ year-old ) home . It was last remodeled in the early 70s . We could use this in SO many intended projects ! Wow what a great give-away ! : ) <p> We have a small old Dremel tool that we use all the time . We are at the end of a major remodel , but still have many little projects to finish . I am sure this tool would come in handy . We still need to do stairs , trim , doors and the kids bathroom . <p> This would be awesome for ANY of the millions of projects we have including : changing all the baseboards in our house , installing new trims around the door frames , building a coffee table , and so on .. Good luck to all ! : ) <p> We have a small dremel that we use for all kinds of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to a whole new level . I would begin by using it to repurposed furniture . The possibilities are nearly endless ! <p> We moved into our home about a year ago and I have MANY projects that the Dremel Ultra saw would come in handy for ! Wainscoting in the dining room , built-ins around the fireplace , building a custom organizing station for backpacks , shoes , etc. and , we will be finishing our basement this winter I could go on forever because I love DIY projects and I would LOVE a Dremel to help me with them ! Love your blog , too , keep it coming ! : ) <p> Ive been wanting to redo my kitchen back splash ( right now , its just wall and nothing else ) , but Ive put it off because honestly , I want to do tile , but do n't  want to have to rent stuff just to cut a few pieces of tile . This would be perfect ! <p> Oh ! All the projects I could use the Dremel Ultra Saw forcutting the nosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tile in the bathroom that is coming out soon , the kitchen vent hood we are putting in to replace the above cabinet microwaveI could go on and on . <p> First project that comes to mind is building a headboard for our daughters bedroom which she recently requested . I 'm sure we could use this nice little Dremel saw for all kinds of needed DIY home projects ! <p> I have been a huge Dremel fan for years . I have one of their multi-purpose tools that I have used for everything from cutting pinecones in half to sculpting a big Uncle Sam out of a block of wood . This saw would mean I could do projects myself and not have to ask my husband to drag out his table saw or circular saw . Hooray for Dremel.another awesome tool for DIY women like me ! I need to cut a number of pieces of wood for a garden club project and this would make it so much easier for me . <p> Oh , man we just rehabbed 2 bathrooms , a bedroom , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the living room , another bathroom , and the master bedroom . Sure could have used it 6 months ago but NOW would be good too ! <p> This is one tool Ive been thinking about gettingI can see it for so many projects , especially the ceiling tin projects I 'm about to begin ( why I 've been looking into this tool ) ! I 'm crossing my fingers Catherine <p> So many ! Right now , kitchen back splash is calling my name ( since we had to re-do the kitchen due to a faulty pipe .. ) , then one tile around the fireplace cracked after we moved in ( a friend helping us move broke it ) , so we need to replace it and maybe even do a facelift ( chim-lift ? ) , then we have carpet in the basement that needs to be removed due to water leaks ( previous owner did n't  maintain it ) and I would love to have tile there . Like I said so many ! <p> I have so many projects and this would be a great tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sons room ( he just started college ) and have trim and flooring to do . Gosh I hope I win that tool ! <p> We recently purchased a home so we have plenty of projects going on at once ! But , this saw would be especially helpful in our restoration of an old outbuilding that came with our property . We are hoping to turn it into my workshop ! Thanks for the opportunity ! <p> I 'm an artist that works in 3-d paintings . I keep my Dremel working all the time and would love to add the saw to my repitoire . The first thing that I would tackle would probably be some styrofoam heads or babydolls . <p> Where would n't I use the Dremel Ultra Saw ? Were remodeling most of our house ourselves , including moving air ducts like you did in our basement . It had n't  occurred to me to use a Dremel until I read your post . Thanks ! <p> I want this DREMEL ! ! ! ! I do all the DIYs around the house . The Dremel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new store bought frame ( marked down , but wrong size ) to fit an existing canvas painting . This Dremel will help complete this project in a snap ! <p> this would work for the tiles that need to be reset in all the bathrooms and the kitchen ! honestly , this would be perfect for the so many little projects that have popped up since they found a sinkhole under our house ! <p> I think the fence in the back yard would benefit from a tool like this . The molding around the kitchen door could also be improved with just a bit of work if this tool were in my possession . Thanks for all the great posts ! <p> I would love to have this handy little tool ! I am getting ready to re-do our master bedroom and want to install wood planks on one wall , but there are so many other projects I would use this on . Thanks for making this give-away available ! <p> I 'd use it to cut through the metal webbing around our plastered kitchen ceiling that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting the stuff before with wire cutters and ended up needing stitches . Its very sharp ! <p> Where would I start ? ! Tile install in the upstairs bathrooms and kitchen backsplash , making frames , cutting my diy curtain rods from conduit . Kate , thanks for hosting the giveaway . I love what you 're doing with both of your homes ! <p> Oh goodness.The projects on my list are endless that I could use this fabulous saw for . " Dremel means quality " as my hubby says , and I would first use it to cut the drywall in my master bedroom to make space for a built-in shelving unit . I would also use it to remove the yucky tile in our laundry room and replace it with something more modern and sleek . Thank you for the wonderful giveaway .

Thanks . <p> Too many projects to name individually , but suffice it to say that until we sell the home that we just moved out of we now OWN TWO HOMES . My immediate solo plan in our former home includes removing carpet from a small room and replacing it with tile . The Dremel Ultra Saw looks like the perfect tool for this and soooooo many future projects ! ! ! <p> To start , I would use the Dremel saw to cut the marble tile I want to install as a backsplash in my kitchen .

This Dremel would make bigger tools unnecessary , and I 'd love to add a 2nd power tool , to my one electric drill collection : ) <p> I recently started writing a DIY blog for the newspaper where I am a staff writer . I 'm sure I can find some use for this saw . As for a specific project , I 'm thinking of the childs desk with metal legs I just garbage picked off the street yesterday .

Thanks for offering this giveaway , Kate . <p> I will be making custom square lattice to attach under our deck so I do n't  have to use the pre-fab diagonal lattice from the big box stores . The Dremel Ultra-Saw would make this project so much easier ! <p> Oh , I could totally use the Dremmel saw to remove a 12 ? x 12 ? square of mosaic travertine tile in my master bathroom that does not match the surround tileits must more yellow-toned than the surrounding tile , and drives me nuts every time I notice it . The Dremmel would allow me to expertly and precisely remove the offending tiles , and then I could replace it with matching tile ! <p> If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would cut a couple of inches of the legs of my console table which is way too high , I would do the same on the master bedroom door which does n't  open all the away after the wall to wall carpet was installed , I would make shelves into a closet in the boys room to organize all his toys and so much more ! ! <p> We have a 150 year old house and are just starting to tackle some projects to restore it ( beginners here ! ) .

I have no tools yet and am still researching how I get started . If I were to have the Dremel saw , I would give it a well-loved home ! <p> The Dremel US40 Ultra Saw is compatible and preferable for many ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one project which makes the Ultra Saw the perfect tool : we are re-doing the second floor porch on the front of our home . We have ripped up the existing wood . My husband has ordered ship-lapped aluminum planking to lay ( float ) on top of the existing rubber membrane . The cuts must be precise . The Dremel US40 Ultra Saw is the tool of choice for cutting the planks ! <p> Awesome ! We have a heating vent to reroute in our bathroom . I would start there . Then there 's some trim work on the inside . The entry steps on the outside need some Dremel love . And the list goes on and on ! <p> Honestly , I 'd pack this in a checked suitcase and take it to our apartment in India ! ! Because some workers there use really rudimentary tools .

LOL . <p> We have been putting off tiling our backsplash and would love to do it ourselves with the use of this Dremel saw ! Crown Molding is another project on our list.This saw would be an awesome catch ! Thanks ! <p> Where do I begin with the projects we could use a dremel saw ? I think the first one would be to add overhead lighting in all of our bedrooms the house we bought has no lights in any of the bedrooms and that is the first item on the honey-do list . 23102 @qwx883102

It was a kind gesture with a *ahem* questionable result . This is what the dresser looked like before I got my hands on it . <p> Clearly someone got a little carried away with the Under the Sea ' theme and then threw in some black and white action just to keep us all mesmerized . It 's not that I have a thing against tropical fish . They 're cute on canvas or in a fish tank or floating in front of my snorkel mask while I 'm vacationing in Hawaii . I 'm just not a fan of them on a pine dresser .

Usually , AS chalk paint does not require priming but I absolutely could not risk those fish seeping through using the primer bought me that peace of mind . <p> Next I painted the dresser in AS chalk paint in Old White , then once it was dry , measured and marked my stripes with painter 's tape .

In that case , peel the tape when the second coat is still wet . <p> Once the stripes were dry , I distressed them a little to give the dresser a slightly weathered look , then waxed it with clear wax . <p> The stripes run all the way from the top straight down to the bottom and give the piece a cool coastal vibe .

And seriously , why did someone not tell me that painters tape trick before now ? ! So much time , energy , and money wasted ! I 'm feeling the urge to paint some stripes now ! <p> It looks fab now . Love the tip about painting the tape with the top coat first . Will def have to try that if I ever get away from the eight month old clinging to my leg and manage to make-over another piece of furniture in my life : - ) <p> I really really love this .

I think I would have either , repositioned the top drawer knobs and lined the stripe up so they were centered , or treated the top drawers differently and lined the stripes to make the remaining knobs centered its a gigantic improvement over the old , though ( and I use Caromal Colours Reclaim paint I like it much better than AS ) <p> I just returned from New Orleans and two days with Annie Sloan herself .. you are going to LOVE her presentation on colors that she will give in San Fransisco .

I wish I 'd read your tutorial on stripes 10 years ago . I learned the hard way that dry to the touch is not cured . I painted stripes on my daughters bedroom walls only to have the base color come off with the tape ! I 've never tried painting a little of the base coat over the tape , but I will in the future .

I found Chalk Paint at The Melon Patch in Ontario and have ordered it online . I cant wait to try it . I have a beautiful Armoire in a Robin Egg Blue but I 'm going to paint over it with Arles .

@@99057627 @3257627/ <h> Tile Flooring : Demo + Installation <p> By Kate Riley August 6 , 2014 <p> Today I 'm back with another progress report on the Nevada house renovation , this one focused on the flooring ! Two weeks ago I shared we chose to remove the old carpet and tile and replace it all downstairs with Daltiles Forest Park in Sugar Maple ( see the " before " here ) . <p> As I mentioned in that post , if the downstairs floors had been all plain white porcelain tile we might have kept that tile but because it was mixed with three kinds of dingy carpet we decided it all had to go to achieve a seamless more contemporary look from room to room . <p> Matt and I considered demolishing and installing the flooring ourselves for about 45 seconds , then came to the sane conclusion that professional demo and installation was a much smarter idea . 1,100 square feet of demo and tile installation would surely send us to both marital and physical therapy . <p> Also , these floors have to be perfect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the house with the living room on the right and the family room/breakfast nook on the left . Connecting the tile through the kitchen and around walls without anything wonky happening was essential and that made us nervous to tackle the install ourselves . <p> Someday I 'll write a post about when we DIY and when we hire out but this flooring project is the perfect example . We gathered three bids and chose the one we felt could do the work in the most timely and professional way and for a reasonable cost . Demolition began with the carpeted spaces and baseboard removal . <p> Tile removal is a lot harder , first just getting the tiles off the floor takes strong tools and muscles <p> The first tool the crew used was a heavy pry bar and the tiles popped off pretty fast but broken pieces went flying everywhere ( protective eyewear necessary ! ) . We really appreciated that before starting demo they papered the freshly smooth textured walls ( that burgundy paper shown ) , it was conscientious of the hard work from last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crow bar to pop them off one by one . <p> My Dad wanted a piece of the action with that pry bar so he took out the tile under the fireplace in an oh so appropriate shoe choice for tile removal . : ) <p> For thinset mortar removal , the crew used two tools , the first was a scraper , they used a sander to sharpen the edges a few times throughout the day . <p> This smaller scraper works well for removing old thinset mortar and scraping down to the slab concrete foundation . I volunteered to do a 4 ' x 12 ' section myself to get a feel for it for future projects . Therapeutic and a great arm workout but I was sweating buckets ! <p> For more stubborn thinset they used a small jackhammer and it came off easily . <p> Once the tile and thinset were gone we came back in with a Shop Vac to clean every bit of dust off the floor to prep for the tile that was coming the next day . <p> After much discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most visible line of sight in the living room on the left wall . Its the first place your eye naturally goes when you enter the home and where the walkway will be so it made sense to start on that wall instead of the opposite . <p> The crew is using chalk lines to measure the distance between walls and to ensure the tiles run straight and a level to make sure the floor remains smooth across the long surfaces ( not shown , forgot to take pics ! ) They are weaving their way from the living room/entry through the kitchen and hallway and into the family room . <p> The 9 x 36 " tiles are being installed in a random pattern much like real hardwood planks . The product recommendation calls for 1/8 " spacers , though I personally wanted to use 1/16 " for slightly thinner grout lines . But since both the installer and the manufacturer recommended 1/8 " we went with that . We chose a grout that 's a match to the colorbody so those lines will be far less visible when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it looks in the house , were getting everything we want , a wood look product in a cool contemporary porcelain tile with a seamless flow room to room throughout the downstairs . <p> Ill share the final pictures of the flooring next week once the tile is grouted and cleaned and once we install the new white baseboards , so far we absolutely LOVE it ! <p> *Disclosure : all Forest Park Sugar Maple tile for this project provided by DaltileG . ( We paid for the demolition and installation . ) All opinions are my own ! <p> Looks very nice . The only thing that concerns me is the lack of insulation below the wood flooring . Have you considered some sort of insulation or what 's s the reasoning behind not putting any ? Greetings <p> For grout and glue removal , we 've used the same equipment that you mentioned . For our second demo , we discovered a machine at a rental place that is a 15 ? scraper on a machine that hammers at the glue/grout just like a jack hammer does but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workout and I feel like I 'm vibrating for a couple of hours after using it . <p> Love the wood grained tile .

But after seeing 5 strong young men work on it for a solid day , I realized I 'd be doing demo until next April Fools Day . Never mind hauling away all the debris in The Mighty Honda one bucket at a time . <p> We have a 2nd home in the Phoenix area . It currently has wall-to-wall carpet in realtor beige which is always filthy . The house is kept at 80 degrees when were not there and 70ish while were there .

Is it common in your area of the country for whole levels of a house to be tiled ? I 've seen that pop up on a few blogs lately , but that 's not something I 've ever heard of before . <p> with a first floor slab foundation no hardibacker needed Suzie but we will use it on the second floor for the bathrooms in this home back home in California we use hardibacker under tile for raised foundations on the first and second floor <p> I love this look and want to use it in my master bathroom would that look weird ?

I just installed 12 ? x 24 ? porcelain in my 3ft x 6ft tiny half bath and I LOVE IT ! ! ! I love how sturdy it feels under foot ( we had to use hardibacker under , on our wood subfloor ) and how easy it is to clean , and the larger tiles somehow make the room look larger ! ! ? ? ! . we also used matching grout color , and it looks just beautiful !

Floating shelves are lovely of course , they have appeal due to their clean lines . There is something equally as appealing as shelving with beautiful brass brackets , adding both support and a bit of bling . They look especially wonderful with wood shelves and extra elegant with marble shelves . <p> But who says you need to spend the big bucks on brass . If you do n't want to drop cash on the real deal , spray paint is your best friend ! Get the look for less by using gold leaf or brass colored spray paint to a basic bracket ( these ones have a great shape ) like these bloggers did below . <h> 10 comments <p> Those shelf brackets are amazing ! Especially the deco-ish ones that sort of fan out- so much style for such a small item ! <p> If you have time , check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online auctions .

I consider myself pretty thrifty , but when you are forced to stick to a $5 dollar budget in this contest , you must get very resourceful . <p> Disclosure : I was completely unsure when I started this project if it would be a disastrous waste of time , so I decided to invest nothing beyond what I had on hand , which meant using brown not white eggs . Or you can just use store bought plastic eggs , but I 'm cheap . Unsure of the outcome , I refused to brush my hair , my teeth , or get dressed out of my flannel plaid pajamas to make a special trip to the craft store or grocery store . In hindsight , white eggshells would work better to save time and several layers of tissue . Just saying . <p> Gingerly paint your eggshell with the glazy watered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying your layers of tissue paper . Glaze and glue , glue and glaze . Layer , layer , layer . <p> I 'm gon na guesstimate it 's about 15 to 18 strips of tissue per egg and it takes about five minutes to cover each one . Maybe more . With a kindergartener , I can guarantee a solid fifteen minutes per egg . And very gooey stubby fingers . And frustration and drama at the end of egg #1 which requires Mom to take over and finish the project that was supposed to be a bonding experience but has become a tedious craft . <p> Your eggs will get all wrinkly in some parts . The texture can not be avoided due to curvaceous nature of an egg when you wrap tissue around it , but you can minimize with more moisture and thinner strips . <p> For more vivid color , you could kill two birds ' and add some craft paint to your glue " they do blend rather nicely . This also will give you colored eggs if you only have white tissue paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours and arrange in a charming little nest . <p> Total cost : half dozen eggs $1.50 ; tissue paper $1.50 <p> = $3.00 total . <p> If you 've got a great Dollar Store craft , link up to Lindsay 's Dollar Store Challenge , scheduled for Thursday March 25th , finalists to be selected by three great bloggers . <p> The final burning question is what do you do with all of your egg whites and yolks ? Why you make a gourmet scramble of course . Mix in some cheese , tomatoes , and fresh herbs and float away to brunch heaven . <p> In conclusion , any craft that has an edible ending certainly has my vote . : - ) <h> 46 comments <p> " And frustration and drama at the end of egg #1 which requires Mom to take over and finish the project that was supposed to be a bonding experience but has become a tedious craft .

While technically not hung above , but off to the side , curtains are the finishing touch to a bed that sits under a window , just be sure to have light blocking shades behind them for catching extra ZZZs . <p> 10. - Nothing. - Who says something above your bed is a must ? - Not true , especially with a statement like a four poster or bold upholstered headboard. - - Art , mirrors , windows , or lamps on each side are often enough. - The emptiness above the bed gives the eye a place to rest and adds to the serenity. <h> 78 comments <p> I love these ideas , but being a Southern California native , I thought I should say that those who live in earthquake country should be careful about what kinds of objects they place over their beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night you do n't  want those things falling on your head while you 're sleeping ! ) . I do n't  know if those who live in earthquake country but did n't  grow up there are aware . Thanks : ) <p> You read my mind ! Just about every day ( or several times a day ) I wonder what to do with the odd space about my bed . A floral metal tray has been there for a few years but were not crazy about it . And it really does not look right with the new bedding . I always have my eye out for the right piece of artwork but it has to be horizontal , as the headboard is high and the ceilings are average . Looking at all your ideas , I realize that for my space , my favorite look is #10 , absolutely NOTHING ! <p> So off I go to take down the tray and hardware . timing is right since today my husband is removing some shelves and spackling the walls in our master bedroom . Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago and he s been non-stop with the home improvement ! Even repainted and cleaned our outside light fixtures thanks for the dual-inspiration Kate ! ) <p> Whatever you hang , make sure it is hung securely ! I no longer hang objects that have glass , sharp points or are heavy above beds , I love a good nights sleep better than having any worries that something may fall on myself or others in bedrooms Ive worked on . I came to this realization after hanging a heavy mirror above the bed in my master only to wake up in the middle of the night to take it down . Luckily there are always options that are also safecan you tell this is a thing with me ? ! ? ! : ) <p> Thank you for this post ! ! I am working on my master bedroom now and am planning a sunburst mirror above . Love the idea of other pieces of art hung over the nightstands . You are always so inspiring to me ! <p> Such great ideas and lovely images for inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I 'll refer back to these ideas . <p> To answer your question Kate I 'd have to say I have a combination of items from your list : there are curtains directly behind my bed and hanging in front of the curtains is a sunburst mirror . But that 's all done to create an illusion of a solid wall behind my bed , which it is not . I have a wonky off-centered **26;704;TOOLONG , window behind our bed . To create the illusion that my windows are logically placed and for symmetry we installed plantation shutters flanking the curtain on both sides . So technically , I guess that 's all behind my bed ! Were really thrilled with the result and how we solved that pesky window problem ! <p> I have my bed in front of my window . I chose against using a headboard or footboard because I wanted the bedding to stand out . I sewed curtains using white seersucker fabric lined with white muslin .

We have a giant photograph of us on our wedding day . I love how our bathroom mirror is across the room , so while we are in bed , we can see the photo hanging above us in the mirror . I love thinking back to the joy and sparkle in our eyesin brings me back to that moment every dayits my favorite house style decision in our house : ) <p> Hi Kassie !

Apparently , 50 Shades infiltrated my psyche , and I have n't even read it yet . <p> Once I picked my mind up out of the gutter , I love your ideas . My 10 yr. old wedding bouquet is above the bed , kind of cool , kind of dusty . I think I can do better : ) Thanks for the inspirations ! <p> some of these scare me even tho they look great !

I prefer to have nothing over my bed ( respresents less stress in my life ) but other beautiful pairs of items around my room . From a Feng Shui perspective , its best to have items in pairs of two ( ex. a picture that has two flowers ) or items that represent romance since the master bedroom is the room of romance . So it you want to spice up your relationship or attract a relationship into your life , focus on a pair of pictures .

I ca n't complain about their functionality , but I am bored with the look of them . I have a hard time justifying a purchase of new doors all around the house just because I want a different look , so I 've decided to do it slowly and budget permitting . <p> The first space where I plan to swap my hollow core builder grade doors for something different is in my home office . I figure since I stare at those closet doors everyday in the space where I work , create , and gather inspiration , it 's worth the upgrade , so I 'll be buying a pair of- doors like these but adding molding to the center make them more interesting . It inspired today 's post with a focus on beautiful paneled cabinet , entry , and interior doors . Some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame dresses up this media cabinet . <p> I recently upgraded our builder grade door with molding too . It was SO simple and yet it had SO much impact . Though , if I had seen all of these options , I might have tried to tackle something that was a little more complicated . Shwew . : ) <p> I had the same feeling about the door in our first home . With no room in the budget for new doors I chose to try it on my own . I came up with a design I liked , purchased molding from HD , cut it to the sizes I needed , painted it and glued it to the doors . My friends all thought I had purchased new doors . <p> Every time I look at real estate , I notice doors .

I 'll be sharing that project in July just as soon as the vines become happy in their new home ! 23100 @qwx883100 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057643 @3257643/ <h> Silver Leaf Vanity Chair <p> By Kate Riley April 13 , 2011 <p> I finally finished up a chair makeover I 've been meaning to get to for awhile . I found this one at a thrift store last year and I bought it specifically for the vanity in my bathroom . I loved the curve of the legs and the size was perfect , but the fabric ? No thank you . It was dingy and stinky so the entire chair definitely needed to be reupholstered . For this piece , I had some fun adding a glamorous feel with a silver leaf finish on the legs , plus I replaced the foam and fabric with a modern geometric . <p> Here 's what it looked like last week . <p> And now . <p> I went back and forth deciding whether to add some tufting with fabric covered buttons , but decided with the glitzy silver leaf and the swirling detail on this Annie Selke Pearls Slate fabric , to skip the tufting this time . <p> I find the best way to understand how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This particular chair was a hint more complicated because of the necessity of tacking strips along the back of the chair . <p> For those who do n't know what they are , tacking strips are a tool used by professionals to create a clean edge with fabric where there is a visible seam . You can find them in fabric stores or order them online too . <p> Stripping an old upholstered piece is time consuming and an icky job . There are always a zillion tacks and staples to pull , and you 'll often find the foam and old batting underneath is disintegrated . Ewww . <p> It took me an hour to get it down to this frame . The springs were in great shape so I left them intact , then gave the visible parts of the frame and the legs a coat of spray gray primer , which is a great base if you 're planning to silver leaf a piece . <p> You get a subtle crinkly texture with silver leaf , but it is a pain in the patootie to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf lamp . However , with the chair , I could n't get the silver leaf to settle in the ridges very well , plus it was shinier than I really wanted , so I used some Silver Leaf ' Rub n Buff over the top to tone down the reflection a bit and fill in the ridges . <p> Then I protected it with my new favorite : wipe on water based Varathane Polyurethane in Satin ' . I found it at OSH and it 's so easy to use . Wipe a small amount on a rag , then wipe the protectant on your piece , easy peasy . <p> The combo of the three led to this finish . <p> Gray primer + silver spray paint could achieve a similar look , but theSilver Leaf ' Rub n Buff creates a muted , hand rubbed sheen that 's so pretty . Once the legs and frame were covered in the silver , I reupholstered the chair with new foam and batting . <p> As an alternative , I could have sewn a slipcover for the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great opportunity to practice some more with tacking strips . If I was going to tuft the chair with fabric covered buttons like this headboard , it would be right at this stage ( creating a hole in that batting of course ) . <p> You can see in the Before ' how the original tufting occurred by pulling the buttons with twine and securing them to the wood frame before sealing the back of the chair with tack strips . <p> To close up the back of the chair , I chose flexible metal tacking strips , also called flexible curve ease , with metal teeth . I found this metal tacking strip at Beacon Fabrics for about $1.50 a yard . <p> With needle nose pliers and a hammer , you attach the strip with 3/4 inch nails ( or upholstery tacks ) . Then you wedge your fabric inside the metal teeth , then fold the teeth over for a clean seam , hammering it closed with a mallet . <p> Finally , I had to hide the stapled edges around the legs . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Sew your own double welt cord , 2 ) Hide the staples with gimp , or 3 ) Cover them with nailhead trim . <p> In this case , I chose pewter nailhead trim to complement the silver leaf finish . To apply nailhead trim , hold them individually in place with needle nose pliers , then use a mallet ( not a hammer ) to gently pound them into the chair . <p> This thrift store chair now sits in my master bathroom . Of course this type of gilding is n't for everyone , but I do like how it adds a touch of Old Hollywood glamour . <p> I think you can add re-upholsterer to your resume at this point . Job well done ! I really like the pattern on the fabric you used . I wonder if maybe the tufting would have blended in and/or been too much ? The silver leaf looks gooooood . : ) <p> Congrats Kate ! ! What a beautiful transformation looks so stylish ! ! I have a question : How do you determine the sizes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you just lay a big piece of fabric say , on the seat , then eyeball how much is required to wrap around the sides then just cut ? ? ? I was wondering how you make sure your pieces are not too small . <p> soooo very pretty ! i love it . and i 'm going to have to try that new wipe on verathane. i 'm always looking for new sealer options .. i feel like its an on-going task to find the right thing ! let me know how it holds up ! ps i 'm doing your trellis wall look yet again for another client this week : ) <p> This is just GORGEOUS ! Thanks for sharing ! I love the fabric choice . I did n't  know you should put nail head trim in with a mallet ! I put some in on my dining chairs and they kept bending . Does the hammer make them bend ? <p> Wow , this is beautiful , Kate ! You make this look so easy . I 've never used tacking strips ( or even knew they existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project just to practice . Wonderful job ; a gorgeous transformation . Well done ! <p> i 'm in the middle of a reupholstery project similar to this one on my blog.im a newbie so i was going to skip the tufting as well . you encouraged me to use the tacking strip now so i may have a go at itive been struggling with that aspect in my brain . THANKS ! ! <p> Awesome ! Seriously , this post is so helpful and its making me feel like wrestling some chairs to the ground and reupholstering them . Thanks for the pointers ( never would have guessed about those tacking strips ) . <p> OH Kate Before I found you I was afraid to paint furniture . I conquered that and learned to embrace spray paint as well ! After this tutorial.I am not afraid to attempt reupholstery . Thank you so much for your wonderful pictures , step by steps , and the ability to help overcome my beginner DIY fears ! ! ! <p> This looks great ! ! I wanted to share with you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dry brush painting technique . Thank you thank you for that awesome DIY !

You also answered a question Ive been wondering aboutpaint legs and wooden parts first and risk the paintjob getting banged up by the upholstery process , or paint wooden parts last and risk getting paint on the new fabric ? Thanks ! <p> I love it ! I would n't have gone for silver leaf on the legs , but I definately would have changed their colour . I 've had so many chairs that needed a new blash of life , and now I can see how to use tacking strips . Thank you . <p> Wow . It really does look gorgeous ! Thank you so much for telling about that tacking strip stuff . I 've done a little bit of reupholstering but did n't  know about that yet . Whoohoo ! My life just got a little better . : D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the reupholstering process not because you did n't  provide a great tutorial ( because you always do ) , but rather because I have extremely limited patience ! : ) <p> Great job on the chair . I just did a similar silver finish on some chairs , but theyll be a guest post on another blog so I cant reveal them quite yet . I 've yet to try the tack strip , but I think that 's coming on one of my next projects . It looks beautiful ! <p> This is absolutely outstanding ! Thank you so much for sharing this lovely project . I apologize in advance for my dumb question , but did you finish the underside of the seat cushion ? I have no idea how to do that . Thanks again and take care ! <p> Absolutely lovely ! You 're right , this chair had such a nice shape but ugly fabric . I am so encouraged by how you see the possibilities in run down furnishings . I 'm working on changing the way I see things . <p> Wow your chair looks amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a facelift , but rigid springs make the seat really uncomfortable . Did you have the same problem ? I 'm wondering if foam and batting would do the trick or if my chair needs more serious help . <p> You 're making me think that maybe I could upholster a chair I have in my living room myself I have the fabric , but I 'm not sure I want to attempt the back myself Might be worth tearing it apart to see how they have it put together hmmmm .. <p> I think your chair is gorgeous , Kate . Very glamorous ! You did a beautiful job and that is stunning fabric . I just finished my first ever chair ! I am many steps behind you in and have lots to learn to produce a beautiful chair like your chair but I had fun and think mine turned out OK for my first one . You are an inspiration with all that you do . <p> Another beautiful piece , Kate . You made this look easy but I 'm sure it was far from it . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in a few years you want to change it up ? Also , did you use foam and batting purchased used specifically for upholstery ? Or did you use quilt batting and less dense foam from a fabric store ? <p> love love love ur worku always get me inspiredim not silver leafing a dresser while i 'm wrting this comment : ) ) ) i have a question when i put the nail head the space between them looks always weird .. how can you achieve this clean look ? thx <p> Hi , Kate Where did you learn to upholster ? I 've looked for a long time for classes , but there are none offered where I live . Can you recommend a book or video , or did you just go at it and learn by trial and error ? I scored a fabulous teak mid-century chair at Goodwill for ( swoon ! ) $5.99 , but according to a local shop , it needs $160 of reupholstering . I 'm thinking of tackling it myself ( eBay was a great source for period-appropriate fabric ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiring ! <p> WOW ! thank you !

May I ask what your opinion is regarding silver leaf on bigger pieces of furniture ? I am searching for a bomb-type chest for my bedroom . I love the shiny/silver guilderdlook , but was wondering if guilding would be difficult and expensive on such a large piece . How do you recommend achieving the look you have on these chair legs on a much bigger piece ? Thanks , Elva <p> Hi Kate , i am an old hand at DIY but being in SA and still having my daytime job , i have not got around to surfing the net too much. , love your work . can i ask a question ? what is silver leaf , is it readily available . i painted a side table with Aluminium paint , the type we used to paint downpipes with years ago . it looks perfect , but gives off . you have to varnish it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products you used in SA. ? thanks 23102 @qwx883102

Oh me oh my , just staring at all the colorful coordinated organization of all this real life stuff makes my heart go Pitter Patter with a capital P. <p> I 've never shown you our floor plan before , here it is . I dug this up out of some old documents from 6 years ago . You can see where our rooms all sit in relation to each other . We have a 2 -+ garage , meaning there are two spots for our cars , and a space to the right for extra stuff . My latest idea is to take over part of our garage to construct a mudroom . <p> Are ya ready to see what the garage looks like now ? Trust me , it 's completely uninspiring . <p> See what I mean ? Yes , that 's the corner of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint supplies , etc . No comment on the mister 's boxing heavy bag , ahem . <p> And as you can see , I am not using this space to its maximum potential . No it is n't pretty , but I have n't been one to complain in years past . We have a decent workbench and a little wine storage cabinet , what more do you need in life ? <p> But I do , oh I do . <p> I have a mudroom on my mind , one that will go here : <p> Now that the kids are growing up and playing a lot of sports , I have no place to store all the gear so I really do want to transform this space into a functioning mudroom . It 's been on my mind for many months now . In my head , I 'm transforming this corner of my garage to work much better for the family . <p> I have visions dancing around in my head of a place to store bulk items and kid gear . Hardwood floors ! Tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen . Plus if I refashion the workbench , I 'll still have a place to putter around on projects and a place for the tool chest too . <p> I 'll need to frame up some walls and the cost of all of my ideas will add up fast , so I entered my mudroom idea in the Arrow Fastener Dream Room Contest " they 're offering someone a chance to win a $10,000 makeover , so I say count me IN . Cause I could build myself one heck of a mudroom with that kind of cash . <p> You could win it too , just like them on Facebook ( click here ) and submit your idea by telling a brief story and uploading an image or two . 23100 @qwx883100 <h> 31 comments <p> Oooo , my fingers are crossed that you 'll win and get your project paid for ! As soon as I glanced at your project plans I was screaming in my head " Do it ! ! " That will be so nice for you and your family . I am dying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that has the potential to be one , but were renting so I cant do anything with it . And as it is now its more or less just a porch that got closed in with windows . No wiring for light fixtures or anything . sigh . Someday I 'll have my perfect mudroom . I hope you get yours much sooner than that ! <p> I 've had the exact same thought about our garage . The wall with the door to our house is definitely not being used to its maximum potential . And , since we always park in the garage , its not the nicest thing to look at when we first come home . Sometimes I think its not worth fixing up so nicely since the rest of the garage always seems quite messy . We store a lot of stuff in there , and its also where I keep all the furniture and other thrifted items I buy in hopes of turning them into something fabulous . But maybe if I did fix up that wall it would motivate me to keep the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And i can sooo see a mudroom in that section of your garage . Someone just told me to turn a portion of our garage into my office or studio for my furniture This post just made me want to do it even more ! $10,000 huh ? hmmmm : ) <p> Ive been thinking of making some built ins for our mess on and off for the last few years , but seriously in the last month . I hope to take a stab at concocting something this winter . Glad to see someone else is out for the same adventure ! <p> I 'd love to enter and steal this from you , but I have absolutely no space for a mudroom . I need it with two ( four-legged ) kids and mechanic husband and all the dirt they bring in , but its just not an option : ( Good luck ! <p> Soo , question . If one had the monies and wherewithall to have one of those there mudrooms , where do you find the cubbies ? Are they custom built ? Or can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture ? <p> Hey Les , I 'd love to have them custom built if I won ! ! ! But I 'm sure there are plenty of DIY solutions , Ana White has a ton of ideas , she 's always inspiring , so we might build them ourselves instead ! Kate <p> I have been dreaming of a mudroom . We do n't  really have a lot of room , but I drew up a plan anyway . It required that we take out the back closet , move the washer and dryer to a different wall ( re-routing the dryer vent and the water ) and , finally , building lockers . I gave the plan to my husband . He looked at me like I had 4 heads . I put my dream on the back shelf and started painting instead . <p> We live in an apartment with an every expanding family and the idea of a mudroom is divine but not a reality . I usually convert a wall near the entrance into a faux mudroom aka easy access for all the kids things ! Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ! I cant wait to see how it turns out . We spend the weekend cleaning out our garage and I 'm doing my best to organize the kids sport stuff and toys . I would love to make room for a mudroom ! <p> Love all the mudroom pics . I have a 2 car garage &amp; its 25 ' deep , so ended up bumping out the rear of the kitchen ( into garage space ) for a butlers pantry . Its the best home improvement I 've accomplished to date ; ) <p> That would be lovely , converting part of the garage . Why do n't  builders put mudrooms in houses and leave out the formal dining rooms , which are useless ? Let 's revolt ! Love all your ideas and pictures . I have quite a stash on Pinterest , which is where I dream of a future mudroom . <p> What is it about looking at organized , pretty mudrooms that makes us all swoon ? I was just thinking about starting a new Pinterest board of mudrooms there are so many drool worthy pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with sports equipment ( and smelly cleats : ) . <p> Your garage looks pretty inspiring to me . You should see mine- stuff from seven sons who play sports and run a neighbourhood lawn mowing business . I 'd love mine to look as tidy , clean and organized as yours does right now . <p> You hit the nail on the head . A mudroom should be a requirement for every home ; like indoor plumbing . I 'm now going to close my eyes and hope that when I open them , the lovely aqua blue mudroom shown in the second picture is waiting for me .. <p> i wish we had the space for one . i have dreamed of knocking out a door on a closet and turning it into one , but it just wont workbecause that 's our only storage in our small town home with no garage , but in the forever house we are dreaming of , there will be a mudroom ! ! go for it ! <p> Do it ! We have the same spot in our garage that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mudroom would connect to the back door on one end and pop through a wall that connects to the front entry on the other end , which will make it ultra functional no matter what door we use to enter the house .

@@99057660 @3257660/ <h> Vinyl vs . Laminate Plank Flooring <p> By Kate Riley February 5 , 2014 <p> My friends , I am up to my ears in plank flooring samples and could use some insight . We want to replace the stained Berber carpet in our studio above the garage and we 're finally ready to tackle replacing the flooring . <p> Originally , I thought we 'd go with hardwood or engineered wood but the more we thought about it , we decided to go with a laminate or vinyl plank flooring . It 's a small studio , not used for anything other than extra storage and styling right now , but it will be occupied by a tenant in the future so we need durable good looking flooring in the bedroom/living area that flows into the kitchen ( seen here ) , and potentially the bathroom ( seen here ) and a product that wo n't break the bank . <p> I 'm drawn to the weathered plank look in grayer tones , and the ones that look and feel more like wood are favored . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products have come in the past few years ! So many of these really do look and feel like wood but bonus for those of us on a budget , they lack that higher price tag . Prices range from $1.50 for more basic products to $4.50 a square foot for more luxury products . We prefer to keep the price as low as possible , do n't we all : ) <p> Thankfully these samples are all the easy click/lock together styles so the replacement does n't require professional installation and is simple enough for us ( or any DIYer ) to tackle . We will have to remove existing baseboards but it 's all very doable with an underlayment and the right supplies . <p> I like the feel of the laminate options , the samples I have are textured and feel more authentic given they 're a faux wood plank product . The boards are longer , the install is simple , but the price point is a little higher . <p> Then there are vinyl plank products , waterproof instead of water resistant so great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thin , lack warmth , and feel more like plastic to the touch . Will these vinyl options hold up better than the laminate ? <p> I 'd love commentary from those of you who have installed and lived with either laminate or vinyl plank wood lookalike flooring . <p> How durable are yours ? Are you satisfied with the look after living with the floors for a period of time ? If they are laminate , how are they handling water in wet areas such as the bathroom or kitchen ? Did you order from a local merchant or from an online source ? Is there a brand of laminate or vinyl plank flooring or company you recommend ? . <h> 163 comments <p> We had textured vinyl in our last house in the entry and kitchen and it way very durable , but it as also very , very hard to keep clean . Dirt and mud catches in the texture and it impossible to get out with a regular mop cleaning . We had to scrub them on our hands and knew with a hard bristle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and I installed the Dream Home Nirvana Plus Delaware Bay Driftwood laminate floor in our bedroom and we absolutely *love* it . This flooring comes with a pre-attached pad , and we purchased an additional underlayment to use . Once we got started , the installation was easy . We installed it over the course of a week in our 13+19 room , but it could easily go in a smaller room in a weekend . We purchased it from Lumber Liquidators : LONG ... <p> While it does not get a huge amount of traffic , it seems to be wearing well and clean up is easy . I truly love the look of it , and I would highly recommend it . I would love to put it in my kitchen , too ! Hope that is helpful good luck in your search ! <p> We put sheet vinyl that looks like wood in our remodeled bath because it it water proof and it comes in one piece . Its usually 12ft wide by as long as you want it . Its pretty thick and easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one we purchased has a 25 yr warranty against scratches , peeling or other damage . Not deep grooves , but some and easy to clean with mop , also it wont hold viruses or bacteria . This is why they are putting it on floors in most hospitals now , very durable and looks like wood . So far so great after 6 yrs now . Good luck ! <p> We installed laminate in 2 bathrooms about 10 years ago , and found it to be practical in these little used areas . it was also a dark , non-shiny laminate so did n't  show scratches . But the laminate we inherited in our rental condo was light on colour and shiny , so dirt that settled in scratches really showed up and made the laminate look shabby . We replaced it with self adhesive tiles that look like ceramic , and are much more practical in a kitchen than the laminate . However the laminate that you show in your post looks much nicer than anything I have ever seen so I hope someone comes along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laminate on the full first floor of our house including our powder room . It has held up well but I am not sure I would want that much moisture if it had a bathtub or a messy kid dropping water on it all the time . We installed Vinyl in the two baths upstairs to get a wood look but durability . They are GREAT . They look very much like real wood and are very tough . I never worry about bathwater splashing or any messes . My friends say they look like the real deal . Installation was a breeze . We ordered ours from Lowes . <p> We installed both in our last house . We put the vinyl planks in our bathrooms and they held up great . Super easy install , super easy to clean , and did not show any wear at all . We bought those floors from HD I believe they were by Shaw ? The laminate flooring we installed throughout the rest of the house . We have 2 young kids , a dog , and a cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender footed either . They held up wonderfully . Toys dropped and dragged , high heels , dog and cat spin outs , ride on toys , spills , you name it it happened on those floors . They looked brand new whenwe left . We got them from Menards on a super sale . Our new home needs all new flooring and we are going with laminate again . It was so easy to keep clean and looked great . We are researching a few brands and were thinking about ordering from Build Direct . Anyone have experience with them ? The samples we have ordered look very nice . <p> We installed vinyl plank flooring throughout the entire first floor of our house ( living room , dining room , bathroom , master , and kitchen ) about a year ago . I really like it . I do n't  have to worry too much about it with my dogs and kids . I liked that we did n't  have to put an underlayment under it . It was installed right on the subfloor . With laminate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  go with a more expensive one , your floors get that click clack sound when you walk on them . I like that the planks each look like a single piece of wood and that they are wide . Overall , I think we made a really good choice to go with vinyl . It was probably the cheapest non-carpet option and I like that I was able to put it throughout the first floor of the house so that everything flows together well . We got ours at Home Depot during a Black Friday sale and paid about $.99 a square foot . It is Allure brand in Oak . <p> I have both laminate and vinyl in my home , and did the installation of both on my own . The laminate is in our living room , and the install was fairly quick and it has held up pretty well . There are some nicks here and there that I notice and I 'm not sure exactly what caused them . The nice thing is that the dogs nails have not caused damage like I 'm sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trim and edge pieces were not as good of quality as I would have liked . I used vinyl planks in our main bathroom . Again , the install was super fast , they were really cheap , and overall I like the look . The problem I have is shifting . I think you need to make sure to have a really solid edge so there is nowhere for the floor to give . I have two doors into the bathroom , both with carpet , and this has allowed some of the planks to slide causing gaps in some areas . I would definitely use again for the cost effectiveness and appearance , but I would do the install differently to ensure no gaps . Hope that helps ! <p> What timing ! We are in the middle of our first-ever renovation and its installing laminate plank flooring ! Its going well so fareasy to put together ( once you get past the first row ! ) . A little tip for your selection process : laminate comes in levels or AC ratings . AC 5 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one we went with is an AC 4 as we could n't find a finish we liked . Considered the highest quality for residential areas and including a 25 year transferable warranty , the AC-4 has been good to us so far . I 've even taken an exacto knife to it and could n't make a mark when trying to ! Know that there are n't  as many " transition " pieces for laminate as there is for hardwood . We purchased our flooring from Home Depot and with the underpad , it came to $2.77 per square foot . The best part , we showed family and friends our sample and they did n't  believe us when we told them it was laminate ! <p> We built a new home in 2013 with Adura vinyl flooring . I never thought I would have vinyl in my home , but we love this stuff ! We get compliments on it all the time and most people have no idea it is vinyl . We have the Adura Dockside in Sea Shell which is a weathered grey and it is goes beautifully with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey with espresso colored wood tones . <p> We have vinyl planks in 1/3 of our house . The look good and have held up greatBUT we bought the thinner flexible ones , and after a few months of use these small bubbles popped up EVERYWHERE . We cut through a few of the seams to see what was happening , SINGLE pieces of sand . It is like the princess and the pea . One piece of sand is big enough that the thin flooring caves to the shape of it . We cleaned our floors by vacuum and mop before install and kept a broom on hand during install . I do n't  know how we could have been any cleaner . <p> Also , if any of your options leave a gapwhen we bought the house they had just put in peel and stick tiles with a small fake grout that leaves a gap.it is the bain of my existence . The gap gets sooo dirty and cant just be mopped or vacuumed , we scrape that gap clean about once a year on our hands an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had done this once and noted how bad our floors looked and tried to mopshe couldnt believe that as much as people rave about peel and stick you basically always have a dirty floor . <p> We have vinyl planks in 1/3 of our house .

My mom came over about a month after we had done this once and noted how bad our floors looked and tried to mopshe couldnt believe that as much as people rave about peel and stick you basically always have a dirty floor . <p> I went through this same dilemma during a remodel at our small vacation cabin . The contractors vote was laminate planks instead of the vinyl ones . I was surprised also at how nice they both looked . In my gut , I thought vinyl would be the best for easiness of care . My daughter has laminate and it shows every footprint whether barefoot or shoes . But , he was convincing and I went with the laminate . You should always go with your gut ! They are beautiful but the cabin is almost all windows and I drive myself crazy trying to keep them looking nice with people/kids going in and out all the time . I have a friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . No matter what I 've tried , after a damp ( do n't  use water to mop ) mop or Swifter or vacuuming , there is still a haze on the floor until someone walks on it and then there are footprints . If there is not a lot of natural light in your room , the laminate may do fine . They are both good choices as far as the look is concerned . I wish I had chosen the vinyl ! Let us know what you decide ! Good luck ! <p> We installed Karndean vinyl wood floors on the first floor of our home and we LOVE them . My husband and I were hard to sell on them . We thought it would look cheap . Plus when people ask if they are wood floors , would we feel silly by saying they were vinyl floors . But let me tell you , vinyl floors have come such a long way . <p> First off , they look like real wood but without the wear and tear . At the flooring shop my husband literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would scratch . Previously we had bamboo wood floors in our old home and with two 80lb dogs , our floors were DESTROYED . We were not going back there . With our vinyl , our dogs have n't even caused a scratch in our floors . The way they were installed ( attached directly to the floor ) the sound that comes from walking on them is much more solid sounding . They clean incredibly easy . We have them in our half bath and laundry room and havent had any issue . If we did n't  have dogs , we would have had wood floors , but since I ca n't live without them , vinyl will be my only option between the alternatives . <p> I will say that we have ceramic wood tiles floors in our master bath . I LOVE them as well . We live up North and houses do n't  do ceramic tiles throughout the house and we were thinking resale . If we live down south , I would have seriously considered doing that in our whole house . <p> We recently looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be completely level or you 'll wind up with pockets underneath that you 'll feel when you walk on it . Our house is quirky , so we decided on vinyl tile ( laundry room ) , but something to keep in mind . Ca n't wait to see what you choose and the final outcome ! <p> A few years ago , I worked as an inside sales/office admin assistant for a family owned flooring company . We serviced an area of the country that was heavy on beach rentals and family homes . I was trained on new products by the area sales reps and then would relay the information to our outside store sales associates . I recall the vinyl strips being the lowest cost per sq ft for the material itself so it was often a popular initial choice for a tight budget . However , the key with that stuff is that you really need a smooth-as-glass subfloor prep work , or every little bump , dimple , air pocket will telegraph through like a bad contact paper/shelf liner job . The adhesive at the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for someone who may not have much skill in applying with the proper trowel notch size , too . We always seemed to have to order more floor leveler and adhesive for the DIY customers and that would add up their overall budget , as well . The material is GREAT though for easy cleanup of spills and overall durability . Since the laminate is a floating floor , there is no adhesive and nearly zero prepwork , unless you wanted to put down additional moisture barrier or sound proofing . It does have a slight hollow sound , but not much louder than a solid or engineered hardwood . It handles foot traffic well , but not a friend of moisture , as it buckles if exposed to moisture long term , like in a bathroom or kitchen with a leaky dishwasher . Hope that helps ! <p> We installed HD Allure vinyl plank throughout our finished basement and I 'd definately recommend it to others . We 've had water issues in our basement before so a waterproof product was an important factor . I was worried that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its actually suprisingly warm even right over our concrete subfloor . It has a little texture too it too which adds to its realistic touch and keeps it from feeling too plasticy . <p> My husband and I have been debating the very same thing for our basement . We installed laminate throughout our first floor ( living/dining room and kitchen and entryway ) and really like it as far as durability and cleanup go- we have 3 kids and a lab , and have had no issues with scratching . Our is a textured laminate from lumber liquidators . Our only issue is that we chose a dark color and everything shows ! I can mop the floor , and the next day it looks dirty again . <p> I wanted to ask , do you think the whole grey/weathered look will be outdated soon ? Not asking to be snarky , but because we are considering the weathered look- or a lighter wood look for the basement in hopes it would n't show as much dirt/footprints etc . We want something that will last a while ! <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over 30 years and laminate is by far one of the top sellers . Vinyl plank is still somewhat new to the retail industry , its been popular and successful in commercial settings . Every manufacturer is different , but weve yet to find a vinyl plank flooring from any manufacturer that well stand behind 100% . We 've had call backs for the finish scratching easily , scuffing , a weird residue on that wo n't clean well , and telegraphing because the product is thin . That 's just been our experience . As long as you have a good quality laminate ( look at 9MM and above ) you should n't have a problem with water in a kitchen , only if you end up with a plumbing issue ( dishwasher breaking , etc ) . We do n't  typically recommend laminate in bathrooms that have showers because the flooring could warp in high moisture . Manufacturers do n't  usually warrant the product if its installed in a bathroom , but we 've seen people do it . <p> Hi ! I follow your blog daily ! I am also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down recommend the LVP , Luxury Vinyl Planks , for a million reasons . I sell Vinyl 10 to 1 . Good luck ! Casey <p> We installed luxury vinyl in our kitchen , living room , entryway , hall and laundry room because we were told it would be a good durable option for my husband who is in a wheel chair . Hardwood would have been our preference , but cost and durability ruled it out . We chose a dark walnut color and you have to look very closely to tell that it is not hardwood . It looks beautiful and we 've been very happy with it so far . We 've dropped many things on the floor and it has not dinged at all , however , it does seem to scratch easily if anything is dragged across it . Luckily , the scratches are easily remedied with a wood stain pen . We were also advised not to use a vacuum with moving plastic parts on it for risk of scratching as well . Overall , we are very happy with them . <p> I installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once its in , it does n't  feel plasticky , and it looks just as good as many of the laminates . Ive been very pleased with it . I love the gray wash look you 've got here ! <p> We used the wood-look laminate flooring in our previous house . We have two dogs , and a kid and it held up great . We lived in the house for six years and the floors looked great when we left . I dropped a platter from the top of the fridge onto the floor almost right after they were installed , and it did make a scratch / gouge in the floor where the sharp edge of the busted platter hit . I panicked and frantically searched our basement for something that might be the same color . I found some stain that was almost an exact match rubbed it on wiped it off and I swear you would never know the scratch was there . We have hand scraped bamboo floors in our existing home , and full disclosure . I miss the ease and durability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and the laminate is holding up beautifully . <p> Cheap laminate in the bedrooms and hallway . It has held up well other than leaving a damp cloth on it when painting , causing it to swell in that spot . <p> Last year I installed Allure vinyl plank flooring in my kitchen , which was purchased at HD . It was easy to lay and has held up to a water leak , the daily abuse that a kitchen takes and I 'm not all that keen on spending all of my time cleaning ; the vinyl is perfect for that . I used the type that has a lip of sticky material and there has been some shifting , fortunately it was in a not too noticable spot . I plan to install the vinyl in my dining room this weekend , but this time will take the advice of the manufacturer and rent a weighted roller . <p> I do like the washed wood look , but IMHO it will date itself quickly as being from the early 2010s . Rich wood tones never go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole main floor and I LOVE it . It feels warm underfoot and looks fantastic ( I also went for a weathered look ) and it is indestructible . Water , kids , pets , nothing makes a mark . <p> In our last home we installed laminate and while it looks great too , after only a week our cat knocked a vase off a table and when it broke on the floor it gouged it and left a mark that we could never fix . Laminate is just layers of paper and once the top layer is damaged , there is no fix . That is not the case with vinyl . <p> Especially because you might rent it out , vinyl will last longer and wont be as easily damaged . <p> I have both in my home . The vinyl we installed ourselves in the basement . Pretty easy looked great at the start but oh my , it scratches soooo easily ! ! ! ! ! ! And trying to remove them is such a pain ! So when we renovated my kitchen , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I would n't budge since I showed him what my vinyl in the basement now looked like . I asked the flooring guy if he can give me a product that could easily remove the scratches I would go for the vinyl right away , but even he was shocked ( scratches by the way were only from shoes ! ) . So I ended up with laminate with my kitchen and I am very happy so far . Is it scratch-proof ? No , but definitely less and definitely easily to clean . Good luck Kate ! <p> We installed laminate on our whole main floor and am so happy we did ! Holds up great to three dogs and a toddler . We also installed darker floors , and I would never do that again either . Shows too much ! <p> The house we bought has laminate in the bathroom . We are looking at replacing it because it has swelled in places it has evidently gotten wet and also there are weird white filmy spots in places on the top layer . Its also splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing with laminate . <p> I 'm not sure if there is a difference in weight in these two products , but you should definitely check on that . Quite often garages are not designed to hold as much weight on a second floor as a house is , and you might need some structural bracing ( not usually too expensive ) if one of the products is as heavy as a wood floor would be . Before upgrading to wood throughout ( except bathrooms ) our house , we had a structural engineer buy off on adding it , luckily without additional support . That same engineer had us add considerable bracing before adding a rooftop deck . <p> Oh man , I could write a book on this subject ! I had laminate flooring put in 5 areas of the house we bought 4 years ago and it is probably the biggest and most expensive mistake I have ever made . I hate my laminate . Detest it ! After living with it , I do not understand why laminate is so popular . Laminate is slippery and noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we first had it installed , we had 3 big German Shepherds ( which have now all passed ) . The sound of their 48 toenails constantly clicking across our laminate floors was enough to drive me and my husband crazy . It was also really hard for the dogs to walk on . In their final days , when they became less agile and more arthritic , I had to put down throw rugs in all the pathways just so they could get the traction to move from room to room . There were even a couple times I slipped and nearly fell wearing shoes with slippery soles . Now I only go barefooted or wear rubber-soled shoes around the house . <p> Although my laminate was more than $4.00/sq. ft. , it is basically just like layers of pressed cardboard with a pretty faux wood looking top layer . The slightest bit of moisture is Enemy #1 of my laminate . Pet urine , vomit , sloppy water bowl drinkers etc. , can leave moisture on the floor that will make the laminate seams bubble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , who has a very sensitive stomach , threw up in the foyer and I did n't  find it right away so I have bubbled seams there . I had an undetected leak under the threshold of the back door so before I knew it , the laminate started to badly bubble there and the top layer has started to peel too . I also have the laminate in my kitchen ( big mistake ) and there are plenty of bubbled seams from little spills around the sink , drips from wet hands or dishes , rogue ice cubes that have dropped out of the refrigerator door dispenser after we 've walked away and werent picked up right away etc . Once water gets down underneath that top layer , its just like a cancer that eats away at it . For all the people who rave about their laminate , I would be curious to know what brands they have . Mine is Columbia Clic made by Columbia Flooring so if you go the laminate route , I would recommend you avoid that brand like the plague . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  scratch and it does n't  show the dirt but beyond that , I do n't  have one positive thing to say about laminate after living with it . <p> On the other hand , I have Trafficmaster Allure wood-look vinyl planks ( sold at Home Depot ) in one bathroom and LOVE it . Allure is very budget friendly ( around $2.00/sq. ft. ) , soft and quiet to walk on , extremely easy to care for , easy to DIY , and water resistant . ( They have also come out with a waterproof version that I believe is called " Ultra . " ) As soon as my budget allows , all my laminate will all be ripped out and I will be replacing it with vinyl planks . <p> Is the CABANA brand in the top pic vinyl or laminate ? Personally I know tons of people that have done laminate &amp; loved it , and people that have not liked vinyl so much , but I find the CABANA the most aesthetically pleasing ! <p> We installed espresso laminate flooring in wide planks in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hallways . We purchased ours from BuildDirect.com really happy with their service , price ( negotiate for a better price ! ) , and the free samples are great . It held up perfectly everywhere , even in the kitchen ! There was no damage at all from water from the dishwasher/sink , if we happened to spill a large amount obviously we 'd wipe it up but never an issue . The only thing I did not like was the color they were too dark and showed every speck of dust but that would happen with any dark floor ! I like your choices you have so far , very unique ! <p> We installed wide planked laminate flooring in our basement about a year ago . We have a kitchenette , full bathroom and laundry room in our basement , and its also the main entrance to our backyard from the house , so we needed something that would be durable and be able to withstand moisture . We got the store brand laminate that Home Depot sells , and had their contractors install it , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly I 'd imagine that it would be an easy DIY install . So far , its holding up great despite it being a high foot-traffic area , and we absolutely LOVE the way it looks . Its very easy to keep clean , and it has a medium gloss and grain which make it look very much like hardwood . <p> We had laminate flooring installed in our last house and I hated it from the get go . It was difficult to keep clean and with 3 dogs the sound of their paws as they walked across the floor was slightly annoying . I grew up with real wood floors in our home and have probably over-romanticized the sound of my moms high heels as she got ready for church on Sundays . We are saving our pennies now to install wood plank flooring in our current housethe real stuff . Sorry to be a downer on your choices but I 'd rather have exactly what I want even if it means I have to wait a little longer . Hope you come to a decision soon ! <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attached pad on the back . We did the installation ourselves . It is in my living room and runs down the hallway . I purchased from Lumber Liquidators at around 2.99 a square foot ( on sale-this was the BEST laminate they sold at the time ) . When I originally went in I would not have even considered laminate , as to me I thought it would look and feel cheap . After discussing the durability ( I have two younger children ) and the price point , I was sold . We laid the flooring over stained concrete , with a vapor barrier . The instillation took us 2 days and I LOVE the result . Weve lived with it for about 3 years now . Our wood tone is neither light nor too dark , so you do n't  see EVERY speck of dust . The handscraped look does not look AS authentic as it does with natural wood , but I was worried that it would look like cheap laminate without it , so I think its a matter of preference . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most trafficed area , the seams where the ends butt up against eachother ( not the tounge and groove , but the width of the boards ) are startign to space out . I 'm not sure if its the exceptionally cold weather , or if we did not install it properly . I 've not yet started to research how to fix this . So hopfully it will not be a complete pain to address , but for the price , easy maintainability , and the warmth it has brought to my home I love it and would purchase again . <p> All of your samples are very nice ! My only concern is that the room is over a garage and in the winter the floors will be very cold without the carpet or in floor heating . We built a new house with plenty of insulation and we had to install carpet over the hardwood floors in the bedroom over the garage because of how cold the floors would get . Hope this helps ! <p> We have Lowes gray vinyl plank which ran us 1.79 per sqft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband , a former gen. contractor , insisted on the adhesive planks for easy removal and replacement . We have kids + dogs , so we do anticipate eventual floor damage lol . He said even though you can replace just one plank of the click-lock stuff , you typically have to pull up more than just the affected piece to do so . Best of luck with your search ! <p> We inherited laminate in the kitchen , hallway and powder room from the previous owners . Not the nice looking kind you 're considering , but it was not in our budget to immediately replace them . Then a tiny disaster struck : without us realizing it , the toilet was leaking at the back , just a tiny bit . We did n't  notice it until the floor started to look a bit wobbly . After removing the laminate , we had to remove a big part of the floor underneath as well , completely destroyed . We replaced the laminate floor in the powder room with tile , and I cant wait to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was cheap or poorly laid , I do n't  know . I would think twice before putting laminate floors in bathrooms ! <p> We just installed laminate wood floors we purchased from home depot and replaced our carpet . We love it ! Looks amazing and people do n't  even realize it is not real wood . When we saw it online , I was skeptical especially for the price , but when I saw it in personit was awesome . Has n't  scratched yet and was easy to install . It did make the floors much colder on your feet , but it has also been an exceptionally cold winter for us this year too ! <p> We recently DIYed our laminate flooring on the entire main floor of our house . We love it ! It did take our dog about a week to get used to walking on it , but he s doing well now , plus we plan on adding a rug in the living room area so that will help as well ( he s just a lil guy ) . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO easily on the laminate but furniture feet grippers will remedy that . I am also a bit narotic of liquid spills on the floor but its subsiding . Before we bought ours I put it through every type of scratch/dent test possible and the only marks I could make on it were if I stabbed it as hard as I could with the point of a key . My parents have also had laminate in their kitchen/dining area for over a year and love it . <p> I installed vinyl plank from End of the Roll on both levels of my townhouse , and I 'm thrilled . ( I did carpet on the stairs and upstairs hallway . ) It looks and feels fantastic , and there 's no sound when my dog and cat stomp around . Its had spills and cleans up nicely . Im sold ! After having it installed I needed new baseboards , which turned into new paint in one room , new fireplace tile and so on . : ) <p> I work for a homebuilder and the trick with these floors is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound when you walk across it , i.e. it wont sound as hollow . This is a common complaint that it does n't  " sound " like real wood . Also would n't recommend it for wet areas because it can warp if soaked . Spot clean instead of mop . <p> was all set to put in the HD Allure plank flooring , and then the contractor realized it was special order and we did n't  have time to wait . ( this was a refresh of a sheet linoleum on a pipe burst during the cold snap down south ) anyway , we had to go quickly with something else , and he picked out for me a vinyl plank that is glue down . i LOVE itpeople think its hardwood , and yet it wears so well.the boys have run every toy on it possible . we do n't  do shoes in the house , so our dirt will be more dust than dirt , and it is textured , but even so , i just wipe it right down with a damp cloth . it is Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of choosing waterproof flooring for our basement . I settled on vinyl plank , and then a contractor mentioned a newer sheet vinyl/fiberglass flooring . Sobella by Mannington. **41;772;TOOLONG It has cushioning and really looks like wood planks or tiles . I 'm pretty sure well be going with this now since I like the idea of more cushioning . I will be curious on what you decide ! <p> I have laminate peel and stick in my living room that the previous owners put in . I highly recommend it , with a dog and a toddler it is super durable . The prevoius owners had a box in the attic and we found more and were able to continue the floor into a hallway and laundry room . My husband used his ab roller to help press the planks down so he got a great ab workout in the process . We 've had a couple of planks pop up due to seepage , we dried them off and put some glue on them and they went right back down without any issues . <p> I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading all of these comments . Some love it . Some hate it . Some recommend the vinyl . Others the laminate . I guess we just have to get what we want and then LIVE with it <p> The problem is that there are different quality service for the same thing . All laminates are not created equally and neither are the vinyl . I have lived in many houses and we 've tried different things due to cost ato the time , plus my husband was a contractor for awhile so we put flooring into others homes and have done some commercial as well . The laminate is fake pressed paper and will buckle with water spills that do n't  get wiped up immediately , especially in humid areas . We lived in Indiana and Utah . It is loud and the dogs nails done make a lot of noise on it . We slept in my sister in laws basement for 3 long miserable months listening to 2 dogs and 2 kids shoes upstairs . If it is very expensive thick laminate it is much nicer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter , and helps to make it much warmer on cement floors . Its easy to clean and scratch resistant but will still chip off esp on the seams . It will separate if not put in tight enough to the wall . But you are supposed to have a little wiggle room because it contracts and expands due to weather . So its hard to always get that right for a DIY floor . Overall , its Much better than carpet , but do n't  like it . The peel and stick pvc tiles that are newer are great if you are looking at the kind that looks like tile and is pretty thick . ( Not the cheap thin stuff , its terrible quality ) We put it in the basement of a whole apartment complex due to previous water issues . It was easy to put directly down on the cement . The grout was thinking and soupy and did n't  work at first , my husband had to thicken it up and redo a whole room , then it was perfect . We lived there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked perfect when we moved out a year later . No one knew it was not real tile . Its much warmer than porcelain tile and not as slippery . The vinyl plank flooring has gotten SO much better in quality . Be sure to get a harder thicker kind . The first stuff that came out for residential use was very easy to scratch from furniture etc . It was very thin . It looked great and easy to clean and install but the scratches were terrible . The new stuff is thicker and much more durable , try to scratch the surface of a sample and you will see the difference in quality immediately . These reviews are personal without much detail to the kinds of product used . I have n't kept track over the past 20 years and at least that many houses . But there are HUGE differences in quality and we 've always bought lower end due ton cost . We are about to do 90% of the house we just purchased in vinyl planks due to look , but mostly for durability with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile in the kitchen but I do not . I hate cleaning the grout . He just likes the look . We will see who wins , lol . <p> Hi Kate ! It was a year ago , we were having the same issue in making a decision with our floors connecting four rooms ; of major concern being the kitchen and laundry closet at then end of our kitchen . We looked at samples , recommendations online , consumer comments , etc. , we choose the vinyl ( Armstrong ) . It looks just good as the day it was installed , easy to clean , and does excellent when you have a water leak . We replaced our washer and dryer with LG products two weeks after the floor was installed . The vinyl still looks perfect in that laundry closet. , no warping or nothing . We could be more pleased . <p> P.S. Five years ago , my husband installed the laminate flooring in our downstairs half bath , only to remove it 3 months later with a water leak when the floor buckled : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark laminate floors in my entryway , kitchen , den , and dining room 2 years ago ( do n't  remember the brand but we bought it at HD ) . It was my first DIY project ever and it was soooo easy ! I havent had any problems with water/buckling . I have a toddler and 130 pound dogspills and vomit happen , but it does n't  show on the laminate even if I do n't  take care of it right away . But we live in AZ so its super dry hereI think people living in more humid places may have more problems than I ever would . It scratches easier than my last bamboo floors did , but I keep Old English scratch cover handy and it works great . My husband thinks its too loud even with the expensive underlaymentdefinitely louder than the bamboobut its never bothered me . The dark floors show more dog hair , so I sweep more than I did with light bamboo . My laminate looks a lot like real wood . All in all , I would do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . We originally had vinyl plank flooring downstairs in our living room , kitchen and half bath . It was great for resisting water , looked nice and was easy to clean . My complaints are that it felt very hard , like walking on concrete , and if it is laid over anything like dirt , sand , etc. you will feel it when you walk over it . The floor underneath has to be completely smooth and free of all dirt and dust . <p> We ended up putting down a laminate floor from lumber liquidators ( I believe a Dream Home brand ) . This was softer to walk on , just as easy to clean , and it hid the bumps in the vinyl flooring . ( It was laid directly on top of it ) If water set for any extended period of time , yes it would bubble . I have two dogs and any accidents would need to be cleaned up immediately . I would be really hesitant to put the laminate in a bathroom and kitchen , especially with a tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-look tile planks , but have kept laminate throughout the upstairs , minus bathrooms . We have had it for almost 5 years and it has held up great . <p> We installed a beachy look vinyl floor in our living room and dining a couple of years ago . I wish I could remember the brand but they were more expensive than the vinyls at HD and Lowes . What I liked about the planks is that the sticky section is only on two sides , one long and one short . So it was really like a floating floor when installed . The planks were very heavy and durable . As far as looks , nobody can believe that my floor is vinyl ! Everyone asks me when we had our floors done , haha . The floor is grayish , blueish , knotty , grooved.just beautiful ! I want to install in the kitchen before they discontinue them . Good luck with your decision ! <p> For us , its all about lifestyle . We have a small dog . Though laminate is difficult to scratch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not always the case , as you definitely get what you pay for in both categories . <p> I definitely suggest a click together vinyl , ( though the Karndean product mentioned earlier does hold up really well at work ) , for ease of DIY , and that it does n't  gap . We find it significantly easier to install . I did hate the Allure from HD ( it gaps , and if you put a piece down wrong , it does n't  give you the ability to adjust without ruining the bonding ability ) , however , we went to a local flooring store , and chose a luxury vinyl plank that clicks together . <p> I hands down prefer the new vinyl to anything else we 've lived on . The ability to resist water means that it is n't tragic if the dog comes in with snow or wet paws ( as with our laminate ) . Its also much quieter . We use Armstrong Once n Done to clean it , and we have n't seen any of the " film " other people have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my craft room/studio and we absolutely love it ! ! I could n't believe how much they look like the real thing and mine are 100% waterproof . I paint in that space and wanted the most durable floor I could get and I went with the vinyl . I actually think you have a sample of the exact floor in your image from Build Direct . We have had no issues and its the best decision we made in the space . Good luck ! <p> Kate I love the choices you have made , both laminate and vinyl ! I lived with laminate and said I would n't do it again I did n't  like the noise and it did scratch and knick . Sofast forward many years and now in a different home , I researched laminate as I thought it had probably changed a lot since I had lived with it . A flooring representative was completely honest with me , since I did n't  like the sound . She said that to get rid of the sound I would need to buy a commercial grade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that of hand scraped hardwood ! But againthe sound just happens to be my pet peeve : ) I really like the vinyl , especially the sample on the left , but as with everything you have to weigh the pros and cons ! Good luck I 'm completely confident of one thing whatever choice you make it will look amazing ! ! <p> We installed the Allure vinyl plank flooring in our master bath 2 1/2 years ago &amp; I love it . I intend to put it in all our bathrooms . It is economical and easy to install . We have had no problems with shifting or bubbling . I clean it with a steam mop , and it looks brand new . Highly recommend . <p> My favorite is the second sample in from the left on the top row . ( in the first picture ) . Do n't  know if its laminate or vinyl , but it is my favorite as far as " looks " . <p> We installed off the shelf laminate plank wood-look-alike flooring 8 months ago in a remodel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did n't  even use a salesman , I just shopped online , then we looked at it in person at the store to make sure we liked it , then came home , ordered online , and it was delivered and unloaded to our door . It was soooooo easy to install , we put it in ourselves my husband and I and neither of us had ever done a floor before . We installed around 900 square feet , that was the dining room , kitchen , laundry room , mudroom , and side entryway . After living with it for 8 months I still love it ! It takes a beating and keeps on looking great ! We have regular tricycle races on it , spilled milk/water at the dinner table , muddy/wet boots by the entryway , a washer that shakes and moves a solid 6 inches to the right every cycle , and of course the water droplets that you just cant avoid around the sink and dishwasher . With all this abuse , the floors still look like new . I have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there forever great ! " just to whip out my Swiffer mop and it disappears and the floors look like new . I cant say enough good about the laminate plank floors ! <p> We moved into the house 2 years ago and first thing installed vinyl tiles in this area . I do n't  know how vinyl tiles compare to vinyl planks , but needless to say they were so horrible that is why we replaced them with the laminate planks . The tops peeled off like it was a piece of paper peeling off , the seams were hideous and they were so pliable that you could n't even mop them . You had to scrub with a sponge onhands and knees because the flat mop would n't make contact with the whole piece . They were flat gross ! <p> My in-laws have Pergo laminate in there cabin . They have tons of foot traffic , dirt , snow , grandkids food spills , etc. and they still look new after 8 years . They went with a mid-tone color so it does n't  show footprints . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-6 years ago . It was pricey , probably $4.00/sq ft , maybe a bit more , and we installed it ourselves . The dark wood-look we put in the halls I love , but its very noisy . The dogs nails click loudly on it and sneaking down the hall to check on the baby at night is next to impossible . The stone tile look we put in the kitchen has just not held up well at all . There is a huge chip near my sink from where I dropped something on it that is now a big divot as the wood pulp/paper backing has worn away . I see it every day and it drives me nuts . There are other chips in the kitchen floor as well , and the texture makes it hard to clean . The color hides most of the dirt but getting it really clean with laminate-safe cleaners is a chore . If I had to do it again , I would go with engineered or solid pre-finished hardwood in the halls and either vinyl plank or cork in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we do a full kitchen remodel . In fact , that 's how we justified the cost of it , but its got to go . <p> We put in a high quality Shaw laminate in our entry , kitchen , family room and hall about 10 years ago . We also put in the highest quality under-layment which made a big difference in not having that hollow " clicking " sound . We have some damage ( bubbling ) from a leaking cooler , and ice maker . I would not recommend laminate in any area that could get wet . We are very vigilent about dropped ice cubes , or splatters near the sink and dishwasher . My sister installed vinyl in her condo kitchen and foyer , and it is beautiful ! If I had to do it over , if I could n't have good quality hardwood , I would go with the vinyl . <p> We are in the same boat currently . After a lengthy discussion with our flooring guy , he had a suggestion a new product for us . Rubber flooring ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and this product is indestructible and looks so good . I was a total doubter but once i saw the floor samples and felt them , they are just like the vinyl , texture and everything . Best part , great for DIYer ( snap and lock ) AND they run around LONG ... <p> Vinyl . Vinyl . Vinyl . We have laminate in our apartment and had 2 water leaks , one from the washer and one from our kitchen sink . The tiniest bit of water caused a SERIOUS issue and the nice clean laminate top bubbled up and away from the boards it was attached to . We eventually had to replace an area twice as large as the actual leak because of teeny tiny bubbles where the water had tracked along the grooves . If there is ANY chance of liquids spilling on the floor , laminate is definitely not the way to go . <p> Yay Ive been waiting for this post ! I am now More confused than ever lol ! We have laminate not Happy with it scratches easily its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easily damaged We now need to replace and have been really considering luxury Vinyl Plank hardwood is my top choice but not in the budget . Im surprised no one has mentioned Duchateu brand . What brands/colors Kate are you considering in your samples above in the vinyl ? <p> My husband and I have installed vinyl wood planks in our front entry way . We decided that these would be better with all the wet shoes/dirty boots that would come in contact with the floor . We have not had any problems with them at all ! They look great and are very durable and easy to clean . You can read more about our floors here : LONG ... <p> I used a LVT plank from Armstrong in a commercial application and my client loves it . Since I had never used LVT before I did a lot of research before recommending it to my client . The one I chose was a weathered wood look and is looks very similar to the ones you picked . I also learned after ordering it that I chose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Northeast stores . I cant comment on the noise factor , but I can tell you that my client is thrilled with it , and I can only assume that Starbucks is too or they would n't have ordered so much ! My only warning to you is that Armstrong recommends only installing over a completely level floor . We installed over a concrete base , and had to have it leveled before we could install . <p> wow ! I 'm loving all these stories from home owners ! Lots of great info to consider . If I had make a choice I would have to say -neither . Another option I would recommend , but of course is pricier would be the tiles that look like wood . That being said I do know that Cyndy from Creativity Exchange recently installed the vinyl planks in her office and raved about them . You can read her review LONG ... Good luck ! and cant wait to hear what you choose ! <p> I also have the Adura Dockside in Sea Shell and I LOVE it ! I purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in all of her dog suites . It has a great warranty and is easier to install than vinyl because you do n't  need a saw ! ! ! You can also lay WITHOUT underlayment provided your subfloor meets the specified requirements . I installed the less expensive Home Depot vinyl in my hallway bathroom and I like it too , it was considerably cheaper . It does n't  look as real and it was harder to install because the sticky stuff is SUPER sticky and if you make a mistake you cant just pull the piece up and put it back down . It also scratched fairly easy . here 's a peek at my Adura Dockside in Sea Shell floor that is in my master bath and soon to go in my hallway and kitchen . LONG ... <p> I purchased the floor online and they offered free shipping if you order over a certain amount . email if you want more info on the site . <p> We put vinyl plank flooring down in our 1st home that was located in a busy college town . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We knew that when selling our house ( which we knew we would be doing relatively soon ) there would be a good chance it would be bought as a rental property . Our lab puppy grew up with the floors , and we also watched our friends husky and boxer frequently when she went out of town for work . They looked great and were budget friendly ( super easy to put down ! ) As far as clean-up , there were a few times I just spilt a bucket of soapy water on the floors to get them clean after having 3 big dogs inside on them ! <p> Vinyl . Hands down . I had installed vinyl in our previous house bathroom , hall and office . It held up great , looked like real wood ( it was a textured vinyl ) and was not loud at all . Moved into our new house , which has laminate throughout and I hate it . Scratches easily , noisy as all get out , and is not textured so it looks like , well , laminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film covering it ) when I damp mop and I have to go over it with a special laminate " shiner " . A real pain in the patoot ! The vinyl looked great with just a damp mop . I am replacing the laminate ( and other flooring ) slowly with a groutable vinyl that looks like grey slate . I would never install laminate again ! <p> I 'd like to recommend the laminate option at Samsclub . You should check it out in person . The pictures on website do n't  do it any justice . We got the extra thickest one 14.3mm Canyon Oak that has best price than Lumber liquidator and HD , Lowes , etc . We installed it at our rental and my own house . I love it and my tenant loved it . Its for residential with commercial grade , we dragged furniture on it , spill water , dog , cat , kids , you name it , still no scratch at all and is a breeze to clean . Its also easily DIY by me n my hubby ( entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped vinyl plank flooring in our house about three years ago . Love it ! Its warm , shows no dirt , is n't loud like laminate and is industructible . We had trouble installing and would use the product again with professional installation . <p> We had Wilsonart laminate flooring installed in our kitchen , laundry room/mud room and powder room over 8 years ago and love it . It was n't cheap but is so much better than the horrible hard to clean builders vinyl flooring . We were told that water could damage Franklin Planner Trip Journa but its just hubby and I ( no pets ) and I wipe any water up right away . I love walking on it it is easy on the feet , no hollow sound at all ( an underpaid was installed ) . We chose a light gray color and it is so easy to clean just damp mop . No marks on the floors either after all these years . Dogs nails will make clicking sounds though when walking on it . No sounds when we walk on it . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look good you need to make sure you have a very level sub-floor before laying it otherwise you will get pockets that are springy and move , this not only makes the boards look cheap it can also produce a cracking / squeaking sound when there is excessive movement . <p> To fix an uneven floor there are various leveling compounds for concrete slabs that work well , but for timber floors there may be the need to plane , pack and sand in various areas which will take time and effort but will be worth it in the long run . <p> Another thing to consider is the scratching , once they are marked they are harder to repair than natural solid timber boards which can be sanded back and re sealed , stained or even painted . Yes natural timber boards are a hell of a lot more expensive but if laid correctly they will normally last longer than our time . <p> Hi ! I have n't read all your replies ( 83 so far ! ! ) so may be repeating , and you may be wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , but we chose laminate from Ikea ( were in the UK ) and are generally very pleased as it fulfilled our budget , looks good and thus far , about 3 years , has held up well . We laid it in our entrance hall , downstairs loo and a living room running off the hall . Were not big or particularly accomplished DIYers , but fitting was easy , except where at the edges narrow or short pieces had to be laid , which do n't  lock in to the rest very well as I presume there is n't enough grip . This is also a problem in the two doorways ; I had wanted a clean run through , but we 've had to add in threshold bars ( if you know what I mean ) , to stop the pieces coming apart . This is also generally a problem in the loo , being a very small room . I think the pieces lock together best when there are long , full width lengths . We may have been able to do it better a second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? ! What we chose is not waterproof and not recommended for wet areas but has been fine in our loo . Overall looks better than this suggests , does n't  show the dirt and easy to clean , so very pleased overall especially for the price . Jen <p> We have laminate in our living area and the Allure plank in our basement family room . While I truly love both looks . I would recommend the vinyl plank , just because of spills and leaks . Our laminate is deformed in a couple of areas due to even just simple spills that werent wiped right away and the Christmas tree leaked in one area and it is pretty warped . We also travel for weeks at a time during the summer and when we returned our pet sitter ( who lived in our house ) must have spilled something and not wiped it right away . Its right out in the open and you can see the raised part where the liquid was . <p> So for me the answer would have to be vinyl especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> We want to replace our carpet in our bedroom area at some point and I cant wait to pink vinyl also because I 'm hoping that it wont be as loud as the laminate ; ) when you walk on it . <p> We bought a house last summer and put MetroFlor Konecto Engage luxury vinyl planks in the entire house . Our house is waterfront and all second story living plus we have 2 large dogs . I needed something that can handle us living in our home : ) This brand was not the most expensive and if I am being totally honest , it was n't my favorite color BUT it has texture . There are many vinyls that are slippery just like laminate , even the hand scrapped . This vinyl had the most texture out of any sample we felt . Once they were installed I knew we made the right choice . I LOVE them . Easy to clean , durable , there is enough texture the dogs do n't  slip and slide all over and the floors are gorgeous . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck making a decision . I know for me it was one of the hardest to make during our remodel . <p> We also have newly installed plank vinyl throughout our beach house . I would like to use a vacuum to suction up the sand that gets tracked in , but the recommendation is to not use a vacuum with a hard bottom or a beater bar . Any that I 've found all have a hard bottom , although you can turn off the beater bar on some models . May I ask what you use ? <p> We can not use laminate flooring in our old house with wavy floors ( and we do n't  want to level for a variety of reasons ) , so we have installed vinyl planks in our high-traffic kitchen . The first time we went with the cheapest we could find , just to get flooring in during a whole house reno . Those wore well for about 5 years and were very sad for 2 more while we figured out what to replace them with . <p> After shopping around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinyl planks ( from Home Depot ) . We budgeted much more for flooring this go round , but love that this was very affordable . It is a floating floor system , similar to laminate planks , but flexible enough work well with our existing floor imperfections . We rented a heavy roller to seal the seams after installation . <p> The hair salon we patronize has the same flooring , and it is wearing well after years of extremely high traffic . We selected the Lisbon Cork pattern and have received oodles of compliments . Super easy to clean . We are going to install the same flooring in our mud room and laundry . <p> I 've had vinyl plank flooring in my home for 8 years now . I run a private home daycare and have a dog these floors are wonderful . I 'd never ever consider anything but vinyl plank flooring . When I move to my new place this spring I will remove all the laminate and replace it with vinyl . Most people I have over ( including Realtors ) cant tell the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my scrapbook room and laundry room . Allure Ultra is a floating floor that clicks together making it waterproof . We have had a leak in the laundry room and it held up great . In the scrapbook room we have a treadmill it has caused some dents but still looks great . I would use Allure Ultra in my whole house but I am afraid that for resale people will be turned off . I really want to get rid of all the carpet in my house so I am still undecided of what flooring would be the best for resale . Good luck with our decision . <p> Get rid of the carpet ! ! ! Its terrible . Most people are looking for houses with no carpet ! We just bought a house and have jerked it all up . When you list it for sale , just highlight the pros , no allergens , easy to clean , best for kids and pets , dancing etc ; ) you will have NO problem with selling it . In fact it will only make the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mannington installed everywhere in our house except the bedroom about 9 years ago . It still looks as good today as it did then ! We used an underlayment called " Whisper Step " that takes away the hollow sound you get when walking on laminate . <p> We have two rambunctious dogs who tear around the house , but other than the hair , youd never know it because their nails do NOT damage the laminate ! <p> One great thing about the laminate is that I can clean up all kinds of spills even nail polish , Sharpie and paint with nail polish remover without any damage ! <p> Wondering what type of driveway material you have leading to the garage ? If its asphalt , the light-colored vinyl may discolor over time . There will be residue on shoes that reacts with the chemical composition of vinyl . If an expert here can dispel that , feel free to correct me . I would vote for hardwood , but that 's just me ! <p> We looked at both last year . But we have big dogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile we did 1/16 grout line and the tile pattern is so random it looks like wood . It is even scraped . We did our entire downstairs of our house . Just another thought . <p> Given the choice between vinyl and laminate , I would go with vinyl . Hands down , without a doubt . <p> My mom had laminate in her studio/office , and the bathroom next door had a pipe break , sending water flooding into the studio . The laminate planks started to curl and warp almost instantly , and the floor was completely ruined . Plus , it has a hollow sound when you walk on it . <p> When she called the flooring place to have it replaced , the store owner suggested that she use vinyl instead . He said he sells more LVT these days than anything else because of its durability . Vinyl will withstand a flood , plus just about anything else you can throw at it , and come out looking just fine . I would n't necessarily recommend the Home Depot/Lowes stuff ( although I had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like hardwood , but the kind that actually looks like tile and it was incredibly durable ) , but instead I 'd spend the extra money and get a really good brand like Mannington . <p> We have a Mannington laminate that look much like your samples , I chose one with a yellow- green undertone , as it blended with the tile we kept in the home . We had it professionally installed over the tile in our home . It covers the entry , dining , library , den and breakfast room , about 2,000 sq ft . I love it ! 6 grand kids , an elderly mother with a walker , clean up is a breeze . I just clean with cleaner for laminate flooring . Everyone that comes into my home thinks it is wood flooring . <p> Wow , you have alot of feedback already , but I just had to add my 2 cents . We installed wood plank looking ( its all in one sheet , not seperate blocks ) vinyl about 10 years ago in our kitchen dining room . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am still in love with it . If it was n't , oh what would you say " a decorating sin " I would run it throughout my living room too . I was just thinking this morning if we build a home , I may put it in the whole house because It will be my house then til I die . It has held up wonderful , not hard to clean , just mop with rag mop or hands and knees . Never really looks dirty . Everyone thinks its hardwood , since it is textured . In fact I would bet a realitor would come in and list it as hard wood just by looking without being told different ! ; ) ! Its awesome , I do n't  care for the smooth shinny look of laminate myself . <p> I do not recommend laminate planks in wet areas . We had laminate throughout our last house , and the water in the kitchen caused it to bow up . Also , the feel is very plastic-y and hard . At least vinyl would be soft . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . The vinyl was super waterproof and durable , but if it did get scuffed ( by sliding a heavy piece of furniture instead of lifting , for example ) it was challenging to camouflage ( Although , maybe it was just the product we chose ) . Also , if there was anything beneath the vinyl flooring ( even small items like crumbs of drywall that were accidentally missed ) or any unevenness in the flooring beneath it when it was laid , the vinyl eventually melded to those areas and looked slightly wavy if you looked at it from the right direction . The laminate was tough as nails . Ours NEVER scratched and we had a 60 lb , heavy-footed pit bull at the time who was constantly sliding all over the floor with his nails . My only complaint was that if liquid was allowed to sit on a seam for a while ( like once when our dog got sick while we were at work ) , it did warp the board in that area . I personally felt like the laminate looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  shape to the imperfections in the floor beneath it . Anyways , that 's just my take ! Good luck ! I 'm sure whatever you choose will be fantastic ! : ) <p> I think that Vinyl is the way to go in terms of longevity and with the options they have now you cant even tell that its vinyl and not laminate . My favourite of the 3 vinyl options that you have is the one on the right , I think it looks the most like a real hardwood because of the graining and the width I love the look of a wider plank ! ! ! <p> I have recently seen tile that looks like weathered wood plank flooring . If i was half the DIYer that you are I would so tackle that project in my house . It truly loks like wood flooring but is tile . I did n't  look into it to determine the cost , but when I 'm ready it will certainly be something I will consider . I love your blog and admire your talents . <p> Let me add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five years ago , we too installed the wood look everywhere but the bathrooms , where we put in the tile look Adura . Looks real . Wears like iron . Water is not an issue . No noise . Easy to replace a plank ( though we have never had to ! ) Steam mops beautifully . <p> I 've had similar experiences to Shari . While I wo n't say I hate my laminate , I definitely would n't recommend it . Its a good brand ( maybe Armstrong ? ) , but any amount of moisture will cause the seems to swell- a spill that you do n't  wipe up within 30 mins , the steam from the dishwasher , a damp towel or shoes that get left on the floor . It also shows foot prints and is super slippery . Our dog is actually afraid of the floor because its like shes ice skating . It is difficult to scratch or mar it , but it does happen occaisionally . I 'm able to cover scratches with a brown marker and they 're not very noticeable , but overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also highly recommend Allure by Trafficmaster at Home Depot . It is basically rubber flooring but it looks beautiful ! We installed in a home on the water in Florida super easy and wears very well ! Saw it for the first time in their river house it was the weathered wood you like and I was SHOCKED that it was rubber ! And because its water proof/resistant no challenges for being on the water ! Only downside is that it will fade in the areas that get a lot of sun but if you have some extra , its easy to change out ! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product ! Its not cheap but so worth it , and so easy to install yourself ! And so many options wood , tile , etc beautiful ! <p> We have vinyl plank flooring . I love the color and look , it is extremely durable and waterproof is a plus , but it is extremely hard to keep clean . It seems like its hard to get dirtiness out of the grooves ( texture ) . It also shows greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I would much rather have a engineered hardwood or laminate that looks like hand scraped wood . I LOVE the grey look ! I would love to know where these samples are from and color names ? ? Especially the top row second from left ! Good luck ! <p> We went with a high-grade commercial laminate flooring from Armstrong . It is AMAZING ! We wanted ( engineered ) hardwood in a smokey grey/brown color ( very modern ) , but those shades in natural wood are super expensive ! Our laminate was incredibly expensive for laminate , but it was still cheaper than the engineered wood in a similar shade . <p> We have had no problems whatsoever with it ! We have it installed all downstairs ( including powder room and kitchen ) . It holds up to scratches and water really well ( havent experienced swelling yet ) , and its very easy to clean . A swiffer does the trick ! I would say none of our guests can tell it is " fake " because the print and solid feel of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely better than regular laminate , though , as I have other family who have opted for less expensive laminate and its not quite as nice as ours . Oh , and did I mention were still in the middle of remodelling our house , which means tools and everything get placed on this floor . So far so good ! <p> We did check out vinyl planks , but we did n't  like the texture as much ; it feels a tad rubbery under the feet or a bit " crisp " like walking on plastic . <p> I hope that helps ! I definitely recommend checking out the Armstrong line . We searched high and low ( we live in the Bay Area ) but looked even as far as Southern California . We considered tile as well . : ) <p> We have n't used the vinyl , but have installed the laminate . Ours had the backing attached . We thought it would make a difference so we would n't hear the hollow sound . Wrong ! That 's the only part I hate admittedly . <p> Laminate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak for 8 years or so . Hallway , Kitchen , dining and living room . We even did the closets ! Two big dogs screeching around on it and there only two little dings ( which you cant even see because we used the Pergo filler ) from rocks stuck in shoe treads . Do n't  wash with water we use Murphys laminate floor cleaner . It looks as nice as when it was put it . Only tips measure like mad and then measure again you need to plan to make sure you end up with the correct width plank at the end of the room . Leveling is important too you should check your floor and use a leveler that they recommend it looks something like spackle . My husband and I , and we are are not handy at all , put it in ourselves over several weekends . AND upgrade the underlayment it makes a big difference in sound . <p> I installed the vinyl ALL OVER my house I even removed tile and carpet to do so . My folks had a bad experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something dog/child proof . It is ! And if a single plank becomes spoiled , it can be replaced easily . My only gripe about the flooring and this would happen with any solid surface is the dust . You will be totally grossed out by how much dust and hair was hidden by your carpet . <p> I put Wilsonart laminate in two of my kids rooms 14 years ago . . . . and it still looks great ! Unfortunately the Wilsonart plants here in the USA have shut down and I was unable to get more of the product : - ( So I am in the thinking stages as well for the last bedroom . <p> You might want to look into Marmoleum. . . it is an all natural product made in the USA . I just did 3 bedrooms and a living in my daughters condo. . .. and she loves it . It did require professional installation though . . . not for the DYI people ! <p> When we moved into our new home here in the UK , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire downstairs . We chose a light french oak colour and it has been brilliant , cleans fantastically , we can replace the planks if needed ( havent had to yet ) and other than putting felt pads on the bottom of heavy pieces of furniture to stop scratches when I move furniture around ( which I do a lot ! ) , we have n't had to look after it in any special way . We have a 1 and 3 year old so the floor has been used and abused and still looks like new , looks and feels like wood under foot as well . I even dropped my Le creuset pan on it and not even a mark : - ) Ca n't fault it . <p> I first installed Home Depots Allure Vinyl plank in my living room 4 years ago . I foster rescue dogs , so was looking for something that was extremely durable and pee-proof . I LOVE this flooring ! It is quiet to walk on , does n't  get too cold in the winter , is extremely durable ( withstands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pee-proof ! Every one that 's seen it , thinks it is real wood . It is more dimensional/textured that laminate . Ive been so satisfied that the following year , I installed it in my kitchen . I did this design with a " custom " inlay of vinyl tile . Then , the following year , installed it in my master bedroom and on suite bathroom . <p> I did all of the installation completely alone ! It is super easy . All you need is a utility knife , measuring tool , and a roofers square or angle . <p> I have the laminate wood like flooring that looks rustic and has the " hand scraped " feel in our guest unit , and I love it ! We replaced all the floors in our main house with engineered wood but now wish I had gone with laminate instead . It would have saved me tons of money and I would n't have to stress about getting scratches so easily on my floor . The laminate seems very durable and has kept well even with two little dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Score ! And I only paid $1.39 a square foot ( a Home Depot special ) . Either way I do n't  think you can go wrong . But feel to me is important as look . And its nice not to have to worry about floors . We are remodeling our entire house and so cost is very important . By the way I love your blog ! ! ! <p> This past spring my husband and I had the Luxury Vinyl Planks installed . We did a remodel of our split level home , where we opened up the living room , kitchen and dining area making it all open using the vinyl plank flooring throughoutwe LOVE IT ! We have a 75 lbs lab and it wears wonderful . We were advised to have it all glued down because of the kitchen area and you never know if and when you may have any water issues . Laminate will buckle and bubble with water . The brand we went with is Karndean in Hickory . Ironically , today I picked up a vinyl tile by Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I plan on doing this flooring myself , gluing down and groutingI cant wait . Again , we Love our Luxury Vinyl flooring and I do n't  think you will be unhappy with the results . <p> We 've had top of the line Armstrong laminate and finally replaced it with vinyl plank . No more worrying about moisture damage from the dogsno more mop marks from whenever floor was washed or spot cleaned .. vinyl is softer , warmer and more realistic lookingpeople thought we put real hardwood down in place of the laminate <p> We installed the vinyl and love it . Its one where it has a sticky tab . They have texture and a wide variety of colors to choose from . Looks new again when cleaned with mop and glow . We have 2 large dogs and the vinyl is super durable . <p> When we moved into our house only the bedrooms had carpet . It was really old and gross so we immediately had it replaced with laminate . Its been just over 6 years and we 've never had any problems . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the floor and a dog . The floors look exactly the same . I cant say how theyd hold up in wet areas but I know ours have had spills that went unnoticed for awhile and theyve always cleaned right up . <p> I too have done a lot of thinking and research on this subject . I like the vinyl more than the laminate . The Traffic Master Allure Ultra is the one with the tongue and groove install , not the sticky strips . My sister put a weathered gray plank of this brand in a loft area and is happy with the choice . I also like the Karndean Loose Lay product . Other companies have a products like this . This is a 100% recyclable vinyl product that is thick enough to just lay on the floor . If there is a gouge , or another problem , the plank can be replaced . If you have a water problem , you can pick up the tile and dry out the area , and put the tiles back down . My sister this put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installers used a low tack adhesive here and there . They used a calking gun and made " s " patterns on the floor . Supposedly you can still pick up a tile if there is a problem . You can get free samples from Karndean . It is more expensive than the Allure product . I have not figured out how to get it at a discount ! I also know someone that used a Karndean product glued down on the basement floor and she is happy with it . Karndean has lots of information on the site . I think the biggest problem with laminate is that water can ruin it . I have read that Luxury Vinyl Tile plank is the best selling floor product now . In fact Armstrong is building a new plant in Lancaster County , PA to keep up with the demand . <p> I have been selling floor covering for the last 9 years or so . I personally prefer a vinyl plank over laminate for the following reasons : * its completely waterproof . If snow melts into a puddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor and does n't  pick them up ; no worries . Even the best laminate floors have the same weakness : moisture can and will eventually destroy them . *you can clean vinyl plank with a wet mop or steamer . Laminates must be cleaned like a hardwood ( very little moisture no mop and bucket ! ) *Vinyl plank does n't  have that tell-tale feel and " hollow " sound of a laminate floor . *You can actually touch up a vinyl plank with the same products you would use on laminate or hardwood ( touch up pen , wax stick , etc . ) <p> I have nothing against laminate . It has its uses . I always give my customers the pros and cons of each , and then let them decide what 's best for their family or situation . <p> As far as the look , texture , and how well it hides or shows smudges , dirt and footprints , that has more to do with the style of the floor than whether its vinyl or laminate . Anything with very little pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  matter what its made out of ( tile , wood , laminate , vinyl ) . The same goes for how well it will wearany hard surface floor can be damaged by heavy items being dragged across them , chair legs without the proper protectors , plastic office chair wheels , etc . I have seen the glazing on ceramic tile destroyed because people did n't  put felt pads on their metal dining room chair legs . Common sense , people ! <p> With both products , you kinda get what you pay for . Look for a product with a light commercial warranty . If a company is offering a " lifetime " residential warranty , but no commercial warranty , be wary . Any company can slap a warranty on a product , the question is how will they handle it if you have a claim ? ? Like any other purchase , do n't  believe everything you read , and do your due diligence . <p> We are doing some remodeling and I am about ready to put Manningtons Adura Plank in my entire upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the downstairs , and it will be vinyl plank or luxury vinyl tile throughout those rooms , too . Keep in mind that I work in this industry . I know what 's out there , AND I have access to all of it with deep discounts , AND I could get anything I want professionally installed by my boss for cheap . I could do hardwood , or ceramic tile , or whatever . But I choose vinyl . It just makes sense for how we live . <p> We put vinyl planks in our basement . When my husband said " How about vinyl for the basement ? " I stuck up my nose and I 'm pretty sure I said " ew " ha ! But then he showed it to me and I loved it ! I looks fantastic and is super durable . here 's a link to my basement to see the floor : LONG ... <p> just remember , you always get what you pay for . We bought good looking laminate flooring on sale at Lowes and it was a nightmare to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pieces . Tooks days and days to get it all in and now that were living on it , some of the planks are separating and we 've actually had to nail them in place . We would never buy laminate again . We got what we paid for ( unfortunately ) . <p> what about air quality concerns ? my personal goal is to avoid any and all vinyl in our house ( flooring , shower curtains , toys , etc ) because vinyl off-gasses and has toxic chemicals in it . not sure how that compares to what is in laminate , but i 'd be inclined to avoid vinyl for that reason alone . <p> We 've had both products in our home and I agree with Jill as far as you get what you pay for . Our laminate was here when we moved in . I cant say I like it much . Besides it being cheaper quality and the finish wearing off in high traffic areas , it has a colder feel and is much louder than our vinyl and I definitely agree with it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the one downside is that if there is anything really heavy being moved you have to lift it or it will rip the vinyl very easily . We got a hole in ours when we moved in our washing machine and dryer and I 'm always worried about it when I move the fridge to clean behind it . I also agree with the person who said an uneven floor shows through with vinyl . Make sure any quirks in the floor are worked out before its laid . <p> I think they 're vinyl roll goods ! and were chosen for their authentic look and great wearing properties . You can imagine what they 're put through with all the filming equipment and people that are n't  worrying about the floors ! Take a look ; it might be another option . P.S. I think I may have originally gotten this link from you on your BOB or weekend reading or interesting reads posts . <p> I 've had engineered wood floors and laminate . Loved our laminate wide plank floors we put down in our last house . When we moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-3 small imperfections that I could find because I knew where they were and I still had to look for them . ( Not the case with carpet or the last wood floor I 'd had . ) We did n't  put it in a kitchen or bath . In my new house I have cheapo laminate in the kitchen . It is holding up pretty well , but its days are numbered <p> We put laminate flooring throughout our house , including the stairs . There is no wall-to-wall carpet anywhere . Its 10 years old and looks new even after 10 yrs of my own and various other visitor dogs living and playing on it . Cleaning is with a water-dampened microfiber cloth mop . I tried the cleaners made for laminate flooring but did n't  like the residue . I went back to plain water or a mixture of white vinegar/water/ammonia ( no rinsing/no residue ) . One can not use the steam cleaners on laminate . ( Obviouslyglue and steam just do n't  like each other . ) One tip if you are still considering laminate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining , costs almost as much as the laminate , but provides a softer feel under foot and eliminates any slight echoing . The vinyl planks look really good , and I love the waterproof feature . That would be a hard choice . <p> When I bought this house over 10 years ago I bought an oak floor for the living room and vinyl for the kitchen . They looked very identical so people thought I had a wooden floor in the kitchen . Over the years the wood changed colors ( a natural proces ) but the vinyl did n't  . It is very easy to clean and in my opinion it still looks the same . The concrete floor in the kitchen was n't that great before the vinyl was laid , but the wood look/texture conceals most of it . As I live in the Netherlands I cant answer any of the other questions ! Good luck with your choice ! <p> We live in military housing and have had both floor types . Were currently living with a vinyl version of " wood . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminate we had in the past . It has nice texture and the grain is very realistic ( people even get psyched out at first thinking its real ! ) . The two negatives , in my opinion , is that it can be tough to clean if something sticky dries down in the textured grooves . That 's only happened a couple times , but it requires hand and knees scrubbing . The other minus is that really heavy furniture can dent or dimple the vinyl . The previous tenants must have had something heavy ( or they were when they sat on their couch ) because there are indentations in the flooring where the couch sits . We have n't had that happen with any of our furniture , though . The negatives of the laminate we had ( 2 different kinds ) was one did n't  have any texture and seemed shiny and slick . Any dust was SO obvious ! The other , that had some texture was better , but still slick and both were MUCH louder than the vinyl . But , I like either product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military housing . And either are heads and tails above carpet when you 're renting ! <p> I 've had click-lock laminate for a little over 3 years now in the house ( after deciding against engineered and full hardwoods ) . I still love them as much as I did when I first installed them . Simply gorgeous . I have them in the kitchen , half bath , and all throughout the main floor . Pro : they still look new , despite all of the foot traffic , accidentally dropping things ( like a hammer ) , and the dogs claws . Con : they can not ever have standing water on top . I 've used a steam cleaner on them before and it worked well ( but the steamer was only meant to briefly wet down the surface &amp; immediately evaporate ) . There was a spill in the half bath that warped one of the boards and a similar warping on part of a seam in the hallway where the dog got sick during the night . That 's honestly my only complaint , which is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know that I would have gone with vinyl , though . I 've just never liked the patterns on them ( they always look more fake to me ) and I 've lived in a house with tiny imperfections underfoot from something underneath the flooring . It just bugs me . But , with products changing all the time , I guess I can never say never ! <p> I had Bruce engineered wood floor and I liked it very much , lots of teenagers around , 3 dogs , numerous cats , wood fireplace and always seemed to drop a log right on the floor starting a new fire and I thought it looked beautiful . In my last house here in the PNW , it was just me and my husband around , a 45lb dog and a 12lb dog . I had Armstrong 12mm ( NO clickiness at all ) laminate professionally installed . It did not hold up well . I was shocked at how easily it scratched and chipped on the edges . It looked great , the home appraiser and realtors thought it was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a residue , so I used water mostly . There was a mystery leak by the fireplace 3 times , the area swelled but it went down completely like brandnew . I do n't  know why it scratched so easily and I do n't  mean around the dining room chairs , just random areas . A friend in Ohio ( snowy area ) had Pergo on her kitchen and had 5 children . The floor was obviously not real wood but it always looked great to me . I do n't  know what was wrong with this Armstrong floor . <p> When I moved to a larger apartment within the same community , I asked the leasing agent if they would consider installing laminate flooring instead of replacing the cheap apartment grade carpeting with more of the same . I offered to pay the difference in cost for a hard flooring option over carpeting . Because the new apartment is on the first floor , they finally agreed . Except they wanted to use vinyl plank flooring instead . Ive been in this unit for two years and still love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Worth it to pay money to improve someone elses property ? Heck , yeah ! <p> It was such a chore to try to keep carpet clean with a dog . My vinyl plank floor is a dream to clean . I alternately vacuum or dust mop to keep up with the dog hair . Should the dog have an accident , I do n't  have to freak out . A wipe and a squirt of cleaner is all it takes ! Occasionally , I break out the steam mop or Swiffer . <p> Apparently , I started a trend . Yeah , that 's me . A trend setter . two other resident stopped by for a look . After having seem how nice the floor is , they had the same installed in their units ! <p> The home we are in came with laminate flooring in the kitchen and guest bath . Our home is less than two years old . At a glance this floor looks great but it should have never been put in a kitchen or traffic area . A single drop of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if left for any length of time . If you drop a fork or something sharp , it leaves a mark . I have had other laminate flooring in an office that was easily worn down by an office chair . I would recommend checking out the tile flooring that looks like wood planks . I have always loved how well a tile floor holds up to just about anything . It is also a DIY project that I have done several times . It takes more work to install but is cost effective if you do it yourself . It holds up so much better than laminate . <p> I have laminate in most of my house and would not put it in a kitchen again . I 'm saving up to replace it because its warped in a few spots . It really wont hold up to moisture/spills over the long run . I 'm seriously considering vinyl plank for my bedroom as well , so that I can run it straight into the ensuite without worries about water . I would n't even consider doing that with laminate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with two active kids and a dog . Plus , we also get a lot of compliments on them and people are so surprised when we tell them its laminate . It cleans up really well too ! <p> We have laminate flooring though our kitchen , dining , mudroom areas . We 've had it for four years . Its a higher quality laminate so the look is nice . <p> The downside is that it is water sensitive . If the cats spill water and we do n't  catch it right away , the flooring soaks it up like a sponge and then it causes ripples . When we talked with the floor guy we had out after a dishwasher episode , he informed us that the product is a lot like cardboard . Ugh . <p> The advantage is that there are n't  gaps in the boards like there are in our friends houses with real wood and it does resist scratching , scraping , and scuffs wonderfully . You can not tell the area is high traffic . <p> You may have already decided on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , love our laminate flooring . We live hard in this house we had our two boys with all of their friends hanging out until they left for college plus two large dogs plus a husband who thinks nothing of working out in the garden in mud and walking in the house with his shoes on . You get the picture . We 've had laminate flooring in our living areas for 15 years and there are a few small chips that are hardly noticeable but other than that the floors look great . So good , in fact , we replaced our bedroom floor with laminate too . On the other hand , the wood floor in the hall is scratched and dented and looks horrible . I remember 25 years ago in our previous house we installed wood flooring in our family room and as soon it was ready to walk on our 125 pound bernese mountain dog ran in , slid across the room , then dug his claws into the floor resulting in long , deep gouges . Oh well , houses are for living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new build . I wanted something that required little maintenance , would stand up to high traffic and water-prone areas like the entry and kitchen , and that looked awesome ! Vinyl was the way to go ! <p> I 've LOVED it ( so easy to clean ) and it withstands all that two young kids can throw at it ! Everyone who visits comments on our nice wood floors ; even a contractor came over after some inspections and thought it was " real " ! We thought wed start with vinyl and eventually upgrade to hardwood , but were loving the vinyl floors so much I think were sticking with it ! <p> The weathered plank look option is always a good one , the reason I say this is because over time the floor will gradually become worn out , with the weathered look flooring , the worn down effect is already there , so it wo n't seem as if the floor getting even more worn down . <p> I know this was posted over a month ago , but I wondered if you had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you decide to get laminate floor in the kitchen or bathroom , where water will be present , as long as the flooring is fitted correctly ( best to get a professional to do it ) you will not have a problem with water . The water will just sit on the floor and wait to be cleaned up . <p> I never even considered vinyl until I read this post . Ive been wanting to remove the carpet from my sewing/craft room for 5+ years , but could never make a decision on what floor to go with it . After reading all the comments , I went w/vinyl planks and bought it ASAP before I could change my mind ! My husband and I installed it this past weekend I am still sore . I think it looks good , but only time will tell in regards to how well it holds up . This was our first floor and it was fairly easy . The planks snapped together no glue or adhesive . I 'm looking forward to seeing what floor you ended up with . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after water leak I begin to research new flooring options that can withstand 2 dogs . I really love Modin LVT flooring at Flooret.com. if you reasearch there wear layer its the best out there ( 40mil ) . Havent found anything to compare yet to price and product . Research the wear layer its sooooo important . <p> I personally am not a fan of vinyl . I know it has changed over the years , but I found where it is really hard to clean . Such as in kitchen and bathrooms . Hairsprays in bathrooms , grease from kitchens all that seems to settle in the vinyl and it is really hard to get out . I 'm more a tile person kitchen , bathrooms and entry ways . After I removed all the vinyl from my house and replace it with tile I will never ever go back to vinyl. 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057663 @3257663/ <h> Kitchen Remodel : 10 Lessons <p> By Kate Riley September 3 , 2015 <p> We bought this fixer house as an investment because its what we love to do , take old dated spaces and modernize them . We chose Vegas because I have a ton of family there including my parents who live down the street- and you can buy a fixer upper home for a decent price- unlike real estate in the Bay Area where everything is $500+ a square foot , housing prices are crazy ridiculous here . <p> Fixer uppers do n't  scare me , in fact the uglier the better I say . ( Just today we wrote up an offer- to purchase- a home down the street in even worse condition than this one and I cant wait to get my hands on it , more to come . ) So when we walked through this homes kitchen- this was the first impression . <p> I 'm not judging the mess , the sellers were in the process of moving out so it was a disaster zone- and- everything dated- back to 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I liked everything about this house when we bought it except the kitchen . The layout was not my favorite and I cringed when I first saw it . I prefer the classic L shape , U shape , or galley kitchen , and always with a window. - This one had an awkward angled peninsula with a raised counter I found bizarre- but I welcomed the challenge and knew it could be so good with a remodel . <p> Lesson #1 : Any kitchen can be beautiful with vision and quality materials . <p> - <p> See this post for the full kitchen tour . This kitchen remodel- includes Shaker style cabinets and quartz countertops , also white appliances since they 're clean looking , complement the white cabinetry , also wont scratch as easily with renters living in the home . The hardware is polished chrome , the floors are porcelain wood plank tile ( see all sources below . ) <p> #2 : Prepare Yourself for Inconvenience . <p> For several months the kitchen had only cabinets and a refrigerator , no sink , no oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat all our stuff on which I cleaned off solely to take this picture . <p> We ordered a lot of takeout . We ate a lot of raw food . We stored dry goods on a fold out table . We- hit up Mom and Dad down the street for hot meals . With any major kitchen renovation prepare yourself for weeks if not months of having no appliances you can do it youll just have to get creative . Use your BBQ . Buy a toaster oven , etc . Lots of people I know set up makeshift kitchens elsewhere in the garage to get through the process . <p> #3 : Always Over Budget by 15-20% <p> We had a specific budget with this kitchen , it included the- savings for partnering with Cliq Studios for discounted cabinets and- buying a- used refrigerator , I splurged elsewhere ( see #7- below ) . Know there are things that will happen- along the way will be unexpected and cost money to fix . <p> Example : - by working with- semi-custom cabinets in fixed widths , once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the- right of the cabinets where the old pantry used to be on an angled wall . Despite the precise measurements I sent to my kitchen cabinet designer , this was a complication . <p> The arched- entry to the kitchen on the other side- next to- the refrigerator is- thicker so I hired the same- sub who retextured the walls smooth to reframe the- wall and make the wall meet the lower cabinet to solve the problem . <p> Reframing it resulted in- additional labor costs- and also required paying for patching the tile floor that we cut into by widening the wall and recessing it- a few inches . However the result was a a clean edge that met the cabinets so I did n't  have to add side trim and now it looks more like- a custom fit . <p> - #4 : Know When to Hire Professionals . <p> Were not afraid to DIY but when it comes to big jobs like cabinet installation we hired a professional finish carpenter to do it for us since precision was key , read about the installation here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but- paid the extra money to guarantee a perfect fit- by a finish carpenter . This space we learned had the wonkiest uneven floors and walls , and a professional made sure with shims and precise measurements all the cabinets were flush and level . <p> We also hired professionals to install the hood liner and the tile backsplash , we 've done a lot of tile backsplashes in our lives but since he was on site to- cut and install tile in the master bathroom , we paid- to have him- do the same in- the kitchen too . <p> Note the awkwardness of the venting situation above . When we ripped into the kitchen soffit and had to rebuild it ( see #3- above on over budgeting for unexpected things ) we discovered a main water- pipe ran right through that space directly- above the range . Because I had made the- cabinets on the left- of the range 6 inches wider now my hood liner was forced to move over- 6 inches too- so we had to install an elbow in the ceiling and use flexible ducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood liner hides it but this was another unexpected situation where we turned to- professional help . <p> But then there were all the little things that we opted to do ourselves , like buying glass from a local merchant and- securing it with silicone on our own , also installing light fixtures and hardware , etc . <p> - <p> #5. - Have a Lighting Plan . <p> Older kitchens often do n't  have multiple sources for light like modern ones . This kitchen in its original state had only one box florescent as a source of light . I replaced them with recessed incandescent lights on dimmers- and also added three pendants over the peninsula , also on dimmers for varied sources of light . ( In our California kitchen remodel from many years ago which is a larger space , I also added under cabinet lighting , a separate light over the sink , and lights inside the glass cabinets , also worthy of consideration ! ) <p> Design wise , there 's no rule that light fixtures should match , but I believe they should complement each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both the pendants and the breakfast nook chandelier since they 're adjacent to each other . <p> #6 . Make Functional Changes . <p> We could n't move any plumbing because of the slab foundation so we kept the appliances and- sink in the same place , but I do think one of my smarter- changes was moving the pantry into the adjacent- breakfast nook for more storage and more counter space in the kitchen . One regret is not insisting the tops and trim go to the ceiling but hey if Sarahs cabinets stop short then so can mine ! <p> I- found these chairs and that table on separate thrift store visits . The table I painted and moved to the sunroom , the chairs I spray painted gloss white then recovered their seats in a Tarjay- shower curtain- seen here . <p> - <p> Several of you asked about the rationale of moving the microwave out of the kitchen . I 'm not a big microwave user but many of you are ( great debate in these comments ) so I planned ahead and made room for one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it out in the garage- and may move it to this bakers rack- but I did make sure there was room for one outside of the kitchen . <p> Another functional change was opting for a counter depth fridge instead of the standard depth that was there before , now it doesnt- protrude into the- kitchen entrance like the old one did and- its framed in- for a more custom look . <p> Lesson #7 : Decide Where to Splurge and Where to Save . <p> I saved money with discounted cabinets , but spent extra on a custom hood ( see #8 below ) . I bought a used counter depth refrigerator and cheaper model dishwasher- but paid more for a slide in range instead of a free standing one because its lower profile allowed the tile to take the spotlight . <p> I bought inexpensive hardware but paid more than Ive ever paid per square foot for the backsplash tile . I bought a floor model breakfast table for 25% off- because it had a few scratches and recovered thrift store chairs to save money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Decide early on where you can save money and where you do n't  intend to compromise , you can have a beautiful space by combining the inexpensive options with a few splurge worthy choices . <p> #8 . Communicate Clearly with Contractors . <p> Sometimes things do n't  work out as well as you plan due to lack of communication . I did n't  want a hood cabinet- in this kitchen I- wanted a custom chimney hood and- thought it would be easy to just have a carpenter build it so I- sent him this image as an example of what I wanted . <p> By the time it was- installed I learned the carpenter had n't  used as high quality wood- as I thought he should and he also improvised with different trim . I had n't  put it the details- in writing , only texted the image of the design which was- really dumb on my part and so- the design while functional- did n't  look exactly- like- I wanted . Rather than start over , I had- him come back and beef up the trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks fine in the space , I 'm just being picky , after all the trim on range hood covers does n't  need to be exactly the same as the neighboring upper cabinets and does make the space more interesting but still , the result was not precisely what I wanted . If I 'd have drawn out the specifications and communicated them clearly , the- result would have been different . <p> #9 . Details Matter . <p> In every kitchen remodel Ive learned- the devil is in the details . here 's an example . This is the- edge of the peninsula in the beginning , I knew I wanted to take it down to one level surface . What I later did n't  like was how the cabinet edge looked next to the wall . <p> Lowering the pony wall from bar height to counter height was a huge improvement but I still found the difference in color between the wall and cabinet jarring from this angle . <p> - <p> I toyed with the idea of a waterfall edge- ( see this post ) but did n't  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it would look unbalanced from this view to have a waterfall edge only on the right side . A waterfall edge , while dreamy , did n't  quite work for this space . <p> The solution was to disguise the side of the cabinet with drywall for a clean smooth- edge , its a little detail but it- makes a big difference . <p> #10 . Personalize With What You Love . <p> Sure its important with kitchen remodels- to make timeless choices with cabinets and countertops that will still look great in 20 years . But I also believe when- you 're remodeling for YOU that you should n't always play it safe and have a little fun like I did with- my- diva tile backsplash . <p> When I spied the Tessera blend in the Kaleidoscope pattern in the tile showroom I could n't get it out of my head so I paid more money for it than I ever have on a backsplash- even with a designer discount ( thank you Oceanside ) and ordered it . <p> This particular- tile must be installed with the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I installed a tile mirror border with the same brand of tile . ) This particular- hand cut mosaic required I wait 2 hours for the mortar to be almost-but-not-quite dry then soak the paper with a sponge , slowly peel it back and readjust each and every single triangle for even grout lines . It took me over two hours just to peel off the paper and reposition the tiles but it was- worth it . <p> - <p> I also mixed- a custom- grout color , half Platinum half Bright White , the result was a paler gray . <p> Not everyone- adores- this backsplash as much as I do but what matters is that I LOVE IT . <p> Several of you asked for a paint color match for the cabinets , the white I color matched to Sherwin Williams Alabaster and used it to paint the custom hood . The lower cabinets are gray with a hint of blue , the closest is- Benjamin Moores Marina Gray which I used to paint the inside of the glass upper kitchen cabinets . <p> Wonderful remodel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen too ! ! Thanks for the tips ! One sourcing question . In the photo with your backsplash selection ( georgous , by the way ! ! ) , there are also a few more selections . The multicolored hex is the one I 'm referring to . Is that Oceanside glass too ? ? ? Thanks so much ! Bravo : ) <p> I absolutely adore the tile . The problem now is I might have my heart set on it and its is probably out of my budget . It is so different then the now standard " mixed bars " or simple , timeless , possibly boring subway . <p> This is so BEAUTIFUL ! The backsplash is gorgeous . I learned I really do n't  like stainless steel but since the most desirable stove only came in stainless steel , I felt the other appliances should also . However , next time , which will be soon , they just wont match , stainless steel stove and white everything else . Is that bad ? I also found a counter depth frig looked best for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet but it does n't  sink in . Its just my husband and me , but if I still had kids at home , I would be plenty upset . The best option would have been to move the refrigerator . Live and learn . <p> So pretty ! Maybe you covered this elsewhere , but what are your thoughts on the white appliances ? We are building a new home and will have white cabinets with a white/gray countertop and a gray or stained island . White appliance are obviously less expensive in fact they are the " standard " allowance we get from our builder . But my family wants stainless or slate . They think it looks better or more finished , that the white would look cheap . Thoughts on the stainless/slate trend ? ? ? <p> I 'm a long time reader . I love your style , Kate . The Vegas house turned out beautifully ! I was wondering , since I believe you 've mentioned that your husband is a broker ( ? ) , if you could/would do a post about determining how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still make a profit when it comes time to sell ? <p> I recently had a kitchen remodel also . One thing I learned is contractors do not have the eye or vision of the homeowner therefore very close supervis+on is important . And if not satisfied , have them fix it until you are happy . On the other hand , it is also important that the contractor advises the homeowner if the design will not work beforehand so that adjustments can be made early on . Yours turned out beautiful . And I am happy with mine . <p> Gorgeous remodel . I too went with a slide in range so my tile back-splash would not be disrupted . I wish I had gone with a power strip under the cabinets , so there would n't be outlets in the back-splash . I do n't  see any in yours.are they hidden behind decorative items for the pictures ? Also regarding #3 , would n't it have been cheaper/easier/faster to divide the extra space at the end of the cabinet run between all the cabinets ( 4 ? ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ? It would have barely been noticeable . Glad you nixed the waterfall ideasometimes the easiest solutions are the best . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057666 @3257666/ <h> Sunset Idea House Tour + Takeaways <p> By Kate Riley August 18 , 2016 <p> I was invited to attend a preview of the Sunset Magazine Idea House here in the Bay Area . The home is multilevel on a dramatic slope that takes in views of the Bay and is decorated with a combination of modern and transitional furnishings . The entire home was light and bright with an organic feel due to the wood floors , textural accents , and abundance of green plants . The designer on this project was Lauren Geremia and there were a lot of great takeaways that caught my eye . <p> 1 . Yes you can wallpaper the kitchen . This was such a beautiful detail and brilliant idea , the use of the William Morris bird &amp; pomegranate wallpaper behind glass as a backsplash . I love this idea because the paper adds beautiful pattern but is protected from moisture or grease by the glass . <p> - <p> - <p> 2 . Create a larger chandelier with smaller pendants . This was another ingenious installation in the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row to create a larger chandelier effect . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 3 . Layer smaller rugs on larger ones . Throughout the home the designer chose large scale neutral rugs and layered them with smaller rugs on top to add pattern and interest . If you have a rug you 'd love to use in a room , say a vintage Kilim , but it 's too small for a space , consider buying a larger rug that fits and layering the smaller on top . It works ! ( Depicted below are the guest room , master bedroom , and office . ) <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 4 . Opt for warm neutrals instead of cool . I loved that the sofa and some of the other furnishings in this home were a soft buttery yellow instead of the gray we see so much of . It was a warmer and equally as lovely choice , one that picked up on the dry grasses that exist on the slopes of this Northern California landscape . <p> - <p> 5 . Use plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every room had a potted plant or tree growing near the light , helping to blur the transition between indoors and out . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Use a large and wide container to create a living centerpiece , it will last longer than flowers ! <p> - <p> Each of the multiple decks that looked out the the view had planters in beautiful modern containers which added necessary greenery to a home that does n't have a rear yard due to the sloped lot . <p> - <p> - <p> Here are a few other takeaways , never fear dark walls in small spaces ! In this bathroom the designer used Cosmos by Sarkos wallpaper to create drama , the brass details look so beautiful paired with it . <p> - <p> Who says a media console has to be functional only , why not a beautiful piece of furniture too ? I loved this lacquered black console in the family room . <p> - <p> I also admired the consistent flooring throughout , this was a wide plank pale oak flooring , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was beautiful to use it on all floors , it appears the builder finished the edges of the stairs with mitered trim . <p> - <p> - <p> Yay for wood ! The kitchen featured- stained wood cabinetry and marble countertops , and- a- little niche created with these open shelves . <p> - <p> The tour concluded with a wine tasting by J Lohr on one of the outdoor decks overlooking downtown Oakland and the San Francisco Bay beyond . The sun popped out just in time to admire the view , so beautiful ! <h> 12 comments <p> Although white cabinets look so pretty its refreshing to see stained wood for once ! I chose almost black cabinets in my kitchen but kept everything else light .. white marble looking laminate counters , wide plank gray and white laminate flooring , white walls , white subway tile etc . I wanted it to be a little different than what you see everyday . <p> Love the layers , the calm feeling without being boring . This really inspires me to include more plants inside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I like the overall look of the stairs , the workmanship seemed quite sloppy , a bit surprising for a showcase . <p> I used a free sample of wallpaper as a backsplash behind perspex in my downstairs powder room . We did n't  seal it and unless you look very closely you cant really see any damage . That was around 7-8 years ago . I still love the paper so have n't thought long and hard about changing it yet . I was so impressed at the idea and how cheap it was ( would have been around $6 for the perspex ) , that when I replaced our kitchen last year I wallpapered it with something bold and installed perspex behind the sinks and hob . Again its not sealed ( in fact Ive not yet screwed the perspex to the wall ! ) and there 's no damage and a quick wipe is all that 's needed . I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who 's on the fence about whether it will work ! <p> Maybe it looked better in person , but that glass over the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an odd choice for a showcase home . Gorgeous wallpaper though . I like the layered rug look too , but not in every room of the house ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057667 @3257667/ <h> Go Right Ahead and Paint That Laminate <p> By Kate Riley April 27 , 2010 <p> We 've owned this laminate and particle board media center for about fifteen years . It was purchased in the leaner years from a discount furniture store . Back in the 90s , we used it in our family room to store all of our media equipment , but then we eventually moved it to the kids ' play space . For the longest time ( like most moms ) I was just grateful for the storage it brought me and I did n't care what color it was . <p> Then all of a sudden I just could n't take it anymore . I was staring at the faux maple laminate last week and I decided the day had come . It was time to paint it ! It 's not that I do n't like blonde wood , I just do n't like faux blonde wood . It 's the fakeness that bothers me . <p> So it was time to rid my world of the maple tone and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively sturdy piece , so rather than go out and buy a new system , or build one myself , I determined the best way to save it was to simply paint it . The best part of all is , I changed the look of this piece in 48 hours ! <p> Here 's the Before : <p> Here 's the After : <p> Here 's how I painted my laminate storage center . <p> Make sure you invest in the right primer . This is absolutely key . You absolutely must prime your laminate surface with a primer designed to adhere to glossy surfaces . No ordinary primer will do . There are several options out there , my best piece of advice is to read the back of the can . Zinsser happens to be my primer of choice . I 've worked with others and I 've been disappointed , so I always return to this product . <p> Oil based Zinsser grips like glue in my opinion , and without sanding . You can use the water based version by Zinsser in the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beforehand , and you also must wait for the water based version to fully cure , which is a recommended 7 days . Zinsser 's oil based primer dries in two hours , so I was able to apply two coats of primer in one day . <p> Roll your primer on your piece of furniture , then follow up with a brush in all the crevices . This primer dries really fast , but if you want a longer time to work with your primer and minimize brush strokes , use an additive called Penetrol that I 've talked about here and here . <p> Many people shy away from oil based products because they require paint thinner or mineral spirits to clean up . However , if you use a cheap roller and cheap brush ( my combo costs less than $2 dollars ) , you can toss them out when you 're done and not have to worry about cleaning your brush or roller with mineral spirits . But it 's good to have some on hand anyway just to get any paint off your hands ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove any drips , buildup or brush marks . Follow up with two coats of your paint color of choice . Use a better quality brush to minimize your brush strokes . You can go right over oil based primer with latex paint . <p> While I was at it , I even painted these inexpensive mini cabinets to hold the kids movies and other toys . I primed them with the same Zinsser oil based product , then gave them two coats of the new wall color , which is some leftover BM Camouflage ' mixed in with some of the spring green from these chairs . <p> Yes , my kids watch movies on a VCR " they 're cheap ! $1 dollar each at the local Goodwill , ca n't beat that ! <p> And for those of you who are wondering , yes the giant map is still there , just on the opposite wall ! <p> Various bins and baskets from Target , Michaels and Pottery Barn . I made the pillow cover with some Annie Selke fabric . <p> So if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to freshen , go ahead and paint it ! Got laminate countertops ? Check out this post on Our Suburban Cottage ! Want to use water based primer instead ? Visit Lindsay and see how she transformed her laminate armoire . <p> I 'm adding this to Kimba 's DIY Day over at A Soft Place to Land , hop on over and check out all the great DIY links ! <h> 179 comments <p> Wow ! That piece looks great so crisp and new . I did read Lindseys post on painting laminate so that I could start painting a cheap-o credenza for our office . By the time I let the first coat cure , I had moved on to other projects and there it still sits ( only partially primed ! ) So I think I will go with your primer and finish it up ! <p> Very nice outcome ! I hate to clean up with mineral spirits too , so I also toss the brushes ( stealthily ) in the trash . The last time I painted laminate was about 12 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from living it up in California , I might add ) and saw what I 'd done : ) <p> Thanks so much for this . I love that you do n't  have to sand the nasty laminate . One questiondo you find that books/video cases tend to stick to the paint ? Ive painted some bookcases before and had that problem , but I 'm not sure what I did wrong . Do I need to follow up the paint with some poly ? <p> Hi Cecily ! I havent had that problem . I used a flat latex paint and let it completely dry , so no problems with anything sticking to the paint . A coat of Polycrylic will help protect your paint job , but I did n't  deem it necessary in this case . In fact , the kids are already sliding their baskets around and no scratches yet its that primer that holds the paint on the piece . Read the post at Our Suburban Cottage that I linked to- she used a protective coat over her paint on her countertops for added protection . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat has helped protect her surface . <p> Kate , this was so helpful ! Weve got some ugly old laminate pieces leftover from my husbands bachelor days that I 'd love to revamp because we need the storage ! This is a much nicer option than buying new stuff . Thanks , girl ! <p> Wow , the new storage unit looks amazing ! This post couldnt have come at a better time as I have been wanting to paint an old laminate dresser for a while now . If you do n't  mind , could you tell me what kind of white paint you used on the unit ? It looks like that " perfect " crisp white I am going for . Thanks in advance ! <p> Great post ! Lots of good information . Your storage space shows up so much better now . I love it ! And we still use vcr tapes too . You just cant beat the price , and I do n't  have the heart to throw out good disney movies just because they are on tape . : ) <p> Bravo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paint can do ! Ive primed and painted a laminate piece beforeI did n't  use anything special , but I wish I had b/c I know it wont hold up forever . <p> My girls have bunches of Disney movies on VHS too . : ) I can usually find them for anywhere from 0.25 to $1.00 at yard sales or Salvation Army . We have some new DVDs too , but I love finding my old favorites on VHS ( Petes Dragon or Mickey Mouse , anyone ? ) : ) <p> Wowthat looks fantastic ! I love the amazing results that can be achieved with paint . <p> I have an 8 foot long work table that is made of wood , but the top has some kind of laminate veneer on it . Have you ever painted that type of thing ? It is a great table , but the top is U.G.L.Y . After reading this , I am thinking I can probably paint it if I use a good primerYAH ! <p> Kate , it looks wonderful ! I personally love Zinssers B-I-N primer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dries within minutes and sticks like glue to glossy surfaces . Plus , its very thin so it does n't  create a build-up like some thicker primers can ( no need for penetrol ! ) . The only problem is you need to clean up with Denatured Alcohol , but that is the same issue as with oil-based , just a different solvent . <p> If painting a dark color or black , absolutely have your primer tinted ! The oil based Zinsser in the brown can is tintable , but the primer can only be tinted to a medium gray shade at best . Zinsser does have a deep tint primer which will tint very dark but note that its water based and takes the same week long period of time to fully harden . <p> WOW Kate that looks gorgeous ! I wouldve never guessed it was laminate ! I have phased out most of my laminate pieces but still ( unfortunately ) have a few billy bookcases from Ikea . I doubt that theyll make it through this move in 2 weeks thoughnot like I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find the right product to adhere to glossy surfaces . ( We live in Argentina . ) Sherwin Williams has a store here and that 's where we 've had the best success finding good quality paint and supplies . We have a kitchen to re-vamp that has old laminate everywhere . And I do mean everywhere ! <p> I just love this post ! Thanks for sharing . I saw a little tiny article about painting laminate countertops ( in a kitchen ) in that 100 decorating ideas under $100 or something like that magazine . There is a NEW product out that combines primer AND the latex paint to specifically use on a laminate countertop . I bought some ( its even tintable by the paint people ) and I cant wait to use it on my countertops . I thought you might be able to use it on laminate furniture but your way is probably much more economically sound . Thanks again for sharing . <p> Wow , I am sooooo glad you posted about this ! ! ! About 2 weeks ago I painted our laminate kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant remember the name ) that claimed would adhere to slippery surfaces , even tile . I used it , followed the instructions to wait 24 hours , then proceeded to paint them with the standard kitchen latex paint . 2 coats , by the way . To my frustration , the darn paint peels off so easily . If I grab a cabinet to open it and avoid using the hardware , the paint slides right off . I was puzzled but after reading your post I see why . Ill have to repaint them and this time with an oil based primer . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . By the way , I LOVE your blog and appreciate tremendously the inspiration you give me with all your fabulous ideas . Keep on being fabulous ! <p> Kate-the cabinet looks fab ! Have you ever painted any of that " pseudo " wood trim that 's not quite MDF and not quite real wood but more of a strand wood ? I have it all around my baseboards and windows and it is so builders grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether your laminate treatment might work on the baseboard and window trim ? Thanks so much Kate for sharing all of your ideas and projects ! <p> This is exactly the post I needed ; thank you ! I 've got a laminate cabinet that I 'm dying to spiff up . Its very plain , so I 'm thinking of adding some trim and painting it . I love your suggestion for the primer . <p> Thank you so much for the postIve been ruminating for months over what to do about a laminate dresser . I really had no clue , and because I had no clue , i just kept putting it off , but now that you 've made it so easy , I could tackle it this weekend ! Thanks so much ! <p> Oh my goodnessthis came just in time for me ! ! I was just about to tackle the daunting project of painting 3 HUGE ( and ugly ) laminate bookshelves we inherited from my in-laws . I was heading to Home Depot for some primer and I 'm so glad I have your recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just found the Bible of painting furntiure on your site . haha ! Thank you so much for posting ! <p> Oh no ! Another thing on my extremely long to-do list ( I have n't even gotten to my piano yet ) are laminate bookshelves and entertainment center . The color went well in my apartment , but it does not match my new house . I 've bookmarked this post so I remember what primer you use ! I was dreading having to sand laminate ( in like a year from now ) . <p> Hi there , that came up great ! I actually started my furniture painting career on laminate pieces so I could practice my technique and get it rightlucky for me my first piece came up better than I imagined , it turns out I have some natural talent for this ! Here in New Zealand we have a fantastic product by Resene called Smooth Surface Sealer , and it is waterbased . It is magic stuff.I have even painted over mirrors in the back of china cabinets and you would n't know once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wondering what I had done wrong with the bookshelf I just painted a week ago . I had primed it , then painted it and then , when it was too late , I realized you good scrap off the paint with a fingernail .. so disappointing ! It looks great but I 'm not sure for how long . Well , at least I now know what I did wrong and wont make the same mistake again ! <p> Your armoire came out beautifully ! I 've got a few pieces of laminate that I 'll be practicing on eventually now ! <p> Have you seen the products that " claim " to provide coverage that 's sturdy on laminate counter tops ? Am very curious what your take would be on painting those since they are usually high traffic areas like the kitchen and bath . I 'm not quite ready to take that plunge yet . <p> I have always shied away from painting laminate , but now I see I really need to give it a go . Your media cabinet looks fantastic ! I 'm always finding cheap laminate bookcases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool . Thanks for this post ! You are awesome . <p> That is good to know ! I have bookmarked this post for future project reference . I wish I had known about this process before I gave up my laminate dresser from childhood ( since I had limited room during our last move and it was 1970s hideous , heh ) . Thanks so much for sharing this info with your readers ! <p> WOW ! Thanks for giving me some hope with laminate ! It is inspiring to see how much of a transformation that made . Thanks also for the tip on the oil based primer . I HATE to sand stuff ! The hubs usually ends up doing that part so now if I tell him about the primer trick , he will love you too ! <p> They are beautiful . I have an older lingerie chest with formica on the top , its on my list of re-dos so I 'm hoping this same Zinser Primer will work on formica . Thanks for all of your suggestions and for being the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that there 's a countertop paint which you can buy at any home improvement store , made especially for laminate ? We just painted our kitchen countertops , and I LOVE THEM now ! ! We had painted our cabinets white a year ago , got white appliances , but our counters were still beige . Now they 're tan , and it looks fabulous : ) <p> This is the single most useful tutorial I have found on the internet ! We are painting out laminate kitchen cabinets and with your help , they have a chance to turn out great ! I loveeeeeee your site , tackling a headboard next . Thanks so much for sharing all of your ideas ! <p> I was just at Home Depot and was so excited to see this oil based Zinnser primer in a spray can ! I have a couple laminate pieces to paint for our new babys room and the spray can should make the priming so much faster and easier . ( Though I think I have to wait to do it til after the baby is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tip for you : instead of using a chemical to remove the paint from your skin I use cooking oil ! it helps break down the oil in the paint and I rub it on my hands and then wash off with a hand soapit may take a few goes to get it all off , but it saves my skin getting dried out by the chemical paint remover ; ) <p> You 're my hero ! Ive been staring at a laminate t.v. stand for 2 years trying to muster the gumption to paint it , I stumbled across your page this morning searching for tips on how to transform my Oak table and spent 2 hours admiring your work and voila I saw this and I finally have the courage to go for it , in fact this message is short because I 'm headed to the hardware store to pick up some Zinsser primer . Thank you for the inspiration , your work is beautiful ! <p> Do you have any tips on fixing up a botched job.BEFORE finding this article I primed ( with the water based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the paint just scratched right off any way I can fix this do I need to sand all the previous paint job right off or can I just sand the parts that are scratched and then reprime any ideas ? <p> Now that it has been a few months , is the paint is staying put ? I want to paint a couple of laminate pieces I have , but I do n't  want my hubby to be able to say that ever annoying , " I told you so . " lol = ) Anyway , thank you ! <p> Does anyone know if you can use a metallic paint with this process ( to paint laminate furniture ) ? I am eager to try this out and would love to pain an old laminate table with a metallic ( silver ) paint . Would this still work ? I am incredibly novice and think maybe I should just stick to normal paint but am not sure what other color would work . I 'd really appreciate any tips . Thanks . <p> OMG , thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large dresser type furniture and have seen a couple of blogs that inspired me but not very much details on the how to . I wrote my notes down and will hopefully start this weekend . Thanks again ! <p> Okay question , once you have the rolled &amp; brushed oil based primer on would you use spray paint for your color coats ? I am really concerned about brush strokes but it is a rather large piece . Any suggestions or tips ? Thanks ! <p> We had our home painted by professional painters three years ago , and when I asked them about some of our ugly but very functional laminate furniture , they told me to paint it . Ive been a skeptical about the possible outcome . After seeing your photos , I 'm definitely encouraged ! Its going to take work and patience , but I just do n't  see the need to go out an buy more furniture . Thank you for taking time to share these photos and details . <p> Oh how I wish I would have learned this a year ago ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can not tell you how many coats of paint it took . And then I never finished the inside " ceilings " of the cubbies because I was just exhausted . This post gives me new encouragement to finish that cubby and also paint these two hideous discount book shelves I have . Thanks so much ! <p> OMG ! You do n't  KNOWhow valuable this info is for me right now ! ! ! I have UGLY furniture that I bought about 7 years ago .. was n't ugly then ! hahahaha still its the same type of furniture . I will be doing this on the weekend ! * Priscilla ! <p> Your media center looks great ! I 'm actually wanting to do the same to mine but i would like to use metallic paints to give it that old hollywood mirrored effect . Would anyone have any tips on how to go about doing that ? <p> I am SO glad I found your blog ! It is incredibly inspirational to me . I am about to embark on my first laminate painting job , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Consider yourself bookmarked . <p> This inspired me to paint my entertainment center . HOWEVER , in the lovely state of Ohio , there was no oil based Zinser to be found so I got the latex version . I 'm proud of myself for being so patient ( OMW , its so hard ! ! ) , but its been 4 days , and I can scratch it off still . Boo on you Ohio and your stinkin ban on oil based lovliness . Hopefully a miracle happens in the next 3 days . : ) <p> I 'm baaaaa-aaaaaack ! This time to say that my laminate experiment was a success ! Thank you for the inspiration , and for giving me the confidence to try this daunting project . You can see my results here , if you like ! LONG ... <p> Hey ! Thanks for this tutorial . I was just wondering about peeling the laminate before you paint . Did you peel it all off first ? Or paint over it ? Did it peel up anywhere after its been painted and used ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to paint my nasty bookcase of dark brown wood laminate/over particleboard . I wiped it down but did not sand it as it was so old anyway . I bought some lime green spray paint ( Valspar for PLASTICS ) and it worked great . Took 3 cans and lots of coats but you only have to wait 5-10 minutes between coats . It looks like I did it with a roller for $15 . <p> We wanted to paint with acrylic paint hand prints on a bench that is pressed board/finished laminate . Is that possible ? we do not want to sand or prime itwill the paint stick ? Thank you so much for your help.I have googled it so much but with no luck <p> Hi Maria , unfortunately most acrylic paints will not stay permanent without a primer between the laminate and the acrylic paint . It might " stick " at first , but it will easily scratch off . To make it permanent , use a layer of primer designed for laminates or glossy surfaces . Kate <p> I have been planning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My only concern is if they peel off or scratch off with frequent use ? That would be worse that just leaving them like they are . I have also used that Zinsser product to paint all the workwork in my previous house , as they had spray laquered it after painting it and it worked well . I just do n't  want to end up with a scuffed mess . Has anyone put there 's to heavy use yet ? <p> Hi Patty , I used Zinsser Cover Stain ( with Penetrol additive ) to paint my kitchen island , no scuffs to date and its been two years . The island was painted wood , not laminate , but I 've used the Zinsser CS on several laminate projects ( entertainment center , credenza , shelving ) and have been very pleased with the way it holds up . I prefer it to any other bonding primer for laminate or glossy surfaces . Good luck with your kitchen painting project ! Kate <p> I painted my laminated ( fake wood ) paneling in my family room and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lasted for years ( we did it about ten years ago ) ! its a great product to usehighly recommend it ! <p> I have been trying to find the best way to paint furniture . I look up different tutorials and simply try different things for each of my project . I have never used the oil based primer followed by latex paint combo . I 've used latex paint in the past and it had stuck to items that I put on the piece . Does it not do that with an oil based primer ? Or do you put a clear coat ( like polycyclic ) over it ? <p> Hi Ansley , you can always layer latex or oil based paint over oil based primer , but it does n't  work that well the other way around I would n't put oil based paint on top of latex primer , but most of the water based paints these days are so great there 's no need to use oil based paints , the modern enamels are especially nice for furniture . <p> Kate , thank you so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just heard its tons easier to deal with . If I use the mentioned oil based primer , what type of spray paint would I use ? Thanks again so much ! ! ! <p> Hi , I painted a laminate table top today , after reading your wonderful blog post . I used exactly the same primer ( its actually made in Australia , woohoo ! ) and did everything you said , exactly as you said . No I did n't  sand first . I have put one top coat on and just taken a look at it and there is a chip off the top already . I put my finger nail across it and the paint just all came off . Plus I have major tanin stains on the legs . Isnt it meant to be a stain blocker ? I shook the can before I applied ( which is says is okay on the can ) . I can only guess it might not have been mixed properly . Any ideas ? I 'm really disappointed with the result . Thanks , Julie <p> Hi Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of problem with the Cover Stain , but yes , it does need to be mixed properly . Also I 'm a big believer in scuffing up a piece first with a sanding wedge to " open the pores " to help the primer grab on . I 'm so sorry you 're having a bad experience , I have had nothing but success with the product which is why I 'm always using it . Try sanding it down in the problem spots and reapplying . Good luck ! Kate <p> Want to paint my bathroom cabinets quickly and slightly painless process 1st time-original 94 ones as kitchen are toowhat type paint product should I get and keep with the primer and minor sanding ? Any thoughts on something call bull 1-2-3 or something similar named , My color choice something teal/purplish as gt tiling finally .. and next steps will be bathroom walls Appreciate any help and tips . Since currently unemployed Teresa <p> I do n't  know if anyone has mentioned it but I read somewhere that vegtable oil will take it off your hands so when I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I got it all over my hands and arms .. and legs .. and feet .. do n't  ask : ) anyway I thought I would try the veg oil before I sent hubby out for something and it worked great ! ! ! ! ! even took it right outta the brush and roller ! ! <p> Awesome post ! If you do n't  want to keep harmful materials like mineral spirits around you can use plain coconut or cooking oil to remove the oil paint from your hands . Like removes like , I use this trick all the time works great + you have nice soft hands when you are done : ) <p> I just purchased some cheap furniture from a model home furniture sale . The laminate is dark and I want to change the color . Knowing that I could use your tutorial for reference , I went ahead and made the purchases . My projects will be a 3 panel hinged shutter screen and a small desk . I 'm really excited to begin . <p> Hi ! I am so excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to paint . It is the bathroom vanity and I was wondering if there was an extra step like a finishing coat of something I should add being that it is the bathroom ( steam , water splashes , etc ) . <p> I am wanted to paint a dresser for my babies nursery . I am pregnant so I am worried about fumes with oil based primers . I did find that Zinsser carries an odorless oil based primer . Do you think that would work just as well without sanding the dresser first ? <p> Hi Carissa , I do n't  think Zinssers oil based primer is odorless , I believe its their new and improved water based formula . I tried it once but went back to the oil based , I find it more durable , but you certainly can work with the low VOC version if you prefer . Kate <p> Hi Kate ! Did you sand between coats of primer or just slap another coat on top of the first one ? Also , are any of your children of the toddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to take long enough naps to paint an entire piece of furniture ? ! <p> Hey Melanie ! I did have toddlers once and yes , painting during naptime was a habit back then I only sand any drips or brush marks in between coats , and always lightly , but often its not necessary . Kate <p> Thank you for illustrating and explaining how to paint laminates . I 'm looking forward to trying your techniques on several pieces of mine . I will do a follow up with you . I may include pictures of my work . One thing at a time for me . Its painting laminate and then taking digital pictures . Have a great day . Donna <p> Hey there I was wondering what about cabinets ? Same thing ? I have cabinets from probably the 80s and I want them WHITE ! So just follow your steps ? I do believe they are laminet and they are glossy . Thanks so much for posting this ! ! ! ! Im THRILLED to find this out ! ! ! ! <p> Hello ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be perfect for my little ones toy room . I know it was purchased a long time ago , but I would love to find the same unit or one similar . Would you happen to remember the discount furniture store you got it from ? Ive been looking everywhere and I have n't had any luck . Let me know if you remember . Great job and thanks ! ! ! ! <p> I love your blog . I notice you use chalk paint quite a bit on your projects although not this one . Ive read you do n't  need to use a primer with chalk paint is that true ? And is it true for laminate furniture ? I 've got an Ikea cabinet that I 'd LOVE to paint . : ) Thanks so much ! <p> I painted a laminate dresser and bookshelf white a couple of years ago using the same primer . Both pieces began chipping only a couple of months later . Do you know what I maybe did wrong ? And to repaint them how do I get the old paint off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Nikki , I 'm not sure what went wrong in your case . There 's no need to strip the units , but you might try this product for chipping and/or LONG ... If you painted with latex , you can repaint over it with more latex paint after you 've repaired the chips/peels . Kate <p> Do you put any kind of finish on afterwards ? Like polyurethane or something like that ? Soooo , going to try this with our wood and laminate built in entertainment center . That honey oak color has GOT to go . ; ) <p> Love this post . I will be working on painting some laminate this weekend . Question for you , though . The stuff i will be painting is already white . Do I still need to prime ? I did n't  know if the primer was more for covering the wood finish or to help the paint stick better ( or both even ) . Thanks for your help . <p> Now that Spring has finally showed up the past few weeks , I will be getting out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cabinets . I looked in the paint cabinet and there are a lot of paints that I feel need to go . I spied a gallon can of Zinnser Stain blocker/primer and wondering now how long that would keep or if I should just take it to landfill . I thought DH had written on the top of can the date we purchased it but did n't  see that information but know that it has been about 4 years since any painting was done around here . <p> High Schools can always use left over paint fro painting props so if the paint is n't too old , call and offer it to the drama dept . <p> If I were doing a small side table , do you think that Zinnser would still be good to use for a primer ? Is there a specific type of paint roller that you use for painting furniture or do you do all of it by paint brush or spray paint ? <p> I have a table , that has a fake wood panel , I 'm trying to paint over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps cracking and looks horrible . Is this primer what I need to do the table to stop the cracking ? <p> I use cover stain as a primer almost exclusively . Instead of tossing your roller you can put it in the freezer . I have done this and weeks later when you thaw it out it can be used again . ( I do have an extra freezer though , it might stink up your freezer if you only have one . ) <p> HELP ! I used the cover stain primer over a large desk that I thought might be to glossy for just my homemade chalk paint to adhere to . the only way I could apply it was with a roller . Its been a couple hours and the texture is awful from the roller ( all bumpy ) . I tried to sand it smooth and it wont sand . still has that awful texture . I should have just used the chalk paint . is there any way I can get a smooth texture or brushed on texture . I 'm panicking <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a few houses in the past , and I have painted every room . My husband says I should be a professional . But when we bought our most recent home , and I saw that someone had put up laminate countertop material on the walls in my guest bathroom , I thought I would have to do a demo . I much prefer to make repairs and restore . So , after reading your site and a few others online , I am now going to tackle this project , as well as restore the cabinets . Then I will replace the mirror , lighting , and hardware perhaps going to a Habitat store . So , much less expensive than a demo and I can do it myself . Thanks ! ! 23102 @qwx883102

I have a new DIY project to share today : fabric covered boxes perfect for storing keepsakes or office supplies . I love the idea of wrapping plain boxes in pretty patterns ( like I did last year these marbled paper versions ) and this time I made them with some beautiful fabrics sent to me by Annie Selke from her Pine Cone Hill collection . <p> Here is the step by step : <p> First , round up the necessary supplies . You 'll need about -+ yard of fabric for every box , sometimes more for larger versions . Find wood boxes at a craft store like Michaels , also glue designed for fabric and a brush to apply it . For thicker fabrics , you 'll need a staple gun too . <p> Next , cut the fabric to the size of the box and allow for enough fabric to wrap all fours sides . <p> With your staple gun , secure the first long side of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Apply a thin coat of glue to the bottom of the box and smooth the fabric as you rotate it around so that it lays flat along the bottom . <p> Staple the second side along the interior of the box , concentrating the staples toward the middle . <p> Trim a piece of remaining fabric on the unwrapped sides so that you can easily wrap it up and around the edge without bulky excess . Add an additional layer of glue to the sides . <p> Fold the trimmed fabric up and over the side of the box and secure it tight with the staple gun . <p> Repeat the same process for the lid , but keep the fabric stapled to the bottom edge of the lid to avoid the box becoming too difficult to close due to excess layers of fabric . <p> In less than an hour you can create two stylish storage boxes for housing office supplies or mementos . <p> What a lovely site ! I went to look at the yardage choices for this giveaway , but kinda got lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and browse/dream ! I would have a hard time narrowing it down , but I do like Toadstool Verdi and Key Lime . All so cheery ! Thanks for sharing and for this giveaway ! <p> I have to choose one ? Then I choose Hot House Floral Spring Cut Yardage ! My husband and I just bought our first house together two weeks ago , and I 'm really excited to make this place our own . I love the blues and greens on this print , its how I envision our new home to be ! <p> So hard to choose just one ! I love the toadstool and the edelweiss . I made pillow covers for my living room couch out of the hothouse floral spring cut , and those pillows are my favorite thing in the whole house ! Its all so beautiful . Thanks for the chance to win ! <p> Hi Kate , love your blog , and idea about the fabric covered boxs very cool !

Thanks for the giveaway and I hope I 'm the lucky winner . <p> I just moved into a new sewing room and boy is it drab ! It could sure use some Happy Poppies Pink fabric to brighten it up ! And the fabric covered boxes would go a long way in getting me organized . This fabric line is nothing short of AMAZING ! ! ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057669 @3257669/ <h> Refinishing with Oil Based Primer &amp; Paint <p> By Kate Riley October 24 , 2009 <p> Over the course of our remodel , we hired a dear friend Mike to handle some of the larger painting projects. - Mike is a professional painter with 20 years experience , and a wealth of information when it comes to choosing paint products. - Mike has taught me a lot about painting , and is always available when I have questions about what products I should use . <p> So when I picked up a buffet and hutch back in August at the local St. Vincent de Paul thrift store , I knew I wanted to give it a fresh coat of white paint. - Most of the time , when I 'm brushing or rolling paint on walls or furniture , I choose latex for its quick drying time and easy cleanup. - For this hutch , I wanted a paint job that was extremely durable with a very hard shell glossy finish. - Oil based primer and paint was the answer . <p> Here 's the Before and After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get lost in the sea of available products out there. - I 've used most of them , oil and water based , and in both spray and brush application . <p> Choosing the right primer really depends on what you 're trying to accomplish . <p> For stain blocking or bonding to a non-sanded surface , oil will cover better than latex. - I 've learned that porous surfaces like raw wood soak up an oil based primer much better than a water based primer. - Oil based primers will resist shrinkage over time. - Most spray primers are oil based , so I 've often chosen the spray version for quick application . <p> However , water based primers have come a long way , and can often do what oils can do. - Zinsser 's Bulls Eye in the blue can is very good at doing what its oil based partner does : - sticking to glossy surfaces , stain blocking , and inhibiting rust. - And the water based formula cleans up with water , which is a big advantage in my book. - Cleaning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires the use of mineral spirits or paint thinner. - The best advice I can give in choosing a primer is to simply take the time to read the back of the product you 're considering and ask a lot of questions . <p> For my buffet and hutch , I knew I would be finishing in oil based paint , so that requires an oil based primer. - Note , you can use latex paint over oil primer , but the reverse is not a good idea. - Most paint professionals will tell you it is not advisable to use oil based paint over- water based- primer . - I chose to use my favorite bonding and sealing primer : Zinsser 's oil based in the brown can. - ( Zinsser has not paid me to say this. - I 've used this product over the years with great satisfaction so I 'm a big fan. ) - Note that primers are always tintable , so if your final paint color will be a medium to dark shade , you can always have your paint department tint the primer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When it 's time to paint , one of my biggest frustrations is when the paint starts to dry too fast and starts to drag on the surface. - Visible brush strokes are maddening. - - So here 's the big secret I 've picked up from my professional painter friend Mike . When applying an oil based primer or paint , the best thing you can do to increase paint adhesion and eliminate brush strokes is to invest in an additive called Penetrol. - It 's like conditioner for paint. - When you mix a few tablespoons of this product into your paint , it extends your working time and creates better flow across your painted surface , greatly decreasing your brush strokes. - This product really helps achieve a smooth glossy surface , which is especially important when refinishing furniture . <p> Penetrol is only for oil based primer and paint. - You can find a similar product for latex paint called Flotrol . <p> Be gone vile brush strokes " Penetrol to the rescue ! <p> Why did this project take me a month to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass panels could not be removed , so I was twisting and turning in all sorts of awkward ways to try to get my primer and two coats of paint applied inside the cabinet and on the shelves. - Since oil take forevah to dry ( well more like 24 to 36 hours ) , I did the primer one week , the first coat of paint the second week , entertained family the third week , and applied the second coat of paint the fourth week. - Then it had to dry and I had to muscle it into my house and up a flight of stairs. - Whew- ! <p> Here 's one final observation. - When painting next to glass panels , I 've decided not to bother with painter 's tape anymore. - I used tape on the outside panels , but not the inside and I 've come to this conclusion : - It 's so much easier and cleaner to be old school and use a razor blade to scrape off paint. - And after a month of painter 's tape and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off clean despite all of my efforts . <p> But if you use a blade , PLEASE do n't do what I did and hack at it with a small blade. - - Please do as I say , and NOT as I do. - I have a tool that I could n't find that has a blade on the end of a very sturdy handle. - Thank goodness I did n't injure myself with just this little ol ' rusty blade ! <p> I bought this cabinet not for any dining space , but to house my stepdaughter 's collectibles in her bedroom. - Sadly , the lass is off to college next year , so I 'm trying to swankify a space that 's looked too tween for a little too long. - For her final year at home , we are upgrading her room to a more ladylike space with a romantic cottage feel. - This cabinet suits our needs perfectly. - Since it will eventually be a guest room ( ** sigh sniffle ** ) it needs to be more adult like. - Plus I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her childhood memories behind glass . <p> Years ago , we chose a color for her walls that in my humble opinion is a watered down version of Tiffany Blue. - My girl loves turquoise and white , so we painted her walls Blue Green Gem ' by Kelly Moore. - I applied the same paint color to the back of the hutch . <p> Ooooh that glossy shine. - It 's worth all the trouble for a piece as pretty as this . <p> Her room will be finished after a few more upgrades and DIY projects. - Look for them in the upcoming weeks . <p> The debate goes on between the use of oil based versus latex paint. - There are several helpful articles online. - This one from Home Additions Plus weighing the pros and cons. - EHow has another brief article on advantages and disadvantages. - For a great blog post on latex versus oil , visit- Jenny at - Little Green Notebook for her- smart observations . <h> 65 comments <p> Kate , that is a gorgeous finish . I 'm too lazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so latex for me . My sister followed some directions from someone at the big box stores &amp; primed her beautiful pine hutch with oil-based primer and then painted it black with a latex AND the black is now coming off . Ca n't figure out why that happened , but it did . I would have told her to just use a regular latex primer and paint with latex . But , now she 's going to have to deal with chipping paint on top of the primer . I 've never had a problem with my latex chipping off either , but your finish definitely looks PRO ! <p> We just moved to Indiana and we have the St. Vincent de Paul thrift stores here too . I 'm wondering if its a chain or if you live near me . Hmmm.if you live near me maybe that 's why I have n't been able to find some of the things I 'm looking for in the thrift stores you 're getting them first ! ha ! = ) I 've actually been looking for a hutch like that . You did good ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra details . I know I have lots of furniture refinishing in my future , so this will be very helpful . I actually refinished two nightstands , a vanity , and a bookshelf two summers ago which you can see here : LONG ... I did n't  know all of these tips , however , and definitely had to learn on my own . Its definitely something I enjoy doing , though , and love to see how others can transform things with paint into something spectacular ( like your hutch ) . I bet the room is going to look incredible I cant wait for the reveal ! <p> The hutch is absolutely gorgeous . I love it painted white with the beautiful blue inside . Thanks for the great information also . It really helps to have some professional tips . Thank you also for the gracious comments you always leave on my blog . I so appreciate your visits . Hugs , Marty <p> I love everything you do ! I am subscribed to you in my google reader , but for some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of your posts do you know why ? I love your blog but its a pain to have to switch over from my reader for each post ! Love the hutch ! ! <p> Beautiful . Thank you for all the tips , but I have a question regarding brush strokes . Ca n't you just paint with a roller ? I have been using small foam rollers for furniture and the finish looks great . No brush strokes , even pain and a smooth finish . Either latex or oil based work for me , but I would never use a brush ; I just would n't know how to use it properly . <p> I love how it turned out ! I am also a fan of Zinsser primer ( waterbased ) and have used it constantly in my quest to rid our house of all of the honey oak trim and cabinets . Another paint I love is the Ace brand cabinet door and trim paint . It is self-leveling and gives that shell hard look of an oil with the ease a water-based . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you do next ! <p> Thank you so much for this post ! Just last week as I was working on my bookcase , I was told by the paint merchandiser at Home Depot that " only old people use oil-based paint . " I disagreed , but by the end he talked me out of using a gallon of the perfect grey that I found on the oops rack . I normally use Kilz , but I think I 'm going to try the Zinsser next time . I just bought a sideboard to refinsh today and am debating between oil , latex , or the red spray paint that Jenny @ LGN used . I do have one more question thoughI tend to like furniture very glossy , so would you put a polyurethane on top of the oil , or does it come out glossy enough without ? Thanks again so much for your thoughts . <p> What a great piece for her room ! All that storage is great , too . I think the downside to using oil besides the cleaning up afterward is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you get oil in a low VOC ? I do n't  know alot about it firsthand , having always used latex paint . <p> WOW ! I have got to say that you have done one heck of a great job ! I love the result , love , love and love .. I knew most of what you wrote about oil based paint , and have a painter friend too , but just reading your post makes me want to break out the drop clothes , and put on my grunge clothes thank you for the peak ! smiles . <p> Kate , I love your new piece and finish .. It looks absolutely beautiful . My mama has been rehabbing furniture for about 50 years and SWEARS by oil based primers and paints . In fact , she 's gasped at me many a time for sticking with latex . It just seems like so much TROUBLE to use oil based products . Your piece was worth it though . I 'm in the middle of refinishing a hutch myself . I have the base coat on and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a lucky find . Its an exact replica of the one my mama has had all of my life except its a little bit smaller version . I think she went home and cried in her pillow when I told her I was painting it with latex ; ) Great job as usual ! <p> Hi Izzy , great question . Yep , a roller works wonders and is faster ! You 'll notice there are a lot of fine details on this piece that a roller would n't cover . That requires an angled brush . So I took my time with the brush and did n't  bother with a roller this time because I did n't  want to have to clean it up . Thats part of the reason it took me so long to finish I stuck with just one brush ! The Penetrol really minimized the brush strokes so I 'm pretty pleased . Also , I used a really high quality brush on this buffet &amp; hutch . Kate <p> Nice post . I agree with it all . I have seen first hand how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paint . Its amazing . I am kicking myself for using latex for our dining room set , its already chipping a little . BUt , it was so cold when we painted I would have had troubles with the fumes . I 've found that for trim ( and our recent wainscoting ) , using oil-based primer helps a lot . Since I only do one or two coats of primer , I do n't  have to deal with the smell as much and it helps absorb into the wood better . Ive been really satisfied with the finish . <p> I also agree that foam brushes are great to use for furniture , but sometimes the spaces needs a brush . <p> Your hutch is gorgeous ! Thanks for all the wonderful tips , as always ! Looking forward to reading all the articles . The SW guy told me yesterday that I should n't use Oil on my cabinets , that the kitchen paint is just as good , oh I 'm so cofused . <p> Its beautiful , Kate ! A piece of furniture to cherish . : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices when it comes to paints and primers . What you chose to go with sure looks like it worksI would have thought you bought the hutch in a showroom ! I also really like the way you all styled it . I was n't sure how it would look in a bedroom , but I love what you did . : ) Ca n't wait to see the rest of the roomdont even want to think about how I 'll feel when my kids go off to collegeyoure making me weepy ! <p> I LOVE the pictures , info , and tips . I might have missed it , but did you tell the name of the white you used ? My whites seem to come out a little dingy . This white is so crisp and clean . I love it . Please share the color and brand . THANKS ! <p> Kate , Excellent tips and very helpful details . I 'm in the middle of finding and " fixing " some furniture , so this is very timely for me . I appreciate the veteran sharing her experience ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very interesting post . I have gone back and forth about oil based vs . Latex . I constantly feel the texture of professional pieces of furniture and tap on it with my fingernails . I love the look of oil based paints and deep down I want to use it . But I 'm usually trying to keep my projects to as little money as I can . I used oil based paint on a little pot I had and I love the finish but the clean up is so annoying . I have found that if I am working on something with a smooth finish , I use a foam roller and a brush in the details parts . But this is the process I do and it turns our Really good . Prime , Sand , Paint 1st coat , sand , Paint 2nd coat , Sand with very fine paper , then give it a coat or two of polyeurathane . With that process I do n't  have to wait the 24 hours between coats . Thanks for the tutorial . It really answered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation of latex vs. oil . I stay away from oil based anything if I can , honestly because I knew it was hard to clean . I still do n't  know if I 'll ever take a shot at it ( other than spray paint , of course ) , but at least I 'm not so scared of it anymore ! <p> Again , I LOVE this piece . It is amazing ! I know how hard oil based paint can be to work with but it reallyis worth it in the end , especially for furniture . I also use it for crown and door trim . NOTHING looks as good or ages as well . I also use a skinny , short foam roller for the larger areas which really helps cut down on the brush strokes . My Dad is a painter with 35+ yrs experience and his thinking is that there is no primer necessary with oil based paint . I tend to agree just based on personal experience but I 'm sure it does n't  hurt ( especially if you lightly sand first ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anything ( according to him ) . <p> I cant wait to see the rest of the room and be inspired over and over again ! Have a beautiful day ! <p> I have to say this piece is gorgeous . I think I already told you that but I have to say it again . I have a couple of pieces that I want to redo when I get settled in our new home and I am going to follow your instructions . I will post them on my blog when they are finished . It could be a while though ; ) <p> I used oil based paint once and clean up was such a pain that I use water based whenever I can . <p> Since you 're a paint guru , have you heard anything about the durability of using low or no VOC paint ? I read an article in the New York Times Home section several years ago that professional painters say that a paint job with no/low VOC paint only lasts 2 years before it has to be repainted . That was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . do you know if that 's still true ? I cant find info either way . <p> this is very helpful . I 'm painting a bookcase black and thinks are not going well . my paint is bubbly , ugh and it is not smooth . I wonder if I should do a light sanding before I apply a NEW paint that I 'm going to go buy to day ( my paint is old and I 'm thinking that 's why its bubbly ? ) <p> Hi- new to your siteand I love your tips . I 'm in the process of refinishing some chairs for my living room and went with oil because of the pro finish it offers . Its been a true labor of love so far , but hopefully will be worth it ! <p> I 'm curiouswhat is the white color that you used for this job ? I like the look , and am always a little afraid of going to stark white , but hate to choose anything that will end up looking too creamy and give off a yellowed look . Your paint color would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to organize my office . I priced a white Kathy Ireland desk , hutch and entertainment center at over $4000 . That sent me to Craigs list where a few days later I found the same set used for $500.00 . Yeah ! I thought till after several weeks of research I decided on oil based enamel paint . I painted the hutch last night with primer and penatrol . I still landed with deep paint strokes . Today I will spend the day sanding it down . I think what I did wrong is used too much paint . Just guessing . The paint bushes I used are mohair . I tried the foam brushes too . I liked your idea to use spay paint for the primer . Hence I am off to the store today for that . I am keeping tabs on the cost I am still well below $4000 . However , my insistance on perfection is wanning ! If I want the finish I will have to slow down and accept the time consumption . <p> I have a hutch &amp; buffet very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is one of my first few projects and looks like a LOT of work . Your tutorials make it seem very do-able but I am wondering did you not sand this particular piece ? The piece I have is very high gloss which it sounds like yours was as well . So just primer it twice with oil based and then paint it with a coat or 2 ? ? ? <p> I FINALLY have the confidence to paint furniture ! All due to your tip on using Flowtrol . I used it this past weekend and painted a nightstand for my husbands side of the bed . NO STROKE MARKS ! And it looks fabulous , dahlink ! Thank you for the tip . <p> Now I am going to move to a large , victorian style dresser and have a couple of further questions . Did you sand between coats on this white buffet ? If yes , what grit did you use , and did you sand the final coat . <p> hej painting lovers , love your stuff , myself furniture painter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending paper after priming220 . You could add color to your primer if you use deep color . Acrylics small botels go long way , dry fast so once You finish you could start VERY delicate sending -400 paper and than Polyurethan if water base- dry fast no smell could be done inside house , if oil smelly toxic but looks great on gold metalics ! ! ! , for example top of comode or table that is going to be use a lot . I love water base floor semi gloss looks good on pastel oil ters amber polyurethan , Iput 3,4 times and send betwen 400 , last 600 sending paper and sometimes on dark colors wax with minwax paste I love that stuff , like rustic look but " smooth " finish good painting , put same good music on and paint better than prozac <p> I LOVE this , and am beginning the exact same project . I have started with the Zinnsers spray primer that is sillicon based , not oil or latex . My question is , should I redo the primer with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint ? ? And , should I add the Penetrol to the primer as well ? Just love all of your projects . Thank you for sharing them ! <p> Thank you Kate ! I apparently bought the super expensive primer from Zinsser .. lol . It covers easier , and adheres better ( according to the paint dept at Lowes ) , but is very comperable to the oil based version . They said they would only recommend it if covering something that had some grease spots/stains . I have already painted my cabinet , with oil based paint and the Penetrol additive , and it is fabulous ! ! Thank you for all the tips and posting the before/after pictures . Gave me the courage to try the oil based paint . LOVE IT ! <p> Thanks for the post . We have just move into a new home and my old china cabinet is to formal for the space in this house . After putting it on craigslist a million times I have decide to just repaint it . This will help ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057671 @3257671/ <h> Spray Paint : Pros and Cons <p> By Kate Riley August 10 , 2009 <p> I was finishing up a bench this morning , using one of my favorite tools : spray paint. - As I was working , I was going back over all of your emails that you 've sent to me asking questions about spray paint , expressing your fear or relaying your love for the aerosol can. - <p> In my humble opinion , these are the top ten pros and cons when it comes to the use of spray paint . <p> Pros <p> Spray paint offers more even coverage without brush strokes. - <p> Spray primer is a million times faster than brush primer. - <p> Spray paint is a million times faster than brush on paint . <p> Spray paint is typically oil based , therefore more durable than water based spray or regular latex paint . <p> Spray paint is easy to use outdoors , with a drop cloth and some newspaper . <p> Specialty spray paints can be used to transform metal , wicker , plastic , resin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint out of a can ( without an additive ) . <p> With a spray paint nozzle gun in hand , you can conquer the world , or at least , transform a piece of furniture without losing your mind to a million brush strokes . <p> Clean up is quicker " no brushes to rinse or buckets to wash . <p> Spray paint feels a little devious " at least in my state " you have to be of a certain age to purchase it . <p> Cons <p> Compared to latex paint , there are limited color choices beyond the great Heirloom White ' and some of the American Accents ' line by Rustoleum. - <p> Spray paint is more expensive per square foot of coverage . <p> Spray paint requires ventilated area in which to work. - You ca n't use it indoors. - <p> Drips are tricky. - I use my finger to wipe up drips , but they take away from the smoothness of even coverage . <p> Thanks for all of your tips for spray painting . Unfortunatly I have made every mistake there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the hard way . ( Where were you 6 months ago when I really started using spray paint ? LOL ) Thanks again . <p> I love how spray paint can be a quick and inexpensive way to give something a new look . My husband is a big fan of wearing a mask when doing any project that involves paint or dust . Thanks for the reminder on that . Another thing to consider is a well ventilated area . Like you said , " could n't be more toxic . " <p> Great tips , especially the mask , which seems silly but is important . I have used spray paint minimally , to cover a candelabra once . It worked great . I will say that recently , trying to paint over some other things ( like a dark wooden candle holder ) I was a bit frustrated with my regular paint and brush ! Honestly , never thought of spray paint , I might have to tackle it again with the can . I just tried some spray glitter the other day and had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop spraying lightly and leaked out those toxic chemicals all over , I promptly took it back to the store , those poor ladies were n't sure how to dispose of it but I felt it was very flammable and dangerous . Probably just a defect . <p> PLEASE get a Rustoleum Comfort Grip ! It will change your spray paint experience ! I will never again spray paint without it . Eliminates that painful , numb finger and gives such great control . Another thing I have used in the past month is Rustoleum 's new line of Ultra Cover 2X coverage spray paints . I am thrilled with the results over a regular can . Well worth it . <p> I have fallen ( back ) in love with spray paint recently . I 've become very fond of Oil Rubbed Bronze but have ventured to other colors . I will admit , though , that I have a ' fear ' of painting large furniture pieces but am trying to get over it . I currently have several pieces I am holding out painting because of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's paint in general . For some reason , I have a ' hang up ' about painting wood furniture ! **25;853;TOOLONG <p> I like the idea of spray paint , but I found in the past that I would get drips probably my own fault in not doing quick movements ( I 'm always in such a hurry to get it done ) . This was on 6 chairs I was painting white . I want to repaint them so I think I will just go slower and be more patient . <p> I love spray paint and buy my black paint very cheaply at Big Lots . ( I 've had good luck with cheap black varieties but do n't recommend messing around with the white . ) I heartily second the " wear a mask " warning . One day when I went a little black-spray-paint nuts and painted every piece of furniture I could get my hands onto , I had trouble breathing that night . I took a hot shower to try to loosen up my lungs and while there I sneezed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Firstew . And second , oh my goodness wear a mask ! I learned my lesson . I will never spray without a mask again . Scaryand totally gross . <p> Um , so I 'll admit itI 'm horrible when it comes to remembering to wear a mask . Not that I do n't HAVE themI just forget to wear it in all of the excitment of starting a new project ! I also have never read the " warning " on the can , so that might scare me into remembering now <p> I have never read the warning on the cans . If I read 50% of the warnings that are around in life I would n't have had 10% of the fun and learning experiences that I have had . <p> I have learned though , to let a piece sit outside for a few days to really cure . The fumes even 24 hours later are too much for this girls lungs . <p> My only issue with spray paint is the durability . I find that in a piece that gets a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paint . I guess because it is thicker , it can stand a ding or two without issues . <p> I just love spray paint recently I am spraying all the out-dated gold door knobs in my house with " hammered black " by Rustoleum . For $7 a can I redid 6 knobs which would have been $20 EACH to replace very nice ! <p> I am venturing into the world of spray paint but have been inspired by many projects in blogland and elsewhere ! I 've come really close to getting the oil rubbed bronze color to update some icky brass light fixtures but was scared b/c it has some texture to it . One of the posts mentioned it with approval so I 'm off to buy a can ! Also , I 've been toying with the idea of painting my knobs but was afraid that they would n't wear and look tacky I 'm hoping that ms. less is always more can elaborate ! ! ! ! <p> I think you are spot on with the pros and consand at least the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as I am endeavoring to redo a set of Chinese Chippendale chairs we inherited . I loathe the idea of painting all those knot , nooks , and crannies with a brush but we live in Brazil , and the spray paint options are next to nil ! sigh <p> I am really glad you mentioned the environmental factor that 's what always kept me from using it . I never stopped to think that OF COURSE you can take spray cans to the paint disposal depot ! That makes me feel a bit better about using them in the future . Thanks for mentioning this . <p> Another is , remember to keep shaking the can . For me it seems to build up pressure and the paint goes on smoother . Or maybe it 's just to hear that metal ball thing bounce around inside too .. hmmm .. issues ? ! ? <p> A tip for more colours to chose from is to find a place that sells spray paint to graffiti painters . They are made for outside use and should hold for furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I recently spray painted a dresser with water based spray paint . My comments on that arethe water based spray paints do have less fumes , but the paint is thinner and drips more easily . I thought it took longer to dry , but the finish is mirror smooth and a lot glossier , so if you want shiny , that 's a plus . The coverage was n't great , but it reminded me of really old furniture that has that super hard glossy finish , so it was n't all bad . I did n't think it was all that much easier to get off my hands , though . <p> I think I 'll stick with Rustoleum or Krylon ( I 've never had any problems with it ) . I actually found a really pretty aqua blue yesterday and ca n't wait to use it . <p> Just used the aqua blue Suzanne and it 's beautiful ! Love love love spray paint and when I found your blog a few months back I loved that you , too , were obsessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me more about the spray paint gunI had numb finger for days.an odd sensation . I , too , may invest in a nice sprayer for bigger projects since everything looks better with a touch of paint : ) <p> Has anyone used a spray gun ? Something like a Preval Spray Gun ? It let 's you turn any liquid into a spray . Maybe useful for when you need more color selection . I have n't tried one yet but would love to hear some reviews . <p> I am still in a deep depression that the American Heirloom color " Chenille " was discontinued.I went to every Home Depot in the area to buy all I could . ( It 's my heirloom white but a little creamier . ) Sigh <p> I 've truly come to LOVE spray paint as well . The " fastness " of it just ca n't be beat when you have 2 small children running around . I recently painted boring , cheapie , outdoor plastic chairs a wonderful " Martha green " and the transformation from cheap to chic was instantaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night and it 's scratched all to heck . I 'm out of the color so I have go get a spare can for such emergencies . Though likely I 'll just find more things to paint that fun color ! <p> Please , I love spray paint , too , but get one of those attachments that let you squeeze a lever to get the spray out , costs $5-6 at a hardware store . My finger is still numb weeks later after starting a project painting my outdoor light fixtures , originally PINK , to a metallic hammered brown . Looks great now , but if I would have known about the finger , I would have bought the lever before I ever started . I finished with it , but wish I had known about it before ! I have read of this numbness lasting as long as over a year , and trust me , it is annoying even to type ! <p> I am a spray paint addict . I will spray paint absolutely anything . I recently sprayed 2 dressers from my childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big girl room when her baby brother was born . My parents thought I was crazy to spray the wood . But they do admit , they look great . I modified the sides with some beadboard to match her bed . I used the Rustoleum Lacquer . Huge fan of it otherwise , but with this project I found it did n't  give the high gloss I was looking for . So I added Rustoleum Double Coverage Ultra Gloss . They look great ! A little tacky on top , so I may try your **26;880;TOOLONG brushing method next time . I too always strive for the hard gloss look . <p> I just ran across this post and your pros and cons , along with all of the responses , are really great . I have been having really bad headaches lately and have been spraying and painting a lot , so I think that may be the culprit . I plan on investing in one of those high powered masks this weekend . Good tip about lifting the paint drip with painters taper as well ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a glossy black spray paint and it looks like crap ! I did a lot of coats trying to get that shiny , even coverage . It never happened for me . NOW , i need to know the best way to get it off so I can try with a different type of paint . Any help ? ? P.S- I still love spray painting stuff , just not this dresser . <p> I love LOVE love spray paint , but I live in NYC and do n't  have a garage . So during the summer months I can spray on my roof ( lucky for me I am on the top floor and the only one with roof access ) , but in the winter months I cant really get on the roof and spray , especially when there is snow on the ground . I know your not supposed to , but I have spray painted some small things in my shower this winter . I am just curious what other NYers do when they live in buildings that do n't  have roof access at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time today ! I built and painted an entire table with brush paint a couple of months ago and it was grueling . I did n't  even think to consider spray paint until I read your post . I just transformed some Thrift Store and Dollar Store Frames for my living room . <p> I absolutely love using spray paint , but have also stuggled with the thought of how harmful it could be to the environment . Often this idea is quickly diffused by the new thought of my freshly painted bright baby blue . <p> I am a Scenic Artist by trade , meaning I paint scenery for theatres , and I use a lot of spray paint . I agree that sometimes a can of spray paint can be magical , but I always take great precaution when using it . The fumes are very toxic ( not to mention they smell terrible ! ) and I use a respirator , not just a mask . Most masks that people have are particle masks and do not help with harmful vapors . Check that your respirator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to wear gloves . The chemicals will also seep through your skin and into your bloodstream if they contact your hands . It does not burn or anything immediate , its just not a terribly healthy thing to have in your body . I say the fewer chemicals that we are exposed to , the better . But using some simple protections , I am a fan of the magical land of spray paint . Great blog , I 'm a new fan ! <p> This is a wonderful article . I am glad there is someone out there for give advices regarding spray paint . Just wanted to let everyone know about a new brand of spray paint " Bosny " that has recently appeared on the U.S. market . Nowadays , a lot of us are concerned with prices for any products we buy , Bosny is much cheaper than the products by Krylon , Valspar or Rust-Oleum . At the same time , Bosny paint has very good quality and has a lot of specialty paints and a large assortment of colors . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very stupid mistake of spraypainting a table indoors recently . Even though I opened all my windows , the air still filled with a strong ( not to mention toxic ) smell . And a strange white dust ended up all over the place , even in rooms I had n't  been painting in . Best part : finding spraypaint in my nostrils . I did it really stupidly for my first time . Next time I will for sure do it outdoors and wear a mask . No more messing around with the stuff indoors , the cleanup afterwards was a total pain . <p> I have a question about painting metal . I 've tried to paint two chandeliers now and while hanging them the chain seemed to scratch off the finish so easily ! Should I be priming or waiting for it to dry even longer ? <p> I 'm way late to this post . I got here clicking through some of your other great spray painting tutorials and tips . <p> I love spray paint and your tips are fantastic . I 'm just getting ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was great to be reminded about using several thin coats to avoid the drips ! <p> As an environmental scientist I have to say that spray paints are extremely bad for the environment . As a result I swore off using them , and have held that promise ever since about 8 or so years now . <p> You just changed my mind . <p> Now all I need is something to paint the question being where to start first <p> Great site and I am really loving your projects . I also love the DIY stuff . I have some brass door handles that DEFINITELY got ta go , so I would love to spray paint them the Oil Rubbed Bronze color . A couple of questions for you though do they ( or any metal piece ) need to be spray primed first , or just directly spray painted a few times ? . And can you recommend the best paint and primer ( if needed ) to use . I looked for the ORB color at Canadian tire yesterday , but did n't  find anywill keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read this part before I started spraying ! I had read your FAQs but missed this post . Damn nozzle my paint is splattering ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I will try the old pin trick to clean it but wondering if it can be saved or is a bad nozzle as good as dead ? <p> I know I am very late coming here , but in case it may help someone , I 'd like to leave a tip for cleaning up from oil point or spray paint or the resin from pine cones . Rather than use turpentines or other harsh chemicals , you can simply put some sort of fat on your hands crisco , butter , lard or even vegetable oil . You just smear a little on and wash your hands with your regular hand soap and it comes right off . Its sort of amazing . I used to do a lot of work with pine cones and would keep the paper that came off of butter sticks in the fridge to grab a few of when I went out to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough left on the paper taken off of cold butter to work with regular hand wipes . So very much healthier than using turpentine . <p> And you know that turpentine is toxic ( fatally so ) to cats to put on them if they get paint spilled on their fur , so now you know you can just use a little bit of oil or butter and work it in , then wash and rinse well and its all gone and cat is healthy ! ! <p> Spread the word ! Keep turpentine and chemicals off your skin , your children and your pets ! <p> This weekend , my daughter , MaryLou , and I were priming and silver spraypainting plastic animals . here 's the conversation Please do not take offense to the R word . ML : Can we spray inside ? We will look retarded to the neighbors , spraypainting toys ! Me : If you use spraypaint inside , you 'll BECOME retarded ! ML : Oh , then carry on . <p> Thanks so much for responding . I bought the Devon mirror and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because my walls are yellow and they bring out the frames golden hues . I 'm considering painting my walls your grayish color , or more practically , spray painting the frame a silverish hue . What do you think ? ( PS I 'm a veterinarian but if I could , I 'd start a second career of decorating/design ! ) 23102 @qwx883102

The choices are numerous from high end stone products that come from a quarry to wood and recycled materials to the budget friendly laminates . Laminate has gotten a bad rap for a lot of the products from the past decades , but times have changed . I 'm a fan of laminate countertops in kitchens for these five reasons . <p> 1 . Low Maintenance &amp; Easy to Clean . When we were growing up my mom had ceramic tile countertops and I remember her saying she could n't wait for the day to rip them out . I also remember her scrubbing ( and making us scrub ! ) the grout to keep it clean and bright . Laminate offers an easy to clean solution with a household cleaner , a sponge , and some hot water , cleaning them is a breeze and maintaining them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Budget Friendly . Compared to stone and other solid surface countertops , laminate wins in the price war . Starting as low as $15 per square foot , they are far more affordable than quartz , marble , or granite which are often $50 to $100 per square foot depending on the material . You do have to be careful of sharp objects , abrasive cleaners , or extremely high heat . Here is a brief and interesting read about how laminates are made . <p> 3 . Stylish . Laminate countertops are looking so good ! The new patterns complement dark and light , painted and wood cabinets , but do you notice how they 're installed ? <p> When ordering your laminate surface consider not including the laminate backsplash seen with many of the older versions ( that little lip or apron that rides up on the wall ) . <p> Instead opt for a countertop that stops at the edge of the horizontal plane and choose a pretty backsplash that meets the countertop at the bottom of the wall like so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way baby ! I 'm weighing these three choices for a future project and leaning toward the White Carrara among these marble lookalike samples . I like that they 're also are available in bullnose and ogee edges for a more contemporary look . <p> 5 . Magazine Worthy . It 's not just high end solid stone or wood countertops that make it into magazines now . Stone lookalike laminates are candidates too ! Our budget shelter kitchen remodel from last year was impressive enough to make the pages of the August issue of BH&amp;G 's Kitchen + Bath Makeovers , check it out in print , we 're so excited to see it featured ! <p> You may recall it was Wilsonart who donated the Perla Piazza countertops to this good cause and their generosity is so greatly appreciated . Those are my five reasons why you should consider choosing laminate for your kitchen , a great look at a smart price . <p> How many of you have chosen laminate in your kitchen ? Are you happy you did ? <p> *This post sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I agree ! Laminate has come a long way from what it used to be . We recently installed a new laminate counter top in our kitchen and I could n't be happier with it . I wanted something light and clean and of course , budget friendly , so we ended up with a style that cost less than $300 for a 12 ' length . Unfortunately , it does have the backsplash ( had to have it with the option we chose to order ) but it really does n't  bother me too much . Also , have you seen the affordable premade pieces available at Lowes and Home Depot ? Super cheap ! <p> Wow , what a great post . I sure hope the stigma for laminate goes away . I have a bad glued laminate sheet with tile edging and really wanted the new Formica marble look with the ogee edge , but we are in the process of making one section from reclaimed wood because I needed it to be basically free . Once we get our island reshaped , though I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look great . What great examples , and not doing the back splash makes a huge difference ! <p> I 'm loving the new look of laminate I do love solid surface but one thing that always scares me is how hard they are ; I set a glass bowl down a little too hard and I 'm afraid that granite is going to break it . I love that laminate has a little give to it . <p> We ordered the Calcutta Marble laminate ( pictured above ) for our new build . We did a lot of shopping around , but the more popular stuff just was n't in our price range . Also , well have three kids under the age of two in less than a month , and I need something easy to clean ! <p> The guy at our countertop store actually said something to me about the popularity of granite etc " Granite has been really gaining popularity for the last 5-10 years , and its gorgeous , but people think that just getting granite countertops sealed keeps them clean . I think in another 5-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold issues in kitchens with these countertops , because people are n't  cleaning them properly . " He said that even with the sealants , a lot of stuff can still sneak through . <p> We went cheap when deciding on what finishes to put in our new build . We figured we would skip the builders marked up prices and put in what we want over the next few years as our budget allowed . I thought the first thing I would want to rip out would be those laminate countertops in both our kitchen and bathrooms , but its been so easy to clean that I 'm keeping it around until my kids are a little older . I love that I do n't  have to even think about the countertops at this point . <p> My only regret is not getting the laminate flush to the wall like in your examples . I wish I had known that was an option ! That ugly lip is keeping me from installing my backsplash because I do n't  want to have gap at the bottom of the wall when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about laminate in a while . I guess I did n't  realize it was making a comeback and the options have gotten better . We have ghetto old school laminate in our kitchen currently . Its not pretty . Were looking to remodel probably next year and having laminate as a possible low cost solution is awesome Thanks for sharing ! <p> The whole time I was reading this I was thinking , " I LOVE OUR WILSONART HD COUNTERTOPS ! " They look amazing and are no maintenance . We spent $700 on ours ( we have a LOT of counters . ) I can only imagine how prohibitively expensive granite would have been . <p> My only word of caution is about the beveled edge option . Since its basically separate pieces of laminate glued on to create that edge ( as opposed to a solid piece that would be " carved " into that shape ) , we are noticing some tiny chips and wear at the places where the pieces meet . I wish we would have gone for the bullnose edge . <p> We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is so realistic looking that you would think you have granite . There are so many patterns to choose from . We did buy it with the attached backsplash and then added a coordinating tile backsplash up to the bottom of the upper cabinets . We will be moving soon , and if the next house we buy and remodel needs countertops , we will use likely buy the HD laminate again . However , we might consider eliminating the attached backsplash and strictly go with the tile backsplash . However , we do like for now how it turned out . <p> Due to budget constraints I had laminate installed in a new build . I chose the Wilsonart White Carrara with my white cabinets and I love it . I heard that there have been problems with the new edges so I went with the standard edge . All that is needed is a splashy backsplash . Great post . I hope the stigma goes away ! <p> Love this post . I do n't  understand all the laminate hate out there . Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens ? We installed Wilsonart laminate in our kitchen 10 years ago and they have held up perfectly and still look great . We chose Graphite Nebula , a deep charcoal grey , almost black . We opted for the standard edge , clean and squared , which I think looks less characteristically laminate as compared to a curved or beveled edge . We did n't  install the little backsplash ledge and instead brought our white subway tile backsplash right down to the countertop and neatly caulked the seam . From a distance our counters look a little like soapstone . No regrets here . <p> I chose laminate countertops from Ikea when I remodelled my kitchen . I think they look totally contemporary and at a price point that just ca n't be beat . I like the clean edge and that there is no backsplash on them . A word of caution , the Ikea laminate countertops are thicker than other laminate counters , be sure to factor that in when buying faucets ; mine just barely made it to the downpipe . Oops . <p> We had old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new house . The difference in price between stone and good formica was not very big on the mortgage time-scale , plus we would have to get integrated sink with formica which I did not like . So we got granit . What a pain to clean ! It absorbs grease like a sponge and after two years we have darker areas where the grease from stove splashed and greasy spoons were left My friends say its barely noticeable , but I KNOW its there and I CAN see it . So yes , you are right , laminate is better . At least I got vinyl floor , which is so much easier to clean than tile ! : ) <p> I have 17 year old off white laminate that has held up extremely well . I clean houses for a living and granite shows hard water spots and loses its shine . When I replace I 'm going with laminate again . I love all the new colors and the back splash . <p> I 'm so glad I 'm not the only one who appreciates laminate countertops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backsplash changes the look for the better . I had never thought about it , but what a difference ! I wonder if the splash can just be cut off of those prefab countertop pieces at Home Depot to achieve the same look ? <p> What a timely post ! We just had our new Wilsonart HD laminate countertops installed last week , and I truly couldnt be happier with them . I chose the Carrara Santorini because I liked the grey veining more than the subtle Calcutta Marble . Just like you said , I opted to not add the backsplash and just had my white subway tile put in today . I 've already had people shocked to find out that its not real marble . The rounded edge gives the illusion of marble , and then you only have the one seam along the side . I 'm so happy with it ! <p> Twenty years and counting with my laminate countertops ! Yes there are a couple of slice marks in it but twenty years , 4 kids and a hubby , I would n't use anything else on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( my hubby has it on his office desk top ) <p> We chose laminate when we renovated our kitchen and I never regretted it . The countertop looks expensive and requires zero maintenance . We actually chose to keep the " lip " backsplash that came with the countertop and I personally feel it actually ads to the look . <p> When we did a kitchen remodel a few years ago , we put in a beautiful Peacock Green ( almost black ) granite . Biggest mistake EVER ! It is such a pain in the butt to clean ! You cant just swipe it with a sponge because it looks terrible unless you also dry it . Its like trying to clean a mirror with a wet sponge.streaks galore . Mine are " factory " sealed which is a plus , but you need to use a special granite cleaner , and wipe them dry . I hate them ! and they were SO expensive ! <p> Wow , this article couldnt of come at a better time for me . We just finished ripping out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total gut on the main floor of our old farm house . I did n't  know you could have laminate w/o the rolled up back . You have just added $$$ to my budget ! Thank you so very much . Its getting harder and harder to find ways to cut things off the want list . <p> My husband and I remodeled our kitchen about three years ago and went with laminate . We have a lot of counter space , so even with the laminate it was 1600.00 ! We chose a medium soapstone and used marble subway tile for the backsplash . It looks great and its easy to live with . No regrets at all ! <p> Another anti-granite post here . Thankfully we did n't  pay for ours they were already in the home we purchased . When the time comes to do so , I will happily rip them out and replace them with something more functional . I am really excited to see how far laminate has come . <p> Our kitchen is gutted to the studs as I type . Were DIYing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the weekends when the hubs is off work . Were on week 8 . With three kids . Kill me now . The point of my mini novel is , our counters are payed for and we went with the Wilsonart White Carrera , no backsplash . I 'm so excited to see them installed , I could pee myself . If you 're so inclined , I do an update of where were at once a week , and you can see our progress here : LONG ... <p> This post could not be more perfect timing ! I just discovered on local blogs/Pinterest Formica fx Calcutta Marble ! i was blown away by the pics on LONG ... That this was Formica ! As soon as I read this article I ran to my closest Home Depot to sadly find only a sample in a 2+2 inch sample chip . Do you know where they feature this in a showroom Or larger scale sample ? I also am confused about comments above with the edging options . What is the difference between bullnose and ogee edge ? Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullnose edging having issues . <p> We put in beautiful laminate countertops in our kitchen with an integrated sink . The are beautiful and no maintenance . I 'm too busy to worry about taking care of an item in my kitchen that serves so many purposes . The only thing I wish is that I 'd have chosen not to have the backsplash and tiled . New countertops and flooring were achieved in that renovation and I have never felt like my choices were anything less than wonderful . I just put new Wilsonart countertops and sinks in my two bathrooms and they are truly spectacular . One bathroom has a backsplash the other does not and is tiled . I am very pleased with the look of both . I feel I can change out my countertops a little more often when I have n't spent a fortune . I like that . <p> We had builders grade laminate in our last home . It must have been the cheapest of the cheap because under the edge was exposed particle board and around the edges , especially over the dishwasher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also chipped off on some of the edges leaving that particle stuff exposed . I swore I 'd never use it again but you have changed my mind . I am currently buying a 100 year old house and need to remodel the kitchen which was updated , probably in the 80s . I think the new laminate is the way to go . Have you heard of the particle board problem before ? and how is that issue addressed now ? Thanks for a great post ! <p> When we had our kitchen done a few years ago I was n't too keen on the idea of laminate . However , after reluctantly going along with it I now LOVE it . Very low maintenance and budget friendly couldnt agree more . <p> I agree ! We installed granite countertops in our last house just before we put it on the market to sell . I 'm so glad we were able to try it out before building our new home . My husband and I broke 3 glasses in a short period of time setting them down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really surprising . Between that and the fear of acidic foods , maintenance , etc , told us quickly that we were not granite people . And , I think I may be one of the few people on earth who did n't  yearn for it anyway . I like it fine in many other traditional look kitchens , but for me , the pattern always felt overpowering . Still , I felt like I had to apologize for preferring laminate . People looked at me like I must not have good taste . : -D <p> I love laminate . We have it in the kitchen and soon in all four baths . So easy to keep clean and tidy . We have some kind of faux stone in all the baths , and that stuff is a major , major pain to keep up . Ca n't stand it ! <p> We put in new counters almost 2 years ago and went with a recycled glass/quartz/granite combo . We love the look of it , but in hindsight , I wish we would have spent the money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really hate my cabinets and no matter how I paint them , they 're still 1971 cabinets . We spent almost $5k on the counters , so ripping them out and starting over is not an option . Well likely put new doors on the cabinets in the near future . That might help <p> We got laminate in our last kitchen because of cost and easy care , plus not breaking things dropped on it ( we have young kids ) . However , you can easily spend a lot on laminate once you go beyond the cheapest ones , so you need to be aware of that . <p> We had issues with not having flat walls , and the installer does n't  scribe the edges the way they do with solid surfaces , so while we lived with a gap between counter and wall we installed the 2 inch thing when we sold the house . <p> We did n't  realise that because we had dark counters ( oiled soapstone ) youd see the white at the very base of the laminate along each seam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do a curved or ogee edge . Definitely try to find an installed sample to look at before you order . <p> Oh , while you 're talking about materials I 'd love to see a roundup of soft kitchen floor coverings . Our house is 90 years old and the wooden floors would be impossible to match ( mostly because of the gaps ! ) , plus I like the softness of a vinyl floor on my feet . Are vinyl and cork the only options ? How do the various options look hard up against hardwoods of a different colour ? Are there low VOC vinyl alternatives ? <p> I used to have ceramic tile counters and I hated them ! We had a water leak and had to redo our kitchen . I chose laminate and we save enough cash to get new floors for my dining room ! I 'm showing this post to my hubby who is skeptical about the laminate . <p> My 28 year old house has laminate counter tops and they have held up well . Were currently giving the kitchen a freshening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited all these years for a nicer kitchen and desperately want an undermounted sink . I think the solid surface has the benefit of being easy to clean , easy to repair and for me the most important , undermounted sink . We are n't  planning on moving in the next 10 years so I 'm not worried about resale value any thing I pick will be the dreaded " dated " by the time we sell . <p> When we purchased our 1910 home , somewhere along the line , someone decided to do , not one , but Two layers of ( ugly ) tile for the countertops . So we ripped it all out , and being on a tight , tight budget , headed to home depot to see what we could find , and we found a great laminate top that has a black and brown granite look to it . It mainly looks black , which matched perfectly . It cost us about $300 to redo our countertops . We ended up purchasing the one with the backsplash ( that 's all they had ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfully ) Everyone that sees it likes our granite tops , and are impressed when we tell them its laminate = ) <p> We have 1966 Laminate now , and I do n't  want that again . : P But granite , marble or any other natural stones have been out of the question ever since I read about how fragile they are . Depending on time and budget , I might consider laminate or manmande stone . Well see when we get there . <p> Thank you for this post . I have a BA in Interior Design and get irritated with the fad of granite , especially for people that I *know* will not seal it as they are supposed to . I think laminate is a great , cost effective way to go . <p> Great timing ! I put a bid on a house yesterday and know I 'll have to replace the kitchen right away ( wish me luck ! ) . My Realtor told me not to put laminate in , but I " m not worried about resale and I keep thinking of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beluga . I love this kitchen , its practical for a family , and I will probably shamelessly copy as much as I can : LONG ... <p> I whole-heartedly agree with your reaons on laminate . I remodeled my kitchen a few years back and chose laminate because in my neighborhood , spending the $$$ on granite would NOT fetch a higher price . ( I am in a middle class nidhgborhood . ) Also I know I 'd want to change down the road and wouldnt because I 'd feel guilty for the money I spent on granite . And as for that backsplash , I let someone talk me into getting it . What a mistake ! a ) It cost me more for that , and b ) something extra to clean ! Also I like bull nose edge or curved corners . Its softer and kitchens have a lot of hard edges . <p> Dear Kate- Im thrilled that you tackled the subject of Laminate for counters ! ! ! I 'm ready to redo my counter and it is a horrible brown checked " THING " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and I want it to be perfect . Of course money is a factor , but the Wilsonart is really , really , good looking . Would you be so kind as to let me know what was the name of the Wilsonart in the three pics that you used ? I tried to click on them , hoping they would tell me , but it wo n't . Also yours look wonderful ! Were you afraid to pick such a light color ? THANKS- Catherine <p> New butcher block laminate ! My sample arrived in todays mail so I was very excited to see this post . The laminate is Wilsonart Premium Laminate that looks like butcher block . Its a new product for Fall 2013 . I got a sample of the dark brown ( Old Oak Mill ) and they also have a lighter color . Its fantastic looking ! The thought of a no-maintenance butcher block look-alike is very exciting . <p> Yes , Laminate has come a long way . I used it in my laundry room and love it . I wonder if homeowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that look ? Then they could put a nice tiled backsplash . I guess someone who is thinking of replacing it could try it and see if it works : ) <p> Hi Stephanie , I 'm curious to know if that can be done too , I suspect it might be a huge mess and leave a larger gap than can be covered by tile , usually those aprons are an inch thick as I recall , but if anyones done it successfully , I 'd love to know ! <p> Laminate is the way to go . It comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns . Its the most inexpensive material available . When you get tired of a pattern , you can change it without breaking the bank . <p> My husband predicts a day all the landfills have granite that people are tired of . He says you 'll be able to walk into any house with granite countertops and say , " This is to two thousand teens . " <p> The only thing I do n't  really like about laminate is that you cant use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks in your photos above look like they are level with the countertop . How is that done ? <p> I 've lived with almost every type of countertop : Tile , limestone , granite , Corian , laminate , even contact paper ( seriously ! ) . All have pluses and minuses . My least favorite besides the contact paper was the tile , and my most favorite was actually some vintage Formica with gold glitter in it ! That stuff was amazing . Right now we have granite and Ive broken so many dishes . We did less expensive cabinets and more expensive countertops during our remodel a few years ago but if I had to do it again I 'd go with laminate counters and better cabinetry . Live and learn ! <p> Hi I too love laminate , but I live in an area where our drinking water has a lot of minerals . We installed white Wilsonart laminate in our bathroom and there is a constant mineral stain around the faucet handles . If you bleach it , it gets worse . Do not bleach your laminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry cleaner or CLR ( Calcium Lime and Rust ) product . If anyone else has problems with hard water , please do n't  get white laminate ! If anyone had a solution to remove the yellowed mineral stains , please reply . <p> When we moved into our teeny 1940s house , we inherited solid-but-sad wood cabinets and a countertop made out of plywood covered with contact paper . Eek ! A few coats of cream paint made the cabinets look great , and we were able to find a prefab laminate countertop at our local home store for less than $150 . We briefly debated going with a different material , but it would be foolish to chose natural stone in our neighborhood ( we 'd never recoup the money if we sell ) . Our laminate countertops were really budget-friendly , and they 're tough , easy to clean , and look great . Love them ! We saved so much money on the cabinets and counters that we were able to redo the flooring and tile our backsplash . For less than $500 , we have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little house , and is really practical . I couldnt be happier . <p> For an even better look , omit the backsplash and get a " D " edge doubled . A regular D edge is about 1 ? deep so by doubling it you will have a substantial 2 ? lip on the front of your counter . Balances the height of base cupboards and , if you 're using a stone/granite laminate look-alike it mimics the look even better . <p> A few people have posted asking if they can just cut off the backsplash on the preform purchased , stocked laminate tops from HD and Lowes . The answer is no and here is why : if from the back edge of the backsplash to the front is 1 piece of laminate . If you cut the backsplash off from the top , you are left with a chunk of your counter not covered by the laminate ( and probably do n't  have a pretty line either ) . If you cut off the backsplash running the blade parallel to the backsplash , the counter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely would n't even meet the front of your cabinet . If you do n't  want the backsplash , custom order without it . <p> I like reading blogs about renovation on a budget ! And the photos of this post of laminate countertops in the kitchen are amazing ! <p> I got a few questions about laminate countertops in the bathroom countertops though . My small kitchen has Italian porcelain tiles we installed few years back and I love how it looks and its so easy to maintain . However , my bathrooms have cultured marble countertops with undermount sinks . There are black waters pots on the countertops , and " orangey " circles around where the old faucets were ( we changed the faucets ) , also the sink in one of the bathroom sinks is all scratched and stained and I simply cant keep it clean . : ( <p> Now I have a baby , I do n't  think I can do any tile countertops without help . But I 'm on a budget , so I am thinking if its possible to install laminate countertops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know the durability of laminate countertops in bathrooms ( havent had it in bathrooms before ) and if its impossible as a DIY project . <p> Anyone has any insight on this ? I really cant spend that much money on these countertops and sinks and therere 3 ( 36 ? , 60 ? and 72 ? ) . I am just so tired of " trying " to clean up without success . Hope someone can help . ANY ideas are welcome ! Thanks for reading ! <p> A few years later &amp; I just found this and am so glad . In process of buying a a cool vintage 80s house with an old kitchen and crooked brown , tile countertops . Have been debating doing feather lite concrete over them but a great laminate sounds like a much happier option . Glad I found this post ! <p> I know this is long after your original post , but love the laminate featured in the second picture in your article ( white cabinets and teapot on store , bowl on counter ) . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking everywhere for something like this but have not see this . Thanks ! <p> I briefly browsed through the comments and did n't  see this question . If its already been asked , I do apologize ! <p> The countertop looks fabulous . Was this laminate built on a substrate with the typical , standard measurements ? It actually looks a little bit thinner than normal which I prefer . Ive run across this before and would love to know whether you customized yours by asking for a thinner substrate . Using a thinner substrate tends to help laminate counters not " scream laminate . " Three centimeters ( a bit thinner than standard ) achieves more of a stone-like thickness and just plays a trick on the eye by not looking like EVERY single laminate countertop that youve ever seen before ! We are about to install WilsonArt laminate with no backsplash . And although I know that we want it built on a thinner substrate , I 'm having a hard time finding an installer who knows anything about this . So I would lovvvvve to hear your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , thank you ! <p> I am remodeling my kitchen right now and looking for counter top solutions . I had n't  even considered laminate counter tops because I have always like the look of granite kitchen counter tops . But it looks like they have similar looks depending on the pattern . I think that it is good to look at the different options that are available for remodeling purposes . <p> What a great post ! We need to replace our laminate countertops that are 16 years old and installed when we built our house . They were all we could afford . My husband wants granite or ceramic and I want to stick with the laminate . They have held up well , so why change . I think I have just stumbled upon my argument ! Thanks ! <p> We sold our house this past July . It was 17 years old , and still had its original white laminate counters . They were in excellent shape and I 'm NOT easy on stuff . Thay house sold in 3 hours and had two offers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in Formica counters that look like granite with an ogee edge in the kitchen . The bathrooms have granite in a tan color with speckles . I hate it . It already has darkened areas from water . And its so cold and hard ! We decided to add a peninsula to our kitchen , and got the same Formica that was already here . I love it . I am sick of all the snobs who only want granite . They can keep it . My dream counters would be sparkly quartz , but if I cant have that l will stick with laminate . Its so easy to take care of . And even though I do n't  try to pass it off as granite , a relative was here for Christmas , and she actually sat at the counter and touched it and asked how they matched my beautiful granite when they added the peninsula . I did n't  want her to feel stupid so I did n't  say anything . She lives in a huge , expensive house that does have granite , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were up to me I 'd live in a house with a 50s kitchen and boomerang counters with the metal edge ! I love laminate and I 'm not ashamed ! <p> Laminate countertops are getting much closer to a high end countertop , but for our clients we still install granite or quartz with most of the kitchens and bathrooms that we renovate . I will say that I have seen a couple that are very sharp looking counters ! Great article ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057677 @3257677/ <h> Hardwood v. Lookalike Tile <p> By Kate Riley July 9 , 2013 <p> Question friends , what do you think of all the wood lookalike tile that 's available to homeowners now ? As much as I adore and I mean adore true hardwood , I 'm drawn to the idea of a lookalike tile products that are now available from several sources . <p> Lookalike wood tile caught my eye last year in a restaurant in Canada and I thought it was so cool I got down on my knees to caress that floor , no joke . I 've seen it installed in restaurants in the Bay Area too which makes sense since it looks like reclaimed or hand scraped wood but has the benefit of repelling moisture while maintaining a great look , even with tons of traffic . <p> Tile is cold and hard underfoot which is fine by me in summer but in winter not so much , so radiant heat is definitely a consideration ( and additional expense ) . I love the fact that up close it looks pretty amazing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tile looks so much like the real thing . <p> The idea of a surface that will take the wear and tear of foot traffic , pets , and kids has a lot of appeal . But there 's always that lingering question of how it will affect resale value and whether the product will stand the test of time . <p> I just put on an addition , I priced both options out . I was surprised how expensive the nice ( like in your photos ) wood grain tile is . And my installer balked at really tight grout lines , you have to have a perfectly level floor or install a perfectly level subfloor ( more$$ ) I love the tile look , but ultimately decide on hardwood . I live in the Midwest so hardwood floors are practical , not too expensive and desirable for resale <p> I 've had it in my bathroom for 10 years because I wanted the wood look without the worry of moisture , etc. and it is the best thing ever ! It looks the same as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grout that matched the color of the wood tile so it would stand out . I am now planning on doing my entire 1st floor including kitchen , living room , etc. because I do n't  want to worry about cleaning it and scratches . I can bleach and not worry . Even debating about radiant floor heating but might not do it due to cost and will do an area rug instead that has built in heating . <p> I remember the first time I saw it in person , I thought it was wood and had to bend down and tap on it to realize it was tile . I think it is a great look and very practical . It might be a great expense up front , but it would not have to be replaced or refinished , no scratches either . I like it ! <p> Initially I was very drawn to the wood look tile . They are surprisingly authentic looking and come in some wonderful shades of weathered wood , which I love . But the thought that keeps nagging at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is tile that is made to look like something else . I 'm weird that way , I want things to be authentic , REAL , in their original formetc . Anything else just feels like a cheap copy to me , even if it looks good and is n't cheap . I too am curious if it will stand the test of time or if it will be " out " in a couple of years . <p> We have real hardwood on our first floor but just installed faux wood upstairs in our master bath . I really love it . It looks beautiful and is really practical in this application . In general , I 'm a fan of real wood where practical , but the faux is a great option . You can see the tile here : LONG ... <p> Oh my gosh , Kate ! I cant believe you posted about this . This is EXACTLY what my husband and I have been talking about doing throughout most of our downstairs ( kitchen , entry , bath ) . I was n't sure if it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell within a couple of years . I truly admire your taste , so this just confirms our decision ! ! Yay ! ; ) <p> After putting wood flooring in our house about 5 years ago we have come to find out it was a mistake . We have pets and kids and they have destroyed the wood . We were told when we purchased it that it could be refinished.only to find recently that it can not . We have pretty much decided that we are going to rip up the wood and use the wood look tile . It will last with kids and pets and we wont have to baby it . Although the wood is ( well was ) beautiful its just to practical long term for our active family . <p> I can see the practicality for places like bathrooms , kitchens or basements where someone wants a wood look but moisture or other durability issues are a problem . But personally , I would n't want it . I do n't  mind tile that looks like stone but this is a little too faux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hubby works in the custom kitchen business and they are opening a new showroom . They put the wood look tile throughout and it looks stunning ! ! It will be so much easier to maintain with lots of traffic coming through . I wanted to do it in my bathrooms &amp; kitchen but was n't sure how to do it . We want to put real hardwood in the living room and halls but could you do both ? How should it meet up ? ? We just are n't  sure what to do . <p> My sister installed faux wood tile in their entryway , dining room , kitchen and down the halls . It looks amazing . They have 2 boys and 2 bulldogs so its great for them . I do n't  think it looks weird at all . I love it ! <p> I like this product , a lot . I 've seen in it several applications and colorways and it always looks good . I think if you go with traditional planks , the product will have more staying powerthe shapely tiles , not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on everywhere I go read " this is timeless , classic and will never look dated " or , " is this a trend , how soon will this be dated ? " Really , everything looks dated eventually . Hardwoods are classic but color preferences change . Classic furniture gets freshen with on-trend upholstery . Classic tiles get produced , combined in new colorsI think you choose what you love and know that in a few years , you 'll freshen up or replace . That 's what gives life to decorating ! Can you image that for the next 25 years , people living in white and marble kitchens will feel no need to reno because their design is " classic " doubtful : ) <p> My husband &amp; I are contemplating flooring options right now as well . I think for me , it comes down to where you live &amp; what type of house you have . We live in the Midwest , so we have very cold winters . Also , our house is a 1905 Foursquare . These two things make me strongly lean away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely go with a hardwood or engineered hardwood flooring . It just seems like the house will benefit from a more authentic look . Overall , I do n't  think you can ever go wrong with a wood look for flooring , so do what you think will best suit your climate &amp; house style ! <p> Love hearing all the opinions on this . A house we were interested in two house hunts ago had faux bamboo porcelain tile and hardwood and we just loved it . The bamboo-look tiles come in a variety of grey tones , so they look like a stained wood but you can tell its a little too perfect to be wood . Its a very interesting look and what we plan to go with when we remodel our kitchen and replace the floors in our entryway . Sleek and modern without feeling cold . Google " porcelain bamboo tile " to see it . <p> Although I think Ceramic Hardwood tile has its place , I think it will go the way of laminate hardwood products out the door ! Anything made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastest . What about using slate flooring in your mud room or high traffic hallway ? A natural durable stone , that is always a classic choice . ( The dark charcoal gray color slate , not multi-colored slate of the 70s . ) <p> I am loving the wood-look tiles . My brother and sister-in-law are in the middle of a kitchen remodel and are using these . I cant wait to see them in action ! We have a powder room I 'd like to make over soon and I 've been eyeing those tiles . They are a bit pricey , but I would be willing to splurge there : ) <p> I work as a commercial interior designer and it seems like every rep that comes in is adding more and more wood ceramic tile looks to their line to keep up with the growing demand . I find that the ceramic tile is too stiff and cold it is very visually appealing but does n't  feel like wood underfoot . I would recommend considering a vinyl wood look plank . This is not your mothers Pergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a peel and stick ( to each other ) floating product that we have used in on-campus apartments for work . <p> I am so glad you addressed this topic as I too have questions ! The wood floors in my kitchen/entry/hall have not worn well at all . The faux wood tile would seem to give me the look I want without the upkeep . I am over the whole traditionalist mentality and " faux " does n't  really bother me and I am not planning to sell my house so I am the one who has to live with it . Will I walk into my kitchen and wonder why I followed a passing fad that was expensive and I ca n't change like wall color ? Looking forward to hearing what others think . <p> We installed it in our basement and now I 'm wondering why we did n't  do it in our kitchen/dining area , as well . We were able to get a tile wood look a like the same tone as our wood floor , so its seemless . My MIL did n't  believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> We use small spacers . I wished we had either gotten smaller spacers or find a way to use no spacers ( not sure how that works with tile ) . Also , we thought the grout was a perfect match when looking at the color on the box . However we discovered grout dries lighter . So if you want to minimize the grout lines , go darker than you think . <p> My parents just installed it ( they live in So . Cal. ) and they love it . Two things were important for them in their decision making : they have big dogs , so it has to be durable and they have to be able to maintain the floor easily . The idea of being able to use a steam mop to keep it clean is the most appealing thing to me . I cant wait to see how it looks ! <p> We 've used the faux ceramic tile ( that 's made of the same stuff as the wood grain ) in a laundry room , just to see ( and because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to laying regular tile ) . That product has worked very well and I do n't  think you 'd know it was n't tile . But , its my laundry room so I 'm not that sensitive about it . We did do grout lines . <p> I 've seen the faux wood in restaurants and it does look fabulous . My contractor turned his nose up a little when I mentioned it but my money is on it sticking around ( so to speak ! ) . I have an all tile house now ( real tile ) and I have to say I miss the softness of the hardwood for my feet . Not sure you 'd get that softness with the new stuff . Maybe try it somewhere smaller like a laundry room before you go " whole hog " ? <p> I 've got ta say , I 've been pretty impressed with how these tiles have evolved over time many options look pretty darn close to real wood ! Although I prefer real wood in our general living space ( living rooms , bedrooms ) I do intend to use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since those areas are more prone to getting moist . <p> I installed ceramic wood tile in a previous home . Kitchen and family room . This was an addition and remodel and it was laid on concrete slab . This was about 8 years ago and at that time price-wise the engineered laminate still looked cheap and actual hardwoods in the kitchen were not in vogue yet . Plus we entertain and I cook a lot . The wipe up of water in the kitchen every ten seconds were not appealing . I live in Texas and found the floor cooler in the summer and had no winter problems at all . We just got used to slippers and still did not find it too cold in bare feet . Plus we had new windows and insulation so even with a couple of serious winter events of snow and ice I never felt like the floor was keeping the house cool . We sold that house in two weeks and I was in it again two years ago and those floors are still there and look great and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look tile in the master bedroom , great room/dining area following water damage . I was looking for an excuse to get rid of the carpet and did not want to take care of hardwood . I was not happy with the contractor recommended by our insurance company . The installation could have been better . That said , I love the look and it is so easy to care for . Here is a link for a blog post I did regarding the wood look tile . **43;908;TOOLONG <p> I am not a current practicing designer but have my bachelors in design and stopped working to raise 4 kids and I was taught and developed quite an option about things that are trying to be something that they are not . I believe that you can come up with a great design using materials that are true to themselves that being said I LOVE this product . I would however embrace that fact that it is tile and let it we so I love that you know that it is tile but has such warmth with the color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that it is modern and fab ! <p> I look forward to reading everyones thoughts about this as my husband and I are currently weighing these two options for our home right now . <p> It seems a no brainer to me- most people would n't ever realize it was n't real wood unless they touched it , it has much higher durability and less maintenance , and in some cases it is half the price of wood floors ! <p> Ive been scouting out local hardware stores and there are some really beautiful options for wood tile , some that even have hand scraped texture ! <p> I had faux wood porcelain tile installed in my bathroom in January . I love it so much , its dreamy to look at and not cold to the touch the way ceramic is . Wouldnt hesitate to put it elsewhere in my home especially my kitchen that 's next on the list . But for now , back to preparing my hallway parquet for its re-sanding/varnishing .. Any tips Kate ? ? ! ! : ) <p> We just installed the wood-look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen about 500 sq feet and it looks amazing ! We replaced 12+12 ceramic tile with 6+24 planks set in a random wood floor style with the 1/16 ? grout lines and it looks incredible . I highly recommend it ! This past weekend my husband was replacing the dishwasher inlet valve , when he turned the water back on it popped off and flooded the kitchen floor . All I can say is I 'm so glad I did n't  put down new hardwood ! ! ! We just cleaned it up with our wet vac and all is well ! <p> That is exactly why Im drawn to it too Patty , we have real hardwood in our kitchen and while it looks great , that is the reality water damage . We once had our dishwasher do the same thing and I went through a dozen bath towels to mop up as quickly as possible but if it had sat any longer , would have ruined the wood . <p> I work in a hospital and they have started laying the hardwood tile in rooms . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than cold , white tile but I do n't  think I would want to see it in my home . I 'm sure some of the reason is because I see it for 12 hours and equate it with sickness and death . <p> I like it . I really do . We are moving to one of those tile-only areas and I think it would look amazing But then I think about faux wood laminate countertops , faux wood car paneling , and wood paneled basements . Yeah , it might look amazing now , but I doubt it will stand the test of time . That said , I love the look of the herringbone pattern you showed above . <p> That Moroccan pattern is to die for ! I 'm also in-love with that herringbone pattern right now , its so chic . I think I could go for the faux wood in a kitchen or bathroom where water damage would be a concern , the rest of the house I 'm on the fence about . Maybe its just the thought of having fake wood that 's hanging me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to consider it if the quality felt similar to that of hard wood . <p> I have it throughout my entire downstairs and I absolutely love it ! The dirtier the grout gets , the better it looks since the darker grout just makes it blend more with the dark wood tile . Wood is n't an option for us with a new puppy , three boys and a pool . I also like that my open floorplan does n't  look choppy with more than one flooring . I live in a hot climate so I love the coolness of tile . I would go with radiant heat if I lived someone cooler though . I cant think of any drawbacks . I suppose if I lived in a historic home it would not feel authentic , but in a new home I do n't  see the problem . <p> I guess I 'm on the " its nice , but its not the real thing " team . The pros would be durability certainly , but I think I would miss the " patina " that comes with hardwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens and bathrooms but not other rooms . I would recommend it for commercial applications however . <p> I am a HUGE fan of this product although I have never used it in my house . I think it is a great alternative , especially for laundry rooms and bathrooms ! Oh and to have it throughout the house with radiant heat is just a dream come true ! <p> I 'm from New England , so I put hardwood in my newly built house in the Southwest . Big mistake ! Here in the Southwest , tile is the way to go , but I just do n't  like the look of it in a formal living area . This is the perfect compromise . I imagine itd e good for any house , though , that has kids and pets ! Thanks for the sources . <p> We hard the all original hardwoods in our entire house , but recently while rebuilding our home and adding on an indoor laundry room we decided to go with wood look tile for the space . Our new laundry room also doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little mudroom area and also entry point into our home and exit to our backyard . <p> We moved back in our home a few weeks ago and I 'm so happy we went with tile for that area ! So happy , you can see images on my blog of the space . <p> As for an entire house in wood look tileI think it would depend on the climate &amp; lots of foot traffic etc . <p> We bought a house with this type of tile in the entry and kitchen . I love it in those places , but probably would not use it in others ( possible exception : a family room and bathroom ) because though it is pretty great-looking , it still lacks some of the warmth of real wood . I also would lay it in a more interesting way ; ours is laid in a typical tile pattern and so you are more aware that it is tile . I love the herringbone example in your post , for example , and the minimal grout lines . Bottom line ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option , I think . <p> I plan on installing the wood-look tile in the next house we buy ( other than the bedrooms my husband insists on carpet for bedrooms ) . Our current house is mostly tile floors and Ive gotten used to it and like how practical it is . I really do love actual hardwoods , but we have two crazy dogs and are about to have a little one , so I feel like tile is really the way to go ! In regards to how cold tile can be just wear some warm socks ! <p> CT above recommended Armstrongs vinyl wood planks . We 've had mixed results with this . Because the overlaps are sticky , you can reposition if you make a mistake ( although the adhesive is very strong ) , but it is a bit tricky to keep from getting gaps . Its a floating floor , so if you want to get rid of the whole thing in the future , its easy to pull up . Its good to use over surfaces that are not level , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily than I thought it would , but I do have a lot of rough boys . You cant do anything about damage since it ca n't be refinished . Theoretically you are supposed to be able to take up damaged planks and replace them , but did I mention the adhesive is very strong ? The darker colors especially show up scratches since the underlying material is white . It looks great for months ( no one could tell it was n't real wood at first , even a building contractor ) , but then dulls quickly . It was an affordable option for us at the time , but we eventually plan to replace it with real hardwood . We would n't do tile because it would be too cold in our mountain climate . Our slate bathrooms are bad enough . <p> My in-laws did the ceramic tile wood tiles in a pickled look some years ago . They had the 2 boys , several dogs running around , firewood dropped in front of 2 fireplaces and they love it . It is grouted very close together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedrooms and bathrooms but I never heard it until later . I did Armstrong Laminate 12mm , I think it was exotic walnut . This floor did not hold up well and at this was just me ( middle-aged woman ) and one small dog and one cat . I had to keep several wood shades of brown crayons for chip repairs . Very annoying . <p> I fell in love with this product several years ago when I first laid my eyes upon it . When we bought our current home 2.5 years ago , it was in the back of my mind to use it eventually . I have a question , however . My husband is n't a fan of painted furniture or cabinetry , unfortunately . Therefore there will be no painted cabinetry in my kitchens future . Would this product be too much " wood " with stained cabinetry ? <p> I love the look of it for a room that needs the practicality of it , like a bathroom or a mudroom . I do n't  think I would love it as much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat would probably make a big difference in swaying my opinion AND if there were no grout lines to try and keep clean . <p> I currently have 38 boxes of " wood " tile in my basement , waiting to be installed ! Hardwood floors are n't  very practical in a basement , so wood tile seemed to be just the ticket . I cant wait to see how they turn out I think its going to look amazing ! <p> I see the benefits in certain rooms and if alot of pets . Yet , I still think going from the Faux Hardwood tile to real wood would be odd . I did see tile wood once in person . I thought it was wood , then realized it was tile and thought " interesting but odd " . So I cant quite get with the whole idea . I think it would look somewhat " faddish " and also cause some concern for resale . We lived in a home with hardwood in every room but the master bath . The wood floors in my girls bathrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old at purchase and the baths had not one issue . Now the kitchen/LR floors were badthat was due to windows around the perimeter , poly pealing uphmm ? ( The cherry cabinets were a mess on the side that faced the sun also . ) I have to say WOOD floors are TIMELESS and never a question afterward if you made the right choice ! <p> My husband just installed the wood look alike tile in our hall bathroom , and I love it ! Its gorgeous . We plan to install it in our master bathroom as welland thinking about putting it in the kitchen too . <p> MODERN AND FAB ! ! I used a similar tile in my hall bathroom and honestlyI wish I had it throughout the house . Its substantial , sturdy and so pretty . I get so many compliments . I love my real hardwood floors , do n't  get me wrong , but once you add in the scratches from my two dogs and the CONSTANT upkeep to keep them shiny and pretty , my tile outshines them by a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like my chocolately-mahogony wood floors ) , so the looks are different and they compliment ( rather than compete with ) each other . It can be so tastefully done and I fully expect it to be a " selling point " rather than a " deterrent " when we go to sell our house . Just my opinion , of course ! : ) <p> Wow , these look fabulous ! ! I 'm so impressed at how much they look like wood . My only issue would be the " feel " of it ( as some others have noted ) since it is tile . In commercial spaces , bathrooms and even kitchens , I 'm sure its great , because you expect tile/ceramic feel in those places , but throughout a house ? I 'm not sure I 'd be happy walking barefoot on it all the time ! <p> Ive been struggling with this very question as I want to replace carpeting in my living room . I 'm leaning towards hardwood , but faux hardwood tile might be beautiful in our sun room . I 've appreciated this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home in South Florida that was an " as is " home . We are planning on gutting the kitchen , &amp; both baths . Plus it has beautiful ( insert sarcasm ) white ceramic tile dated from the 80s . We have already decided to go with this look . Living in Florida with a pool , dogs , and remodeling foot traffic all equal perfect arguments for this look ! We will be here for a long time and I do n't  see a problem at all with the longevity of this product ! Now if we could just get the project started ! <p> I love the authenticity , warmth and resale value of real hardwoods . There just is something you ca n't fake . But after having dealt with both a broken valve in the kitchen and a very leaky washer , I think the look-a-like tile is definitely something to be considered in any areas where water and/or moisture may be a factor . You never know when you 're going to come home to an inch of water in your kitchen . For any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real wood . <p> I re-did my powder room floor in " wood " tiles . It looks beautiful . I 'm not usually into faux anything but I convinced myself that I was n't trying to fool anyone , just install a tile floor that was an homage to hardwood . Haha , whatever , I have to say the tile is much nicer , richer looking than a laminate . I 've had guests , in astonishment , get down on their knees to give it a good feel too . <p> We just installed 1100 square feet of this " tile " wood for the entire downstairs of our house . We ABSOLTELY love it ! It has a woodgrain texture to it . We went with the dark grout that matches the wood . When we tell people it is tile , they literally bend down and touch it ! We live 1 hr . East of San Franscisco and it is great for the summers and the traffic of having a pool . It is super easy to clean . We just went through our first winter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion . I always wear socks in the winter anyway . It also made the rainy days a breeze with the mud and water being tracked in . Our friends got hardwood installed the same time my husband was installing our tile and they are constantly worried something is going to scratch the floor . They do n't  allow high heels past the front door . Personally I do n't  want a house where I cant enjoy company stopping by without policing what kind of shoes they are wearing . I can send you pictures of ours if you would like . We paid $2.56/sq foot for the tile plus the morter and grout at Home Depot . We used a 10% off Lowes coupon ( Home depot accepts them ) and our total was around $3500 for 1200 sq ft ( we bought extra ) . My husband installed it himself over the course of 3 months . We had 1/16 grout lines and it is beautiful . <p> I like it ! Does n't  work for us in Iowa ( where what tile we DO have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the tile room tempis FREEZING ) . But especially with very little grout , the end effect is awesome ! I cant use it on floors , but I love the idea of it as a backsplash ! <p> One more thing.about the grout . We cound never find a grout that dried as dark as we wanted , so before we sealed it , I got some wood stain and put it in a syringe and went down each and every grout line to stain the grout . It turned out perfect ! There was something about our water that was n't allowing the grout to dry the true color . It was n't a hard job in staining the grout , just long because we had so much ( 1100 sq . ft . ) . I would do it again in a hot second ! <p> I have seen it in person and its really stunning , I think that just like any other new product you have to think carefully about whether it fits with your goals and use it judiciously . I LOVE the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or plain tiles , but then of course it will be come associated with " hospital floor " and be less appealing in the home . <p> I feel like it runs the risk of being fakey-fake and potentially cheesy if you did a whole house or whole floor of a house , but for a kitchen or bathroom its genius . In my last home we replaced low quality carpet with high quality stone-look ceramic tile . It was a single story condo and we had already put dark wood laminate in the bedrooms so we did the entire public space in cream travertine-style tile but picked a coordinating warmer brown for the kitchen and bathroom . If the wood-look had been available at the time I 'm sure we would have strongly considered it ! <p> A friend recently re-did his bathroom with the wood-look tile in the shower enclosure and it makes it look like a Scandinavian sauna room . I love the comment about using the white-washed look for a beachy feel in a bathroom too . <p> We had ceramic tile in our entry way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Easy to clean and no worries about mud or dampness or scratches . However , when the kids were grown and we decided we wanted hardwood , tearing up the tile was a nightmare . The hammers and chisels needed to crack and pull up the tile made a mess of walls and baseboards , and took days of non-stop pounding and dust . So , go for tile , but only if you 're going to keep it for the long haul . <p> Hi KAte ! I am floor-hunting too for my new kitchen , and the only reason I passed up the ceramic look-alikes were the fact that it was colder on the feet ! Plus of course the danger of it breaking if you drop of something heavy on it , other than that , it looks great , pretty affordable and great for high traffic ! Good luck ! <p> Living in an apartment style condominium as we do , our flooring options are limited . Hardwood floors tend to transmit noise more than tile and are , as a result , hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing baseboard heaters as they must be installed under windows , making for inefficient heating in our long living/dining/kitchen space . These tiles together with radiant heat seem to offer a good solution to all of these challenges . <p> Awesome , awesome comments , everyone . Thanks to all who have it and are weighing in . I have two active boys and a large dog , and we live in Texas , and I love the look of hardwood . Maybe this is the answer to all my problems in life ? ! <p> I love the herringbone pattern ! ! Such an interesting question about wood vs. wood tile . I love the look of the wood tile , and I think if wood was n't an option , I would consider the tile . However , I love it for bathrooms and laundry rooms or maybe even a basement . I think my only sticking point is the sound of tile when you walk on it , and the fact that its cold vs. wood . But , this stuff definitely puts up a good argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen some of this recently that was surprisingly nice ! I 'd be curious to see a cost comparison of the " wood " tile ( +radiant heat because that 's a requirement for me ) vs. real wood vs. other wood products or even cork . <p> I actually really like the ideal of the look-alike tile . Sometimes I wonder if hardwood floors will ever go out of style ( I feel like they did when carpets were big at one point ) . I think hardwoods ( especially original ) add value to a home , but eventually that may not always be the case . I may try it out with a small room like a bathroom or in the basement and see how we like it ! <p> I like the look of look alike tile , but I 'd miss the warmth of real wood . ( And side note : next time you 're in Canada , you need to stop by ; ) ) I think its a great product to use in entryways , mudrooms , wet areas rooms where you would typically use tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole floor instead of hardwood , does n't  feel like it would be as comfortable as hardwood or even laminate . I have tile in the kitchen and its not comfortable to stand on over long periods of time . I think this tile or any tile is best used for transition spaces or rooms where you wont be standing a significant amount of time . Just my 2 cents ! <p> My husband installed Armstrong Alterna vinyl tile in our living room entrance , kitchen , laundry which is in our kitchen , and the entrance of our family April this year . We love it ! It looks like tile , it is warm on the feet , comfortable to stand on , our dishes do n't  break when dropped , easy to clean . We reviewed online comments from users and Consumer Reports sold us on this quality flooring product if anyone is interested . Just another option to check out . <p> I 'm not usually a fan of products that are made the look like the real thing , but I can see the practicality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  necessarily want real wood . My preference is to lay it in a herring bone pattern , rather than trying to copy hardwood in the plank pattern . <p> We installed barn wood ceramic tiles in our home about three years ago . I chose these because of many of the reasons you suggested . Easy maintenance , great with kids and pets , great for our farm life with moisture and whatever else they drag in . Everyone who sees it thinks it is hardwood and they ALWAYS get down and feel it before they believe me . We matched the grout to the vintage wood and the seams disappear . I love everything about them . They are timeless and classic and I have to say I think they will improve resale value in any home . I would say to go with a lighter wood or a variegated pattern . Otherwise , you will constantly see dust in them and be annoyed . My final vote.DO IT ! You wo n't regret it . <p> We had this tile in our beach house and loved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like new . Also , so easy to care for . We sold that home and bought a home in Va that had hardwood floors and I hated all the work to keep them looking nice . We had scratches and gouges in the hardwood that you do n't  have to worry about with tile . The cost up front is more but they will never need refinishing and will last forever . <p> We just finished remodelling our main floor kitchen , living room , bath , office with a Dura plank product and we LOVE this ! Hardwood was not practical with kids and a dog , plus I am not a fan of laminate flooring . Not to mention that our dishwasher just had a leaky hose and I am so glad our new flooring is water tight ! Laminate would have been destroyed . I live in Canada also and according to all the flooring companies , this is being used a lot now . Good luck ! <p> We tiled our hallway in a dark ceramic scraped wood lookalike and its beautiful . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tile is . I cant speak to resale value , but I 'm in an area where that would n't make or break a sale . We plan on tiling other rooms with it , and I 'm looking to use other styles . The best part , its SO easy to keep clean . Highly recommended . <p> Actually the first question one should ask is.is it green ? when I remove it from my floors in five / ten years time how is it disposed of , can it be recycled or is landfill ? is it far better to go faux and save a few trees my childrens children will appreciate ? I know everyone does not like to address this and it is a bit of a kill joy but these question have to be asked now if we want a future for our children . <p> We have an older house and most floors came with hard-wood which I love . Still , when rebuilding I for sure wanted a tile floor in the kitchen for cleaning reasons . Tiles are easy to clean , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold feel . We did immediately install radiant heating which is a must in my opinion . I doubt it is such and extra cost , because we did not put up any radiators on the walls . Now I can walk around the house barefoot summer &amp; winter . <p> As for the fake-wood tiles , due to having the " real thing " , I decided against it . I 've seen those tiles , considered them , but in the end I think the tiles should stay what they are . The feel of real hardwood is different and you can never get that with tiles I think . Plus , there are SO many pretty options in " regular " tiling , we eventually decided on a light , 60*60cm tile ( Ragno Jazz ) and I still love the look of it . ( : <p> I also wonder how much of a hype this wood-tile trend is , is it something that in 20 years will be something only grannies have ? <p> I think it would look great if its done well and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weve considered putting it in our front entry , but I wonder how it would look next to real hardwood in the rest of your home ? If you need to replace all of the floors in the home you are buying , would you put hardwood in the rooms next to the ones with the hardwood tiles ? Just in a very different finish so they would n't compete ? How would that work ? I 'd love some suggestions Kate . : ) <p> While I do n't  like the idea of laminate that looks like wood , I DO like the idea of tile that looks like wood , particularly in bathrooms and kitchens , it offers more texture and feels a bit more authentic than laminate . It would definitely wear better in wet environments than real wood , but I am not sure I could embrace it in other living spaces , like you said it can be a bit cold and hard underfoot . <p> What a great post ! ! A few months ago at a decorators show house I first saw the faux wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray plank . This was right up against real hard wood in a dark walnut stain and although the look was a bit different , it all blended and was gorgeous . <p> We are in the early stages of an addition and will be replacing the flooring ( old , messy looking slate ) in the front hall and installing new floors in the enlarged kitchen and new breakfast room . <p> My dilemma is which color of faux wood tile to choose the rest of our house has hardwood throughout , in a honey-pine stain , and that is not going to change ( I would prefer the darker walnut ) . The wood-look tile will be smack up against the real wood in several areas so I really need to get this one right . Any pointers ? if anyone wants to email me directly I 'd appreciate some pointersemail protected <p> I live in a century home ( wonky floors ) and run a private home daycare ( lots of traffic , oozing children and toys toys toys ) . My entire house is done in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resale value , well there 's nothing like the real thing but , I do believe people are starting to embrace the idea AND they now make it look soooo good . <p> Do n't  forget about vinyl planks ! We had them installed a few months ago and absolutely love it ! No grout lines , waterproof , stands up to kids , pets , and notoriously shifty foundations in our area . We chose one that had distressing so you can feel the roughness and it does n't  get cold like tile . Another great option for people on a budget ! <p> I love the look of wood look tile . We strongly considered it in our major remodel ( still going on . ) Some looks more authentic than others and you 'll be able to spot what you like right away . We ultimately decided to use real hard wood because the installation of the tile was going to cost so much . We were able to negotiate the tiles down to $3.50 a square foot , but underlayment and installation were going to triple that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide hand scraped planks . Since it just takes felt underlayment and DH knows how to do it so the costs stop there . We were talking about a lot of square feet , so the price was a major consideration . Also , one thing we learned while shoppingto get that real hardwood look you need to use 1/16th inch grout lines with unsanded grout . If you are hiring the work done , this increases the cost since the larger grout spaces can help adjust a floor that gets slightly off square as the tiler works . There 's no room for imperfection with the smaller grout lines , but the smaller lines are essential to a real wood look . <p> Thanks Angela for the tips on installation , yes precision will be key and the labor increases the price , but were pretty good at tile work or we can help with the install to keep costs down . The home is split level so the tile would be in the entry , kitchen , breakfast nook and living room and we 'd use hardwood in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful for all of this feedback ! <p> We currently live in CA and we love it ! We installed in on our entire first floor and it looks amazing as well as stands up to a one and two year old who can drag and drop anything and I do n't  have to worry . We love it so much that we are also using it in a house we are building in UT ! <p> My husband and I just built our dream home , so we have looked at all the options in depth . Wood look alike tile is gorgeous and practical . On the plus side : gorgeous , easy to maintain , can hide dirt ( until you get to it ) , ultra-durable . On the negative side : can be cold ( do instal radiant heating on a timer in bathrooms and areas you will walk around in bare feet its pricier in the short run , but you will love it ) ; the house echos if you have too much of it . Keep it classic . No patterns other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For resale value and comfort under your feet ( tile can be hard on your feet and back when you stand on it for a long time ( such as when making endless meals for the family ) , hardwood is still the way to go . Its classic , never goes out of style , can be refinished , warm on the feet . My choice was to use it in our mudroom and bathrooms . Hardwood is throughout the rest of our home . ( Our last home also had it and the floor is still looking good 16 years , three boys , and one active Australian Shepherd later . Good luck ! <p> I installed the wood look vinyl plank floating floor 4 years ago in my living room . Its so great with my dogs that I also installed it in my kitchen , master bedroom and master bath . It is installed directly over a concrete slab . It is not horribly cold in the winter , it is holding up great so far , everyone that sees it thinks its real wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed it all by myself . No special tools are required . My neighbors think it looks so great that two of them installed it too ! <p> We installed Cerim wood-look porcelain tile years ago in a master bath reno and it still looks fabulous ! We used the Ellinton color which looks great with the cherry furniture in the adjoining master bedroom . <p> I sell real estate in Sacramento and came across this " faux wood " flooring about five years ago and was amazed and the quality of reproduction in texture , color and richness . When I saw it I knew they we on to something . Two years ago we installed it in our kitchen laundry area since we could only really have tile due to the issue of water . I love the look of hardwood floors in kitchens and baths but quite frankly have seen very few that hold up to exposure to water and time . Our floors have held up magnificently and people are shocked to find out it is ceramic tile , not wood . I now recommend this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ease of installation . Do n't  get me wrong , I LOVE real hardwoods , but when wood is not a viable option it is good to know there is a great alternative that can provide the same warmth , look and feel . Plus , wood-tile has the added benefit of not having to refinish , worried about scuffs , or rough and tumble kids and pets . In addition , it does not have the limited life that come with laminate floorings . There is nothing more unattractive that walking into a home for sale and seeing faded laminate from windows and bad raised plastic floor joints that hold laminate floors downand not to mention the clicking sound when you walk on them . <p> Buyers notice these things and the response to the tile has been nothing but good . Good luck with your decision . Look forward to here more . <p> We installed " wood " porcelain tile in a covered patio/outdoor room and love it ! It looks like hardwood , but can stand up to the outdoor elements . We have hardwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a little lighter . They are not right next to each other , but you can see one room from the other and they do not look weird in the same line of sight . We opted for one that was fairly distressed , since we have a pool and did n't  want any slipping accidents , and it has been great . We are currently working on remodeling the rest of the back yard , and are actually carrying the tile out onto the patio to connect that spaces . People are always startled that it is n't actual wood . <p> Hi Kate , I agree with you about the lookalike wood tile . I love it ! Our neighbors installed it throughout their whole house I believe . After seeing it , I noticed it in a restaurant also ! I think its a smart idea because its more durable . Our neighbor mentioned that its more expensive but if you do it yourself , that is not an issue ! <p> We have real hardwood in our home along with carpet . A year ago we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't be more pleased with it . We even carried it over into our walk in shower . Our tile man cut it into tiny 2+2 squares and tiled the entire shower floor . On the main bathroom floor we did a simple side by side plank . We also opted for the radiant heat underneath . We live in Michigan and have some pretty cold winters so we were thrilled to be able to have the option of warming it up underfoot . We also turned it sideways and used it as our baseboard trim as opposed to a real wood baseboard trim . It really is a beautiful product . <p> Weve been looking at tile a lot lately as were having our front and back porches tiled with slate and porcelain . I had a chance to look at so , so many options and the wood look is gorgeous . Personally , I do n't  think it would work in our space but I just love it . <p> I have the wood plank ceramic tiles in my bathroom . It was a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project and start again . The floor must be absolutely level . No give whatsoever . The first planks I installed were 12 x 18 . The longer and Skinner the tiles the harder it is . You need a special leveling wedge not those spacers to keep the tile level at both ends . It was one big mess . I am not new to installing tiles , I have done the entryway , kitchen , utility room and another bathroom . <p> I ended up releveling the floor , bought 24+12 tiles , used the leveling wedge and finally it looks great . I spoke to a tile person , and he said I chose the hardest tiles to lay down . I must say it looks fantastic , but I would never want to try and do a big space DIY , I would hire someone . Oh I love the funky shaped tiles above , where can these be purchased ? I have never seen them anywhere . <p> The wood look tile was a great compromise at our house . We have had real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took a beating .. we do n't  have pets or children at home but dropped keys , TV remotes and just plain old tracked in dirt took a toll on the look of the beautiful wood . We recently purchased an older home to remodel and began the debate of what flooring to install . My husband was adamant that he wanted the wood .. but I questioned the ability to keep it looking like new as this home has more indoor/outdoor traffic than our previous residence . About the time we needed to make our selection the longer 36inch planks became available with the hand scraped look . We made the choice to install this product in our entry , den and dining room.I just love it . For us it is the best of both worlds , we have the dark rich color and grain pattern of the wood with a floor that is easy to keep and durable . It may not work for everyone and I appreciate the " real " vs " faux " debate.I usually stick to the " real " as wellbut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winner . The floors do have to be completely level , especially with the longer planks , but we were fortuante to find an excellent installer who did a wonderful job . I vote thumbs up ! <p> I 've never heard of tile that looks like wood until now ! Thanks for introducing me to a new product . Its beautiful , and I would imagine it would be very easy to care for . I love the look with little to no grout lineI never would have thought that it was n't wood ! Wouldnt radiant heat underneath be wonderful ? <p> I fought long and hard to get tile that looked like wood installed in our kitchen . But because we were converting it back to a rental property the possibility of moving back into our house when we moved home was highly unlikely . So instead we used up the remaining engineered flooring we had . Now that we are moving home and back into our house ! I told my husband I am ripping up the flooring and installing the tile that looks like wood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , but our main entrance into the house is off the kitchen and hardwood floors would just take a beating from the ice melt we use in the winter . <p> Ps I know I have been on vacation for a while and havent caught up on all my blog reading , but are you moving to SLC ( Salt Lake City ) ? <p> I 'd never heard of this before . It is gorgeous AND practical ! We have neighbors who replaced wood flooring with ceramic tile in their large entry and adjoining office , bath , and kitchen ( with radiant heat below ) . Because the tile picks up colors in the rest of their decor , it looks as good as or maybe better than the wood . Whodathunk ? <p> Thanks for the eye-opener on this " new thing , " as always . By the way , I love your writing style too , all the practical tips , and all the beautiful ideas . Even when I get busy and do n't  have much time for blog reading , I always find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of inspiration and help . Thank you ! : ) <p> I have a love affair with wood ! ! ! I too considered the wood look alike but I am on my feet the 16 hours I am awake ( I know , working on that with trying to learn how to relax ) and my legs would be shot ! ! I 've lived with tile in my last house and I just couldnt do it again . ESPECIALLY in the kitchen were I am on my feet the most . I do think the look alike looks beautiful , but its not for me . I had engineered wood before and I would NEVER do that agin either . This time we went with thick real hickory . Even in the kitchen . BEST investment we EVER made . We got the character grade with knots and dings , and we have 2 dogs , 2 teenagers with tons of people in and out , and we live VERY HARD . Real wood heals itself . REAL WOOD HANDS DOWN ! ! <p> I am so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of picking a wood-look tile for our basement remodel ! We definitely wanted to go with tile in our basement wood on a concrete basement floor is a no-no , and I 've heard of lots of people who have problems with vinyl peeling up at the seams when installed on concrete . Wood-look tile was the perfect solution for us ; it can stand up to a potentially moist basement floor and still have the warm look of wood ! <p> My husband was skeptical because most wood-look tile planks are wider and shorter than a normal hardwood plank and he thought it might look strange , but after visiting Disney World a couple months ago we were both sold . Disney has installed wood-look tile in numerous places throughout the park ( most notably in the new Fantasyland expansion ) and not only did it look incredible , it easily stands up to hundreds of people walking over it every day . I almost went to Guest Relations to find out who the manufacturer was ! <p> I installed this in my 1st floor bath a year agodark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white subway tile .. very simple-My contractor did n't  like it , and many people thought it was a bad idea . ( The one issue I had was with the grout lines-it should be laid with tight grout lines to make it look more realistic , and less " tile-ey " . ) <p> I love it ( I knew I would ) -everyone that sees the bathroom comments on the floor ( all very positive ! ) . I love real wood floors , but in certain applications , this tile is the way to go . <p> I 've also noticed many restaurants at the Jersey Shore using this flooring in their Post-Sandy renovations . <p> My husband and I saw it in Home Depot and were amazed at how much it resembled wood . The gym where I work out had hardwood ( I thought ) in the dressing room . When I reached down to touch it to see if it was real , I found out it was tile ! It fooled me ! <p> I love the ceramic wood-look tile . The warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kids . It might be a little colder ( literally not hold heat as well ) than wood , but I think that can be overcome by area rugs and draperies , among other textiles . <p> So glad you posted this ! We just installed " wood tiles " in our mudroom and love it so much we are installing it in our new master bathroom addition . We are heating the floor , so no cold feet for us ! Needless to say we are loving this look of wood and the durability of tile . <p> Great post and comments ! We are building a home in a few years on a lot we recently purchased , and I 'm already collecting great ideas for it . Your post and comments have definetly got the wheels turning here ! We will have a walk out basement .. and this wood tile would be great for that area ! I 've also seen it out at stores and restaurants and think it is a very modern look . And thanks for the tip about the heated floors as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to keep up with it ! <p> Its easy on the feet and does n't  require an underlayment or glue . I love those inspiration pictures you have too . I thought about getting the glue down version and laying it in a herringbone pattern , but I went with a regular straight install in the end for the easy and quick install . good luck with your choice ! <p> I was excited to see your post on wood look tile ! I work for a tile distributor and have the fun job of selecting tile that we import and distribute . Its so interesting to see the comments of homeowners . We too were initially skeptical of tile that looks like wood . In our territory real wood floor is very popular for the residential market . Commercially we have seen lots of interest retail , car dealerships and the high end hotels have been using it for quite some time ! You can not beat porcelain tile for durability ! <p> The tile industry has made dramatic advances in the last five years . Digital ink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like stone . They quickly moved to replicating wood and it is amazing what is now coming out of the Italian factories . When we traveled to Cersaie last September the wood look DOMINATED the market with most factories presenting multiple wood look collections . The hottest selling trend in Europe is definitely wood look tile . So if you are considering using tile shop around and you will be able to find the look that will work for your space . We have a awesome new one that arrives next week and I have 23 planks sitting outside my office to review ! As a teaser Italy is always designing and the newest idea is a mixed graphic concept ( wood , concrete , stone ) SUPER EXCITING ! <p> I have the exact one in the second picture ! We installed it about 4 years ago throughout my living area and kitchens open floor plan . We absolutely LOVE everything about it ! This was the best option for us because we live in a ranch so any hardwood was going to dull and wear out and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much one path . <p> Its also super easy to clean ! ! <p> Our heating system is right below in the center of our home so it actually keeps our floors awesomely warm in the winter . <p> We are getting wood looking ceramic tiled installed in most of the house next week . I am so excited to have it throughout the house with a 4 year old and 5 big dogs ! Cost was cheaper than hardwood and the no maintenance and ease of clean up sold it for us . <p> I love the look of the faux wood tiles Ive seen and I love the list of advantages , but I personally cant get over the old fashioned idea that things should look like what they are . I think I 'd rather have tile that looks like tile or real hardwood . <p> I loved reading this post shortly after we decided to use wood tile in our home . We had water damage and have to replace the kitchen and bathroom floors ( they share a wall the leak started in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said tile is by far the best because of the water issue . So we are going for it and I could n't be more excited ! <p> I live in a loft condo in an old brick high school building . I 'm on the ground floor and currently have hardwood floors that were installed on the concrete slab . I have a lot of cupping and buckling because of the moisture . I have been thinking about cork flooring as an alternative when my hardwoods get so bad that I have to replace them . However , you have opened my eyes to another option . Considering the absolute moisture impermiability of porcelain tile , it might be just the thing for my 1,000 sq ft loft . Since I live in Georgia , the coolness would be a plus in the summer , but I would probably want to have the floors heated for winter time . Considering that even without A/C in the hot , southern summers , my place already stays about 77-81 degrees , and will stay about 65 in the winter even without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric bill to defray some of the costs ! <p> If you Live in a seaside place ( i do -toooons of sand and dust ) in a 10-month summer country ( Greece ) Have kids Have a ( rather stupid ) dog Love your house aesthetic but not so much its maintenance Keep your windows open 24/7 THEN YES These tiles are perfect ! Super easy to clean , in fact dirt and spills do n't  even show , cool on your feet in summer and for said dog ( and far away from my all white sofa ) . I warm it up during winter with area rugs that I love . The installation price here is actually a lot cheaper than hardwoods but I think that it pays off over time since no refinishing or special cleaning products are required . <p> I fought long and hard to get wood look tile in our home ! We used Interceramics Sunwood collection in Cowboy Brown in the 6+24 size . I cant attest to durability yet as the floor was just grouted last week , but my tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2100sf . He did a random pattern and any cuts were utilized in other areas and it looks amazing . It was a bit expensive but real hardwoods and vinyl were not an option with a 150lb Great Dane and young son with lots of friends visiting . We live in South Texas so we do n't  have to worry about under floor heating . <p> We had the tile that looks like your second picture installed in the bedrooms in a second home in central FL . We were advised against using any laminate or real wood because of the humidity . I wanted something durable and easy to keep clean . And I wanted to make sure that we would not have any water damage . I do wish my installer had used thinner grout lines , but otherwise , we love it . Got it at Lowes . When we had a guest visit , he could not believe it was not real wood . He had to keep touching it . He now has decided to use it on a porch on a house he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bedrooms than an 18+18 whitish typical square tile would , and suits the country where the house is located . <p> We homeschool our 5 children so are at our house 7 days a week . We installed hardwood looking tile in our dining room and continued it down the hall . We 've had nothing but compliments about it , and it is so durable . We installed it touching on all sides , so there is very little grout involved . We love it and would never go back to hardwood in a high traffic area again . Ours is still sold at Lowes and was so reasonably priced compared to hardwood . Because we live in the South , cold feet are not often a problem ! <p> Hi ! We appreciate the mention in your blog and your post , " lookalike wood " , but I thought I would point out that our product is actually solid engineered wood ! The tiles are actually real wood , not a porcelain or composite product . I can appreciate the functionality of faux wood products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . All the best ! Jamie <p> Installing tile that looks like wood seems like it would be great for kitchens and bathrooms . Like you mentioned , tile is more water resistant than hardwood flooring and it is more durable , so you would n't have to worry about scratching ( especially if you have active dogs running around your home . ) <p> Were installing some in our basement next week ! Delivery is on its way . I like the texture . Plus , our basement unfortunately floods periodically . We had to rip out carpeting . The concrete floor could have been prettied up , but its still concrete . I wanted the space to feel cozy for a media room . Wood tile seemed the perfect solution . 23102 @qwx883102

Julie has been traveling to exotic countries all her life , which gave her an appreciation for different cultures and the handwork done by the artisans in different countries . After her first trip to Turkey she started importing goods for her former store in Palm Springs but she has relocated to the Bay Area . <p> Julie and her mother have just opened a beautiful store Bohca Bazaar in downtown Petaluma , California . Our town is famous for its antique stores and we have many , so it is wonderful to have a very different boutique filled with authentic textiles and home goods imported from Turkey and Uzbekistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Julie considers her partner in Istanbul family , she has stayed with him many times and they have a long time business relationship . It was so nice to connect with a person who speaks the design language with extensive knowledge of the history and craftsmanship of authentic Kilim , Suzani , Ikat and similar woven and embroidered fabrics from the Middle East and Asia . <p> Julie was kind enough to answer all of my questions and take pictures in her shop , I learned so much ! The following are quotes from Julies answers to my question , enjoy learning a bit more about these beautiful textiles from an expert ! <p> What are the recognizable differences between Kilim , Suzani , and Ikat ? <p> Kilim is a traditional Turkish woven wool flat weave carpet with geometric repeating patterns . It is made with strands of vegetable dyed wool knotted onto warps and held together by pressing the wefts tightly , the Kilim motifs are made by interweaving the variously colored wefts and warps . <p> Suzani is traditional to Uzbekistan and is needle work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using a chain , satin and buttonhole stitch along with couching . Couching is laying a thread around a design and then adding a second stitch to secure it , giving is a raised feel around the motif . <p> Patterns often are repeating floral designs , and can include vines or birds . Really high quality vintage versions are available , often with a black cotton background and silk stitching . More rudimentary Suzani can be found , they are not as expensive but whimsical and fun and a great piece for the beginning collector . Reproductions are generally only in print work . <p> Suzanis in good condition are best displayed on a wall , bedcover , throw , etc. but you can take a damaged suzani , salvage the the pieces in good condition and make bench seats , cushions , poufs , ottomans as a lovely addition to any room . <p> Ikat is made with a resist dye process , to create the patterns the threads are bound or tied off , dyed and repeated , then woven together in a weft , warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from Uzbekistan , however Ikat weave can be found in Indonesia , Central and South America , Central Asia . Okinawa on of the Japanese islands is one of the few places you will find double Ikat . <p> The fabric for the Ikat pillows we carry in the shop are woven/resist dyed velvet on one side and hand woven resist/dyed silk on the opposite side in complementary patterns and colors . <p> The Kilim furniture is made by my partner and they are are of Turkish origin . The sofas take 4 Kilim rugs to make , this is very difficult because each Kilim is one of a kind . When designing the piece , my partner has to study the patterns of different carpets in order to create a cohesive pattern . Smaller pieces like poufs , ottomans , and benches can be made from the best remaining piece from and old carpet . <p> Because our textiles are authentic , if taken care of they become heirloom pieces . When decorating , I think it is really important to spend the extra money for one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind , handcrafted piece of art . " <p> Tell me about the amazing lamps and ceramics in the shop . <p> " The ceramics are called Iznik which is the same as the ancient town of Nicea , not far southeast of Istanbul . Iznik Golu is the lake that the town of Izni/Nicea sits on . In the 15th century artisans inspired by the blue and white porcelain from China adopted their own method of making the ceramics . <p> They use quartz ground to a fine powder , then formed into a clay . The pottery is hand formed and painted , with raised motifs . All motifs have a meaning : the tulip is God and the Rose is Mohammed . The lamps are all made in Turkey , they and are called mosaic color lights and are very labor intensive . " <p> Boots and shoes are New Suzani , the current fashion is platform but we do carry flats that are called Babette . We also produce mens and womens Kilim shoes , handbags and travel bags . " <p> Ladies , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for winter ! <p> Julie also carries dyed patchwork rugs , ottomans , benches , Turkish towels and robes , and authentic pashminas too ( I bought one for my Mom for her birthday ) . Bay Area collectors and designers , be sure to give Julie a call or take a trip to the shop , she can source these textiles for you or your client , or have something made custom ! <p> Julies husband passed away from a rare bone cancer of the spine Chordoma so proceeds from each sale from her shop go to that foundation to honor her husband . Bohca Bazaar is on Facebook and will soon have an online shop to offer these textiles to the rest of the country , so be sure to follow along . Thank you Julie for sharing your expertise ! <p> I would work in that shop for free just so I could be surrounded by all of that beauty ! What a gem you have at your disposal . Would love to see some examples of people incorporating these textiles into their homes . <p> OMG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . We have a morrocan seating with cushions on the floor that go all around the room . I have been looking for something like this for years to just set up that rooms style . With the right pieces it would look fantastic . i look forward to her online website , since i am all the way in Atlanta , Ga . Please inform us when she gets her website so I can purchase some things . Beautiful , Beautiful <p> Amazing ! This is right up my alley , as I have a passion for textiles ( and sell a rugs &amp; pillows on my site ) . I love learning more about the different styles . I have done a lot of needlework myself and have a true appreciation for its beauty . If she ever wants to teach a workshop , I 'm all in ! <p> As a young girl my family lived in Turkey for a few years . I remember having dinner with my parents " rug dealer " and how they showed us the painstaking process of hand tying some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I just love . <p> Imagine this store multiplied hundreds of times on the streets of old Istanbul .

Spray paint happens to be one of my favorite tools especially on small pieces of decor , but it can work really well on furniture too . A few years ago I wrote about spray painting furniture , and most of my tips are there , and today I wanted to share two pieces I recently finished , the first is a set of chests spray painted gloss black and the second is a console table spray painted white with gold detail . <p> My supply list for spray painting includes the following : a drop cloth for painting in a well ventilated area , spray primer , spray paint , a safety respirator , ScotchBlue Painter 's Tape , a sanding wedge or sheets of sandpaper , a spray paint nozzle gun ( shown below ) and a protectant ( not shown ) . <p> The steps are simple , first remove all hardware and/or hinges , clean off any debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've used this handy little sanding tool for years with replaceable sheets of sandpaper . <p> Tape off any drawers so you can spray the fronts but prevent overspray inside . I 've been a fan of of ScotchBlue Painter 's Tape for years . I wrap it around the drawers , then tuck the drawers just inside before priming . <p> Make sure you wear a respirator when spray painting , you do n't want to breathe in any of the fumes that come with this process . Use a spray paint nozzle gun ( found in the spray paint department ) and spray your furniture with a bonding primer moving the can back and forth to create a thin layer and to avoid drips . When dry , lightly sand with a fine grit sandpaper ( if necessary ) to remove any drips that might occur . <p> I apply two to three light coats of spray paint lighter fine coats are the best . When the layers of spray paint are dry , wipe down any residue with cloth and apply a protective coat to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray paint furniture , the one problem I run into is a splotchy sheen on the surface , meaning the color is even but the sheen is not . I discovered two ways to remedy it . For a satin or gloss finish use Polycrylic and apply with a sponge chip brush and work in cooler temperatures between 60 and 75 degrees because the product dries very fast . For a more matte finish or subtle sheen ( or for white paints ) , use wax and apply it with a soft cotton rag , then buff it out . <p> This plain console I bought at HomeGoods was just fine in gray but with gloss white spray paint , it coordinates better with my guest room . <p> I found these gorgeous midcentury inspired chests at a local thrift store two months ago and was going to use them for a friend 's bedroom project in progress but it turned out they were n't quite big enough for her space .

The cabinets , the fixtures , the tile . Yep , you 're stuck with it . So how do you make the space feel more like you ? I thought about all the ways to tackle the job and came up with ten solutions . <p> 1 . Curtains with Style . Add a happy shower curtain in a bold floral or a mod geometric and suddenly the space has more color and personality . <p> 2 . Hide the floor . A stylish floor mat helps to disguise flooring and also brings comfort underfoot . There are plenty of retail options or you can get creative with a DIY project . As an alternative , ask if the landlord will allow you to adhere peel and stick linoleum tiles . <p> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom like a rustic chair , table , ladder , or a storage cabinet . Turn shelves or walls into a mini art gallery . Paper the inside of the medicine cabinet . It 's small touches like these that add charm and will make the space more cheerful and more you . <p> 6 .

Instead of fighting it , go with it and have fun while you 're doing so by either playing off the retro vibe or adding modern touches . <p> 7 . Refinish the Tub and/or Tile . To save money in a bathroom remodel last year , we used an epoxy kit to rescue the dingy tub .

I have a friend with a 1950s ranch with Nile Green bathroom fixtures . She painted the walls apricot and accessorized with white and it is stunning . A little imagination can go a long way to accepting the things you can not change . Thanks for a great series ! <p> I 'm loving this series . I get so excited when I see it pop up on my reader ! Great ideas for renters . I 'm tackling my bathroom in the next couple weeks , so Ill definitely look to this article for inspiration ! <p> As an ardent followers of everything you write I have been inspired by so many things you do and am these days especially happy for the " renters " series , since , temporarily , having moved to a States for a few years , we are renting a house . Our biggest problem so far has been the terrible looking dark brown fake wood ( that is vinyl ) wood paneling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to update those ? Painting is not really an option , since the owner of the house dissuaded us from that , and on your advice I have looked into temporary wallpaper , but they are quite pricey to cover for example the living room walls . So , I 'd be grateful if in any future post , or here , youd offer some solutions how to beautify those panels . Thank you so much in advance ! <p> Thanks Veronika ! Does the fake wood go all the way to the ceiling ? I 'd consider covering it with the 4 x 8 ' panels from Lowes that come in several styles including tongue and groove . You could use a temporary adhesive , or something super sticky like Bondera Tile Mat to hold it in place . You could leave them white or paint them any color . They 're very thin so you can trim them around windows and doors too . That 's what I 'd do ! Kate <p> Some awesome ideas ! I rent ( which I find really hard with all the wonderful ideas in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using neutral baskets and items that can be easily removed really , I faked some roman blinds for my bathroom and pinned them up with drawpins . I love our wee bathroom now this is it here //tinyurl.com/c688zfc . I 'm quite proud of it . <p> Great ideas ! ! Somewhat along with the towel idea , back when I rented I invested in a good shower head that I could quickly and easily switch out with the rentals . The bathroom always seemed much better when I was getting a good shower and I could switch it back to the original when I left and bring my good one with me ! <p> Great ideas ! I 've used quite a few of these over the years . These will also work not only for renters , but also as a temporary fix for owners who do n't  have the budget to re-do over the entire bathroom . <p> We did n't  have the budget to do it all over so we painted the wall tiles and built-in ceramic holders all white . I did n't  know about Rustoleum Tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handy ) we used TSP to give it all a good cleaning beforehand and used good quality primer and exterior paint . We wore masks and opened all the windows and let it dry for a week it has held up for almost 5 years now . <p> For the floor , we used cheap , plain white peel &amp; stick tiles right over the old tiles a trick we discovered use white caulking as grout fillers on the old tiles , then a little on the bottom of the peel &amp; stick tiles almost like a glue , and then use the caulking to seal around the edges of the peel &amp; stick tiles ( particularly around the toilet bowl and tub ) . We have yet to have a tile pop up 5 years and still holding and looks great ! <p> Even though I own a home , still a great series ! Light fixtures can be changed out as well and then changed back when you move which makes a big impact ! For the ones with the hideous fake wood panels , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how about making your own huge canvases with fabric for cheap art as well as disguising some of the wall ? I recently bought this really pretty patterned neutral wallpaper , a double roll for just $13 and used it for the backs of my curio cabinets . Maybe you can built those panels ( quick , cheap and easy ) and use a cheap wallpaper as well . The wallpaper I 'm talking about could also be painted . <p> I rent and have an original , bright pink tiled bathroom . I say when you 've got a bathroom like that , just go with the flow ! I as a designer I rarely get to work with pink ( or any of those other colors you typically see in the old bathrooms ) . So I embraced it and I had so much fun ! <p> I used to live in a rental that had ugly shower doors in the bathroom and I was really bummed that I could n't hang a shower curtain to liven up the bathroom , until I realized that I still could hang a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed a tension rod in front of the doors and hung a lovely shower curtain . It made such a difference in the bland bathroom ! <p> For the reader with the vinyl walls , I once hung inexpensive curtains to cover cinderblock . I could n't drill or hammer into it or stick anything like temporary wallpaper to the rough surface , so I used heavy-duty Command hooks ( removable ) along the top of the wall to hang the cheapest white curtains Ikea had to offer . I actually really enjoyed the softness of it , and they came right off when I moved out . The same basic white curtains are now covering up the vertical blinds in my current rental ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057699 @3257699/ <h> New Studio Flooring <p> By Kate Riley October 3 , 2016 <p> I 've written before about the studio above my garage , you can see the entire space featured in this post from last year . Presently , my stepdaughter lives in the studio , she is headed to nursing school in January , but right now she is working to save money for her continuing education . <p> Once she moves out , my plan is to rent this space out as a weekend AirBnB . One of the things that needed to happen first was to replace the flooring since the old carpet was stained and rippling in places . Also I was n't a fan of the dated linoleum floor in the bathroom and kitchen . <p> For this project I partnered with Floor &amp; Decor which I 've done several times before , they have a fantastic selection of in stock tile and flooring products . I 'm a big fan of luxury vinyl plank flooring because it looks like wood but it is waterproof so you can use it in spaces that are exposed to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a peek at the space with the new floors before I moved the furniture back inside . I love them ! <p> The product I chose was NuCore vinyl plank in Driftwood Oak , I loved the mid tone taupe color , not too brown and neutral enough to complement any decor I rotate in and out of here . Also it comes with a residential lifetime warranty , that 's huge for me . <p> Demo started with good old fashioned elbow grease , the carpet came out first . We probably should have removed the baseboard first , but we did that after , see below . The tedious part was removing the tack strips and sticky little padding remnants which took a few hours . <p> We removed the baseboard first using a blade to cut through the caulking , next a screwdriver ( or chisel ) and hammer to wedge down inside and pop it off . We ended up damaging the baseboard so instead of reusing it , we replaced it with new baseboard . If you 're careful you can repurpose it but it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( no glue , nails , or adhesive , yay ! ) it requires expansion gaps around the perimeter . These adjustable spacers against the wall were the starting point . You can also see the texture of the planks in these more up close shot . <p> This floating floor installed pretty easily . We hired a helper to assist us getting this done since the studio is 650 square feet , but this is a project you can do yourself with the right tools . The pieces snap into place using a tongue and groove style click together system . The two main tools used were a tapping block and a mallet , used together they guarantee tight seams between planks. - The tapping block helps get your seams tighter when you use the mallet to connect planks together . <p> There are various cutting tools you can use , a sharp utility blade will score it and you can break it in two pieces that way . We used a jigsaw to notch areas around door frames and a skilsaw to rip the long way when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My favorite feature with this product is that it is waterproof ! ! This allowed us to continue into the bathroom . This was really important to me because I love consistent flooring in connected community spaces , it creates really nice flow . Since this is a studio with an open bedroom and living space , when not in use the bathroom door is open to allow more light into the studio . <p> Because this is a waterproof product , it could continue into the kitchen as well . Before there was carpet in the living room space and old linoleum in the kitchen but now there is a seamless transition , this makes me happy ! ! ! <p> Yesterday I was able to bring some furniture back into the space , this is the view of the living area looking at the bookcases , the kitchen you can see is on the left . <p> The bedroom furniture goes on this other side of the space , you can see more of it in this studio tour from last year . <p> - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with bare feet , it does n't  feel exactly like real wood , it feels like a textured vinyl product . I would n't label it plasticky like some of the older vinyl products but its not uncomfortable at all . It 's warmer to the touch than tile but not as warm as real wood . It does clean up easily , I used a broom to clear off debris , and you can get it extra clean with any easy mop product like a Swiffer . I love that is looks great , is guaranteed by a lifetime warranty , and is waterproof ! <p> This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Floor &amp; Decor . The opinions and text are all mine . <h> 21 comments <p> Just installed vinyl plank in our cabin last week . Very happy with it so far ! Went with vinyl for all of the same reasons you did . Plus well have lots of boot , dog and mud traffic and I hope it holds up well to them <p> I installed a NuCore Chestnut Wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . It was quick and easy to install ! The planks were extra rigid . Its also very easy to maintain . I simply sweep or wet mop it and voila ! <p> HI Carolyn , we moved our appliances out before installing it , then moved them back in after we installed the vinyl planks . We did not remove the kitchen cabinets , we ran the flooring up to the edges and replaced the toe kicks after installation . We did removed the bathroom vanity and toilet before the flooring installation since that was a smaller issue . <p> Looks fantastic , Kate ! I love Floor &amp; Decor ! We are working with them on our basement reno and doing NuCore down there too . Everyone is going to want to stay there when you Air BnB it ! ! ! Hope you are doing well sweet friend ! We need another dinner one of these days ; ) xo <p> Nothing like a completely waterproof floor ! Water-resistant is one thing , but when you can literally leave a puddle of water ( accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and come back to absolutely no deterioration or damage at all , that 's something else entirely . Brilliance . <p> Would you suggest vinyl plank for the first floor of a home vs laminate ? We love real wood but pricey .

When we went to sell our house the realtor insisted that we take it down . At that point , who knows how long the wallpaper had been up . I have no idea if my mom even tried a wallpaper steamer . But she did try to tear it down . We ended up scrubbing it off one little spot at a time . I was 12 and my parents made me scrub the wall every day before I could go see my friends . It took us weeks to scrub all the paper off . I do n't think I 'll ever be putting grasscloth up on my walls after that scarring experience . . . <p> I am smiling big time at Torey 's comment , because when we started tearing off the grasscloth in the dining room , the very same thing happenedplus , they put it up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we 're just going to save the trouble and replace the paneling with beadboard . The grasscloth in the hallway , however , IS getting painted . We did n't  ' even attempt to get that off . : ) <p> I absolutely LOVE your style . I 've been reading some other decorating/house styling/etc blogs for a while , and yours is by far the coolest . This color scheme is so soothing , and yes , I am totally tempted to dive into the DIY wallpapering bliss that you have created in your home . Bummer though , I 'm in a rental , and painting is the extent of our abilities to change the walls ( oh and pictures too ) . I love the " exotic " walls though . <p> I have wallpapered before but , it 's always been with prepasted paper . Well , except for when I papered my bathroom with sheet music , but that 's entirely different . I ca n't imagine how difficult that grasscloth must have been for you to deal with . Yikes ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Growing up , we had nearly every room in the house papered . It was a pain in the patootie every time Mom decided she wanted to change the decor . I would rather just paint and maybe do a faux treatment or stencil to make it pop . <p> Having said that , I love , love , love the way the grasscloth looks in your library ! And I admire your tenacity ! But , I ca n't help but wonder : With 2 small children and a house to run how do you ever find the time to tackle as many projects as you do ? It truly amazed me ! <p> First , let me say that I love the glass shelf tower , and ca n't wait to hear about your deal . Secondly , Kate , I am glad to hear you came out of this project with your sanity intact , and even though every muscle in your body is probably aching it looks fantastic ! <p> I read that another poster has a horror story about it as well.My mom installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not certain how well it was put up as the seams were popping up and the cats decided to use it as a scratching post ! I ended up taking it down and boy was it a nightmare ! However , my big problem was that it was hung over bare drywall- there was n't any paint under it . <p> I 'm positive that you 'll be enjoying your walls for years to come- they look gorgeous ! <p> I do n't know what space I could wallpaper , but you definitely make me want to try ! ; ) I love #10you sure have that goin ' on ! : ) It 's stunningdefinitely NOT what I picture when I think of wallpaper . I think you 're redefining it for me . : ) <p> No wallpaper for us , we recently moved into a house and after removing 4 layers of wallpaper ( the previous owners just kept putting it up over the last layer ) in the kitchen , I 'd say not in this lifetime . <p> You did an awesome job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's a real challenge ! I 've also had to REMOVE grass cloth wallpaper and that was an even bigger challenge ! I hope you will enjoy your room for years and years ! : ) <p> This grasscloth wallpaper is gorgeous and I ca n't believe you did it all by yourself ! However , you ask if I 'm tempted to do a wallpapering project now ? Ha ! I think I 'll just sit back and watch YOUR labors of love . : - ) <p> Oh my goodness , that looks absolutely gorgeous . Really stunning . But I think , having read your description and words of caution , attempting it would surely lead to tears so I 'll admire this one from afar . <p> That certainly was an ingenious way to wallpaper by your lonesome . Good job ! I have been tempted to use wallpaper and Mod Podge to to a high end look on the inside of a cabinet/side table . I 'm torn between a bright fushia or aqua design . Decisions , decisions . <p> I LOVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been wanting to try some wallpaper myself and am contemplating doing our small hallwayThanks for giving me the push ! Now let 's see if I get that accomplished while being on maternity leave ! hahaha <p> I 'm very impressed ! It looks wonderful love all the textures going on . I just love funky wallpaper , but my husband has forbidden me to use it in our house . And , seeing as I 'm not as industrious as you , I 'd probably have to make him help me , so it 's probably just paint for me : ( <p> thanks , centsational girl . i researched grasscloth for weeks and finally got the courage to hang my own after reading your account.it was totally do-ablethe stapling helped tremendously just to help give me a sense of security . by the last two panels i did n't  even need to use them . i redid an accent wall in a cream colored grasscloth. i should have gone with something a little darker , but the technical quality of the hanging looks great .. this was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave me the real insight i needed . <p> AHHHH ! I 'm in heaven ! Absolutely beautiful ! I always thought of wallpaper as " old-fashioned " but you have motivated me to try this technique . Love the calming colors that you chose in the room . Awesome job ! <p> I have saved pictures of your room in my inspirational file . The textures and colors are after my own heart ! But I 'm finding that grasscloth wallpaper cost so much , for a 16 ' x 12 ' x 9 ' room , it will cost me more than $1k for the wallpaper alone , did I calculate correctly ? Any advice is greatly appreciated ! <p> I wish I had seen this before trying to install my grasscloth in my bedroom several months ago ! ! ! I had one heck of a time with it . I tried the wallpaper paste , and it curled the grasscloth so badly ! ! I read online that pros generally use thumb tacks , so I tried that , but it was so slow getting each thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them in , the paper had bubbled , and some of the wallpaper paste had already dried . It was a huge mess . I actually ended up using.are you ready for this ? high strength spray adhesive ! ! It was a big huge stinky mess , but it worked . I never even THOUGHT about getting my staple gun out and using it instead of thumb tacks . That would have saved me a lot of headaches ! ! ! Oh well , I 'll know for next time . : ) <p> I just came across this post as I was looking into grass cloth wall paper . When I was looking at your photos I noticed your original wall looks like it has some texture . We just moved into a new house that has " knock out " drywall that looks a little like your picture . I have never lived in a house with this type of drywall and was curious ( if this is what you have ) how well the wall paper has held . I would really love to try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the textured wall underneath . <p> Thank you for the intro and the pictures , I really want to put grasscloth in my bedroom . Candice Olsen is the best I love her designs and now I do n't  feel so afraid of attempting to hang grasscloth . I 'm happy to have found this page you have given me the encouragement I needed . <p> First let me say that I love , love , love your website ! I have it saved to my favorites but other websites bring me back here as well , today it was decorpad with your photos of a DIY sea fan <p> Back to the subject , instead of hanging wallpaper which is so hard to do , why not use fabric instead ? At the moment I am looking for a good fabric for my bedroom wall since I am so sick of painting and want a different look . I just learned about the fabric starching process and cant wait to try it out ! Burlap would be very close to the grass cloth look , I have used it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it . Funny how times change , 10 years ago my clients were ripping this " dated " look from their walls or painting over it and now its hip again ! <p> Hello , oh how do I love your site ! ! ( adore your twitter button ) And what a great tutorial is this , I never hung wallpaper before and have always been scared to try , but your staple technique is awesome ! ! and might just make me try it myself . this is my first visit , I just wandered up here , but I 'll come back very soon to read all the other great stuff I see . <p> Hi ! Love your blog but for some reason Ive come across five of your postings already in where the pictures were not showing . Instead it is just a black block with a triangle and an exclamation inside . I guess I 'll have to use my imagination to imagine the before and final product ! : ' <p> Hi Eunice , I apologize for that , I addressed it earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several images I moved around and actually deleted , I 'll be rebuilding these posts shortly , promise ! Kate <p> I did n't  know that name of grasscloth wall treatment till seeing this post . Your room looks lovely but I 'm glad I definitely know this technique is not for me , those seams would drive me crazy , though I bet its less noticeable in person than in a photo ! <p> Yes , I love , love , love grasscloth . The individuality of it is a real plus for me . When you say you got under the grasscloth to paste the wall , how exactly did that look ? Did the grasscloth shrink after it was applied to the wall ? <p> As a professional wallpaper installer , I have reinvented the wheel at times when involved with a project in unfamiliar territory and have been able to live with the results , but after gaining more knowledge I realized how I may have tried another way . I suggest pasting the back of the grasscloth with a clear premixed adhesive using a 9 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 minutes , install . Try a sample with this technique , you may be surprised how easy it is . Letting a pasted paper sit for a bit will eliminate any problem with the air bubbles . Good on you for tackling such a difficult paper ! ! <p> Know this is an older post but just wanted to tell you your staple gun suggestion was particularly brilliant . Ours is very textured and you cant even see them . It really helped hold it in place while we got the seems aligned , etc . And ditto re using LOTS of paste . We put it on wall and on paper and it still was n't enough . <p> I 'm a professional paper hanger and I would like to share my way of hanging grasscloth . Use a damp sponge and wet the back of the strip of grasscloth . Book it into a loose roll . This allows the paper to relax and expand and will solve your bubble problem.While it is resting paste the wall with ready mix clear strippable , be generous but not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up the ladder and allow the entire strip to unfold so only the back side touches the wall . It will not be too heavy for one person . Place the top and stick it down . Go down the ladder and adjust the seam all the way down . Smooth the strip starting in the middle and work your way up then the middle and go down . If the edges of the roll are " boogered up " you can overlap the seams and inch and double cut a new seam with a straight edge and a razor blade . Remove the piece under the new seam . Wash off any paste that gets on the front with clean water . <p> I worked for a professional paper hanger when I lived in San Diego in the late 80s . We did track homes and installed various types of paper backed vinyls and papers . <p> The previous comment by the professional hangar is correct you should always prepaste your paper before trying to hang and let it rest . If you follow the directions and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not need the staples at all once it sets and is in place at the top , the paper will not move as long as you do not tug on it . The firs step is to establish your level lie vertically start about 1 ? away from a corner and make very LIGHT pencil lines be careful when following those lines because the past will allow the lead to leach into the glue and if you have a lighter paper or grasscloth you will end up with grey tint from the lead on your seams and you do not want that . A chalk line is worse because that chalk is very dusty and always leaches into the paste and into the seams so a light vertical level pencil line is the best I have found . <p> Also , double cutting is the key to perfect seams when hanging wallpaper if you master the art of a double cut using the best and sharpest blades , you will be very happy with the results of any paper hanging project . <p> Although I am not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best results often come from alternating the pieces top to bottom sort of like railroading the materials since grass-cloth is a random pattern and not a match . <p> I 'm surprised people still hang this ! We have it in 2 rooms of our home ( built in the 70s ) and we hate it ! Although ours is n't a nice gray , its more of a deep brown , making the room entirely too dark . <p> Hi Kate , I have been a regular to your awesome site for a long long time . I am thinking of installing the vinyl grasscloth . I have couple of questions . 1 . Did u have to prime the walls ? if yes , which primer did u use 2 . What type od adhesive did you use ? 3 . Do you still have the walalpaper hung or took it down ? if yes , was there any damage to the walls ? Would highly appreciate your response . Thanks , 23102 @qwx883102

The choices are numerous from high end stone products that come from a quarry to wood and recycled materials to the budget friendly laminates . Laminate has gotten a bad rap for a lot of the products from the past decades , but times have changed . I 'm a fan of laminate countertops in kitchens for these five reasons . <p> 1 . Low Maintenance &amp; Easy to Clean . When we were growing up my mom had ceramic tile countertops and I remember her saying she could n't wait for the day to rip them out . I also remember her scrubbing ( and making us scrub ! ) the grout to keep it clean and bright . Laminate offers an easy to clean solution with a household cleaner , a sponge , and some hot water , cleaning them is a breeze and maintaining them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Budget Friendly . Compared to stone and other solid surface countertops , laminate wins in the price war . Starting as low as $15 per square foot , they are far more affordable than quartz , marble , or granite which are often $50 to $100 per square foot depending on the material . You do have to be careful of sharp objects , abrasive cleaners , or extremely high heat . Here is a brief and interesting read about how laminates are made . <p> 3 . Stylish . Laminate countertops are looking so good ! The new patterns complement dark and light , painted and wood cabinets , but do you notice how they 're installed ? <p> When ordering your laminate surface consider not including the laminate backsplash seen with many of the older versions ( that little lip or apron that rides up on the wall ) . <p> Instead opt for a countertop that stops at the edge of the horizontal plane and choose a pretty backsplash that meets the countertop at the bottom of the wall like so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way baby ! I 'm weighing these three choices for a future project and leaning toward the White Carrara among these marble lookalike samples . I like that they 're also are available in bullnose and ogee edges for a more contemporary look . <p> 5 . Magazine Worthy . It 's not just high end solid stone or wood countertops that make it into magazines now . Stone lookalike laminates are candidates too ! Our budget shelter kitchen remodel from last year was impressive enough to make the pages of the August issue of BH&amp;G 's Kitchen + Bath Makeovers , check it out in print , we 're so excited to see it featured ! <p> You may recall it was Wilsonart who donated the Perla Piazza countertops to this good cause and their generosity is so greatly appreciated . Those are my five reasons why you should consider choosing laminate for your kitchen , a great look at a smart price . <p> How many of you have chosen laminate in your kitchen ? Are you happy you did ? <p> *This post sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I agree ! Laminate has come a long way from what it used to be . We recently installed a new laminate counter top in our kitchen and I could n't be happier with it . I wanted something light and clean and of course , budget friendly , so we ended up with a style that cost less than $300 for a 12 ' length . Unfortunately , it does have the backsplash ( had to have it with the option we chose to order ) but it really does n't  bother me too much . Also , have you seen the affordable premade pieces available at Lowes and Home Depot ? Super cheap ! <p> Wow , what a great post . I sure hope the stigma for laminate goes away . I have a bad glued laminate sheet with tile edging and really wanted the new Formica marble look with the ogee edge , but we are in the process of making one section from reclaimed wood because I needed it to be basically free . Once we get our island reshaped , though I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look great . What great examples , and not doing the back splash makes a huge difference ! <p> I 'm loving the new look of laminate I do love solid surface but one thing that always scares me is how hard they are ; I set a glass bowl down a little too hard and I 'm afraid that granite is going to break it . I love that laminate has a little give to it . <p> We ordered the Calcutta Marble laminate ( pictured above ) for our new build . We did a lot of shopping around , but the more popular stuff just was n't in our price range . Also , well have three kids under the age of two in less than a month , and I need something easy to clean ! <p> The guy at our countertop store actually said something to me about the popularity of granite etc " Granite has been really gaining popularity for the last 5-10 years , and its gorgeous , but people think that just getting granite countertops sealed keeps them clean . I think in another 5-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold issues in kitchens with these countertops , because people are n't  cleaning them properly . " He said that even with the sealants , a lot of stuff can still sneak through . <p> We went cheap when deciding on what finishes to put in our new build . We figured we would skip the builders marked up prices and put in what we want over the next few years as our budget allowed . I thought the first thing I would want to rip out would be those laminate countertops in both our kitchen and bathrooms , but its been so easy to clean that I 'm keeping it around until my kids are a little older . I love that I do n't  have to even think about the countertops at this point . <p> My only regret is not getting the laminate flush to the wall like in your examples . I wish I had known that was an option ! That ugly lip is keeping me from installing my backsplash because I do n't  want to have gap at the bottom of the wall when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about laminate in a while . I guess I did n't  realize it was making a comeback and the options have gotten better . We have ghetto old school laminate in our kitchen currently . Its not pretty . Were looking to remodel probably next year and having laminate as a possible low cost solution is awesome Thanks for sharing ! <p> The whole time I was reading this I was thinking , " I LOVE OUR WILSONART HD COUNTERTOPS ! " They look amazing and are no maintenance . We spent $700 on ours ( we have a LOT of counters . ) I can only imagine how prohibitively expensive granite would have been . <p> My only word of caution is about the beveled edge option . Since its basically separate pieces of laminate glued on to create that edge ( as opposed to a solid piece that would be " carved " into that shape ) , we are noticing some tiny chips and wear at the places where the pieces meet . I wish we would have gone for the bullnose edge . <p> We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is so realistic looking that you would think you have granite . There are so many patterns to choose from . We did buy it with the attached backsplash and then added a coordinating tile backsplash up to the bottom of the upper cabinets . We will be moving soon , and if the next house we buy and remodel needs countertops , we will use likely buy the HD laminate again . However , we might consider eliminating the attached backsplash and strictly go with the tile backsplash . However , we do like for now how it turned out . <p> Due to budget constraints I had laminate installed in a new build . I chose the Wilsonart White Carrara with my white cabinets and I love it . I heard that there have been problems with the new edges so I went with the standard edge . All that is needed is a splashy backsplash . Great post . I hope the stigma goes away ! <p> Love this post . I do n't  understand all the laminate hate out there . Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens ? We installed Wilsonart laminate in our kitchen 10 years ago and they have held up perfectly and still look great . We chose Graphite Nebula , a deep charcoal grey , almost black . We opted for the standard edge , clean and squared , which I think looks less characteristically laminate as compared to a curved or beveled edge . We did n't  install the little backsplash ledge and instead brought our white subway tile backsplash right down to the countertop and neatly caulked the seam . From a distance our counters look a little like soapstone . No regrets here . <p> I chose laminate countertops from Ikea when I remodelled my kitchen . I think they look totally contemporary and at a price point that just ca n't be beat . I like the clean edge and that there is no backsplash on them . A word of caution , the Ikea laminate countertops are thicker than other laminate counters , be sure to factor that in when buying faucets ; mine just barely made it to the downpipe . Oops . <p> We had old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new house . The difference in price between stone and good formica was not very big on the mortgage time-scale , plus we would have to get integrated sink with formica which I did not like . So we got granit . What a pain to clean ! It absorbs grease like a sponge and after two years we have darker areas where the grease from stove splashed and greasy spoons were left My friends say its barely noticeable , but I KNOW its there and I CAN see it . So yes , you are right , laminate is better . At least I got vinyl floor , which is so much easier to clean than tile ! : ) <p> I have 17 year old off white laminate that has held up extremely well . I clean houses for a living and granite shows hard water spots and loses its shine . When I replace I 'm going with laminate again . I love all the new colors and the back splash . <p> I 'm so glad I 'm not the only one who appreciates laminate countertops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backsplash changes the look for the better . I had never thought about it , but what a difference ! I wonder if the splash can just be cut off of those prefab countertop pieces at Home Depot to achieve the same look ? <p> What a timely post ! We just had our new Wilsonart HD laminate countertops installed last week , and I truly couldnt be happier with them . I chose the Carrara Santorini because I liked the grey veining more than the subtle Calcutta Marble . Just like you said , I opted to not add the backsplash and just had my white subway tile put in today . I 've already had people shocked to find out that its not real marble . The rounded edge gives the illusion of marble , and then you only have the one seam along the side . I 'm so happy with it ! <p> Twenty years and counting with my laminate countertops ! Yes there are a couple of slice marks in it but twenty years , 4 kids and a hubby , I would n't use anything else on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( my hubby has it on his office desk top ) <p> We chose laminate when we renovated our kitchen and I never regretted it . The countertop looks expensive and requires zero maintenance . We actually chose to keep the " lip " backsplash that came with the countertop and I personally feel it actually ads to the look . <p> When we did a kitchen remodel a few years ago , we put in a beautiful Peacock Green ( almost black ) granite . Biggest mistake EVER ! It is such a pain in the butt to clean ! You cant just swipe it with a sponge because it looks terrible unless you also dry it . Its like trying to clean a mirror with a wet sponge.streaks galore . Mine are " factory " sealed which is a plus , but you need to use a special granite cleaner , and wipe them dry . I hate them ! and they were SO expensive ! <p> Wow , this article couldnt of come at a better time for me . We just finished ripping out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total gut on the main floor of our old farm house . I did n't  know you could have laminate w/o the rolled up back . You have just added $$$ to my budget ! Thank you so very much . Its getting harder and harder to find ways to cut things off the want list . <p> My husband and I remodeled our kitchen about three years ago and went with laminate . We have a lot of counter space , so even with the laminate it was 1600.00 ! We chose a medium soapstone and used marble subway tile for the backsplash . It looks great and its easy to live with . No regrets at all ! <p> Another anti-granite post here . Thankfully we did n't  pay for ours they were already in the home we purchased . When the time comes to do so , I will happily rip them out and replace them with something more functional . I am really excited to see how far laminate has come . <p> Our kitchen is gutted to the studs as I type . Were DIYing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the weekends when the hubs is off work . Were on week 8 . With three kids . Kill me now . The point of my mini novel is , our counters are payed for and we went with the Wilsonart White Carrera , no backsplash . I 'm so excited to see them installed , I could pee myself . If you 're so inclined , I do an update of where were at once a week , and you can see our progress here : LONG ... <p> This post could not be more perfect timing ! I just discovered on local blogs/Pinterest Formica fx Calcutta Marble ! i was blown away by the pics on LONG ... That this was Formica ! As soon as I read this article I ran to my closest Home Depot to sadly find only a sample in a 2+2 inch sample chip . Do you know where they feature this in a showroom Or larger scale sample ? I also am confused about comments above with the edging options . What is the difference between bullnose and ogee edge ? Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullnose edging having issues . <p> We put in beautiful laminate countertops in our kitchen with an integrated sink . The are beautiful and no maintenance . I 'm too busy to worry about taking care of an item in my kitchen that serves so many purposes . The only thing I wish is that I 'd have chosen not to have the backsplash and tiled . New countertops and flooring were achieved in that renovation and I have never felt like my choices were anything less than wonderful . I just put new Wilsonart countertops and sinks in my two bathrooms and they are truly spectacular . One bathroom has a backsplash the other does not and is tiled . I am very pleased with the look of both . I feel I can change out my countertops a little more often when I have n't spent a fortune . I like that . <p> We had builders grade laminate in our last home . It must have been the cheapest of the cheap because under the edge was exposed particle board and around the edges , especially over the dishwasher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also chipped off on some of the edges leaving that particle stuff exposed . I swore I 'd never use it again but you have changed my mind . I am currently buying a 100 year old house and need to remodel the kitchen which was updated , probably in the 80s . I think the new laminate is the way to go . Have you heard of the particle board problem before ? and how is that issue addressed now ? Thanks for a great post ! <p> When we had our kitchen done a few years ago I was n't too keen on the idea of laminate . However , after reluctantly going along with it I now LOVE it . Very low maintenance and budget friendly couldnt agree more . <p> I agree ! We installed granite countertops in our last house just before we put it on the market to sell . I 'm so glad we were able to try it out before building our new home . My husband and I broke 3 glasses in a short period of time setting them down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really surprising . Between that and the fear of acidic foods , maintenance , etc , told us quickly that we were not granite people . And , I think I may be one of the few people on earth who did n't  yearn for it anyway . I like it fine in many other traditional look kitchens , but for me , the pattern always felt overpowering . Still , I felt like I had to apologize for preferring laminate . People looked at me like I must not have good taste . : -D <p> I love laminate . We have it in the kitchen and soon in all four baths . So easy to keep clean and tidy . We have some kind of faux stone in all the baths , and that stuff is a major , major pain to keep up . Ca n't stand it ! <p> We put in new counters almost 2 years ago and went with a recycled glass/quartz/granite combo . We love the look of it , but in hindsight , I wish we would have spent the money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really hate my cabinets and no matter how I paint them , they 're still 1971 cabinets . We spent almost $5k on the counters , so ripping them out and starting over is not an option . Well likely put new doors on the cabinets in the near future . That might help <p> We got laminate in our last kitchen because of cost and easy care , plus not breaking things dropped on it ( we have young kids ) . However , you can easily spend a lot on laminate once you go beyond the cheapest ones , so you need to be aware of that . <p> We had issues with not having flat walls , and the installer does n't  scribe the edges the way they do with solid surfaces , so while we lived with a gap between counter and wall we installed the 2 inch thing when we sold the house . <p> We did n't  realise that because we had dark counters ( oiled soapstone ) youd see the white at the very base of the laminate along each seam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do a curved or ogee edge . Definitely try to find an installed sample to look at before you order . <p> Oh , while you 're talking about materials I 'd love to see a roundup of soft kitchen floor coverings . Our house is 90 years old and the wooden floors would be impossible to match ( mostly because of the gaps ! ) , plus I like the softness of a vinyl floor on my feet . Are vinyl and cork the only options ? How do the various options look hard up against hardwoods of a different colour ? Are there low VOC vinyl alternatives ? <p> I used to have ceramic tile counters and I hated them ! We had a water leak and had to redo our kitchen . I chose laminate and we save enough cash to get new floors for my dining room ! I 'm showing this post to my hubby who is skeptical about the laminate . <p> My 28 year old house has laminate counter tops and they have held up well . Were currently giving the kitchen a freshening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited all these years for a nicer kitchen and desperately want an undermounted sink . I think the solid surface has the benefit of being easy to clean , easy to repair and for me the most important , undermounted sink . We are n't  planning on moving in the next 10 years so I 'm not worried about resale value any thing I pick will be the dreaded " dated " by the time we sell . <p> When we purchased our 1910 home , somewhere along the line , someone decided to do , not one , but Two layers of ( ugly ) tile for the countertops . So we ripped it all out , and being on a tight , tight budget , headed to home depot to see what we could find , and we found a great laminate top that has a black and brown granite look to it . It mainly looks black , which matched perfectly . It cost us about $300 to redo our countertops . We ended up purchasing the one with the backsplash ( that 's all they had ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfully ) Everyone that sees it likes our granite tops , and are impressed when we tell them its laminate = ) <p> We have 1966 Laminate now , and I do n't  want that again . : P But granite , marble or any other natural stones have been out of the question ever since I read about how fragile they are . Depending on time and budget , I might consider laminate or manmande stone . Well see when we get there . <p> Thank you for this post . I have a BA in Interior Design and get irritated with the fad of granite , especially for people that I *know* will not seal it as they are supposed to . I think laminate is a great , cost effective way to go . <p> Great timing ! I put a bid on a house yesterday and know I 'll have to replace the kitchen right away ( wish me luck ! ) . My Realtor told me not to put laminate in , but I " m not worried about resale and I keep thinking of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beluga . I love this kitchen , its practical for a family , and I will probably shamelessly copy as much as I can : LONG ... <p> I whole-heartedly agree with your reaons on laminate . I remodeled my kitchen a few years back and chose laminate because in my neighborhood , spending the $$$ on granite would NOT fetch a higher price . ( I am in a middle class nidhgborhood . ) Also I know I 'd want to change down the road and wouldnt because I 'd feel guilty for the money I spent on granite . And as for that backsplash , I let someone talk me into getting it . What a mistake ! a ) It cost me more for that , and b ) something extra to clean ! Also I like bull nose edge or curved corners . Its softer and kitchens have a lot of hard edges . <p> Dear Kate- Im thrilled that you tackled the subject of Laminate for counters ! ! ! I 'm ready to redo my counter and it is a horrible brown checked " THING " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and I want it to be perfect . Of course money is a factor , but the Wilsonart is really , really , good looking . Would you be so kind as to let me know what was the name of the Wilsonart in the three pics that you used ? I tried to click on them , hoping they would tell me , but it wo n't . Also yours look wonderful ! Were you afraid to pick such a light color ? THANKS- Catherine <p> New butcher block laminate ! My sample arrived in todays mail so I was very excited to see this post . The laminate is Wilsonart Premium Laminate that looks like butcher block . Its a new product for Fall 2013 . I got a sample of the dark brown ( Old Oak Mill ) and they also have a lighter color . Its fantastic looking ! The thought of a no-maintenance butcher block look-alike is very exciting . <p> Yes , Laminate has come a long way . I used it in my laundry room and love it . I wonder if homeowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that look ? Then they could put a nice tiled backsplash . I guess someone who is thinking of replacing it could try it and see if it works : ) <p> Hi Stephanie , I 'm curious to know if that can be done too , I suspect it might be a huge mess and leave a larger gap than can be covered by tile , usually those aprons are an inch thick as I recall , but if anyones done it successfully , I 'd love to know ! <p> Laminate is the way to go . It comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns . Its the most inexpensive material available . When you get tired of a pattern , you can change it without breaking the bank . <p> My husband predicts a day all the landfills have granite that people are tired of . He says you 'll be able to walk into any house with granite countertops and say , " This is to two thousand teens . " <p> The only thing I do n't  really like about laminate is that you cant use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks in your photos above look like they are level with the countertop . How is that done ? <p> I 've lived with almost every type of countertop : Tile , limestone , granite , Corian , laminate , even contact paper ( seriously ! ) . All have pluses and minuses . My least favorite besides the contact paper was the tile , and my most favorite was actually some vintage Formica with gold glitter in it ! That stuff was amazing . Right now we have granite and Ive broken so many dishes . We did less expensive cabinets and more expensive countertops during our remodel a few years ago but if I had to do it again I 'd go with laminate counters and better cabinetry . Live and learn ! <p> Hi I too love laminate , but I live in an area where our drinking water has a lot of minerals . We installed white Wilsonart laminate in our bathroom and there is a constant mineral stain around the faucet handles . If you bleach it , it gets worse . Do not bleach your laminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry cleaner or CLR ( Calcium Lime and Rust ) product . If anyone else has problems with hard water , please do n't  get white laminate ! If anyone had a solution to remove the yellowed mineral stains , please reply . <p> When we moved into our teeny 1940s house , we inherited solid-but-sad wood cabinets and a countertop made out of plywood covered with contact paper . Eek ! A few coats of cream paint made the cabinets look great , and we were able to find a prefab laminate countertop at our local home store for less than $150 . We briefly debated going with a different material , but it would be foolish to chose natural stone in our neighborhood ( we 'd never recoup the money if we sell ) . Our laminate countertops were really budget-friendly , and they 're tough , easy to clean , and look great . Love them ! We saved so much money on the cabinets and counters that we were able to redo the flooring and tile our backsplash . For less than $500 , we have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little house , and is really practical . I couldnt be happier . <p> For an even better look , omit the backsplash and get a " D " edge doubled . A regular D edge is about 1 ? deep so by doubling it you will have a substantial 2 ? lip on the front of your counter . Balances the height of base cupboards and , if you 're using a stone/granite laminate look-alike it mimics the look even better . <p> A few people have posted asking if they can just cut off the backsplash on the preform purchased , stocked laminate tops from HD and Lowes . The answer is no and here is why : if from the back edge of the backsplash to the front is 1 piece of laminate . If you cut the backsplash off from the top , you are left with a chunk of your counter not covered by the laminate ( and probably do n't  have a pretty line either ) . If you cut off the backsplash running the blade parallel to the backsplash , the counter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely would n't even meet the front of your cabinet . If you do n't  want the backsplash , custom order without it . <p> I like reading blogs about renovation on a budget ! And the photos of this post of laminate countertops in the kitchen are amazing ! <p> I got a few questions about laminate countertops in the bathroom countertops though . My small kitchen has Italian porcelain tiles we installed few years back and I love how it looks and its so easy to maintain . However , my bathrooms have cultured marble countertops with undermount sinks . There are black waters pots on the countertops , and " orangey " circles around where the old faucets were ( we changed the faucets ) , also the sink in one of the bathroom sinks is all scratched and stained and I simply cant keep it clean . : ( <p> Now I have a baby , I do n't  think I can do any tile countertops without help . But I 'm on a budget , so I am thinking if its possible to install laminate countertops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know the durability of laminate countertops in bathrooms ( havent had it in bathrooms before ) and if its impossible as a DIY project . <p> Anyone has any insight on this ? I really cant spend that much money on these countertops and sinks and therere 3 ( 36 ? , 60 ? and 72 ? ) . I am just so tired of " trying " to clean up without success . Hope someone can help . ANY ideas are welcome ! Thanks for reading ! <p> A few years later &amp; I just found this and am so glad . In process of buying a a cool vintage 80s house with an old kitchen and crooked brown , tile countertops . Have been debating doing feather lite concrete over them but a great laminate sounds like a much happier option . Glad I found this post ! <p> I know this is long after your original post , but love the laminate featured in the second picture in your article ( white cabinets and teapot on store , bowl on counter ) . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking everywhere for something like this but have not see this . Thanks ! <p> I briefly browsed through the comments and did n't  see this question . If its already been asked , I do apologize ! <p> The countertop looks fabulous . Was this laminate built on a substrate with the typical , standard measurements ? It actually looks a little bit thinner than normal which I prefer . Ive run across this before and would love to know whether you customized yours by asking for a thinner substrate . Using a thinner substrate tends to help laminate counters not " scream laminate . " Three centimeters ( a bit thinner than standard ) achieves more of a stone-like thickness and just plays a trick on the eye by not looking like EVERY single laminate countertop that youve ever seen before ! We are about to install WilsonArt laminate with no backsplash . And although I know that we want it built on a thinner substrate , I 'm having a hard time finding an installer who knows anything about this . So I would lovvvvve to hear your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , thank you ! <p> I am remodeling my kitchen right now and looking for counter top solutions . I had n't  even considered laminate counter tops because I have always like the look of granite kitchen counter tops . But it looks like they have similar looks depending on the pattern . I think that it is good to look at the different options that are available for remodeling purposes . <p> What a great post ! We need to replace our laminate countertops that are 16 years old and installed when we built our house . They were all we could afford . My husband wants granite or ceramic and I want to stick with the laminate . They have held up well , so why change . I think I have just stumbled upon my argument ! Thanks ! <p> We sold our house this past July . It was 17 years old , and still had its original white laminate counters . They were in excellent shape and I 'm NOT easy on stuff . Thay house sold in 3 hours and had two offers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in Formica counters that look like granite with an ogee edge in the kitchen . The bathrooms have granite in a tan color with speckles . I hate it . It already has darkened areas from water . And its so cold and hard ! We decided to add a peninsula to our kitchen , and got the same Formica that was already here . I love it . I am sick of all the snobs who only want granite . They can keep it . My dream counters would be sparkly quartz , but if I cant have that l will stick with laminate . Its so easy to take care of . And even though I do n't  try to pass it off as granite , a relative was here for Christmas , and she actually sat at the counter and touched it and asked how they matched my beautiful granite when they added the peninsula . I did n't  want her to feel stupid so I did n't  say anything . She lives in a huge , expensive house that does have granite , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were up to me I 'd live in a house with a 50s kitchen and boomerang counters with the metal edge ! I love laminate and I 'm not ashamed ! <p> Laminate countertops are getting much closer to a high end countertop , but for our clients we still install granite or quartz with most of the kitchens and bathrooms that we renovate . I will say that I have seen a couple that are very sharp looking counters ! Great article ! 23102 @qwx883102

I have about 2/3 of a can left , yay ! ! <p> Now is a good time to secure all your branches together with floral wire ( should have done it before I sprayed the faux snow , not after ! ! ! ) <p> I added a few wintery springs found at the local craft store . . . <p> - <p> Then some glittered pinecones and blue ornaments for a pop of color ! <p> There 's my whimsical wintery white wreath . . . <p> - Total cost = $20 dollars ! <p> - <p> If you want to know how I hang my wreath , I use a trusty 3M hook you can see it up close if you check out last years welcome wreath . <p> Gorgeous . Really lovely ! ! I 'm loving white/silver this year too . Matter of fact , I 'm working right now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel this year . One of the ornaments I 'm using keeps falling down . Good times . : - ) shaunna <p> GORGEOUS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Love the look ! <p> Just beautiful Kate ! I too love the faux snow ! ! Be careful using it indoors on your regular tree , it can be flameable . I too would love a tree covered in it , but have been a bit leary after reading the can . We used it on wreaths , twigs and pincecones last year . <p> Hi Kate ! I used the snow because it falls like snow on the branches and up close is n't shiny like paint , more powdery . But white spray paint on branches is equally as glam , in fact , I 'll be using spray paint on other branches this season . Thanks ! ! <p> Beautiful ! I 've never done wreaths much because of the storage issue do you have any tricks ? You must have many wreaths do you store them all together ? Do they need a little fine tuning each year when you bring them out ? <p> Hello Brooke ! Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found a few years ago in an after Christmas sale .

This evening I 'm so wiped out , I spent yesterday celebrating St. Patrick 's Day as any self respecting Irish girl does ! I had a really great time with a group of good friends . Today I took a four hour self defense course , oh man was that intense , but in a good way . It 's the second course I 've taken in the past year and I can not recommend them enough , I always leave those classes with knowledge and tactics that I know will help keep me safe in a bad situation . Take one in your town ladies , you 'll be so glad you did ! <p> Tomorrow I 'm headed out of town for a few days to spend some time with my older brother who is remodeling his kitchen for resale , he needs my help picking out finishes so I 'm taking a short road trip and giving him some ideas . Hope you all had a great St. Patrick 's Day too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holland Avenue Home kitchen . And so inspired that Avery went with the Annie Sloan chalk paint , small warts and all . I 've debated this issue for four years . This is my forever home in 55+ Sun City West , Arizona and at my age , I hope and pray I still have a good 15 years or so to live here and I truly believe in doing what makes me happy and also in the stupidity of doing something for resale value when I have no plans to sell and anything I 'd do now on trend would be outdated in a few years anyway . Also , I 'm on a limited budget and my biggest project is new flooring throughout my 1350 sf home ( thanks loads for your inspiration with the luxury vinyl plank flooring my two sample planks get moved around my house regularly and I love the color and appearance and the feel under my feet . Hoping that happens this year . Redid the lighting in my kitchen with my brilliant brothers help last September . The kitchen cabinets are left 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabinets is beyond my ability and I 'd have to hire painters but chalk painting could be something my brother and I could accomplish on his return visit this year . The holdback , of course , is that annoying little voice that says " but you 'll never sell or get your price if you do n't  redo " to which , of course , I answer that even if I did " redo " to a dream white kitchen , the next owners would probably gut whatever I did and totally replace the 32-year-old plus 5 , 10 or 15 years cabinets anyway . Ill be investigating the durability of chalk painted kitchen cabinets over several years because Averys kitchen is beautiful . Thanks for providing great inspiration again yet again ! <p> I love Averys kitchen makeover ! Incredible difference . I applaud her hardware choice , too !

@@99057718 @3257718/ <h> Styling Traditional Wood Furniture <p> By Kate Riley May 11 , 2015 <p> I received an email from Sarah with a design dilemma , she like many has inherited a unique piece of furniture , it belonged to her grandmother and recently was restored by her father to its original wood state . Sarah wants to keep the heirloom buffet in her home , it has sentimental value , but her dilemma is how to create a stylish look with this piece that sits in her dining room . <p> Personally , I love seeing wood pieces like this in a home , they add richness and warmth , and mixing pieces from different periods makes a home feel collected over time . The use of traditional wood furniture like this can be a purposeful placement by antique lovers , or a much treasured heirloom like Sarah 's that a family wants to keep . <p> In this case my first instinct is to change the wall color to anything other than brown with fresh paint or perhaps a wall treatment , and add a large scale mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something sleeker like these and place a large potted plant or tree to the right . <p> To style it there is so much she can do with decorative accents to create a layered appealing look . Here are a few examples I found where both bloggers and designers have tackled this same issue and styled traditional wood furniture in a contemporary way . <p> Below a gilded mirror and trio of classic blue and white chinoiserie accents ( two vases , one lamp ) introduce shape and color . Books and a smaller work of abstract art balance out the center of the arrangement . <p> Simplicity is another approach , using a large scale mirror anchored by a pair of lamps with modern black shades . Prop another smaller piece of art in front and rotate a bowl of fruit or vase of fresh flowers weekly . <p> Do n't overlook the opportunity to make a statement on the wall , beautiful grasscloth wallpaper and a glossy bamboo pagoda mirror add panache and a pair of ginger jar lamps introduces a lovely blue and white pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traditional chest , and an orchid in a polished silver champagne bucket adds an elegant touch . Above this chest hangs a mercury leaf mirror flanked by two gold leaf sconces , on top a smaller piece of abstract art and stack of books balances the vignette . <p> What 's happening with the furniture around the traditional piece can also influence the styling . Below Tobi does an masterful job of layering blue accents in the form of books , artwork , and a lamp on this wood bedside chest , playing off the tones in the fabric on the headboard and wallpaper . <p> In Jana 's great room she styled her bookcase simply with varied book placement and floating artwork , but also notice the use of contemporary textiles to balance the traditional furniture in the room . <p> This antique chest was modernized with lucite knobs then surrounded by a collection of art , and how fresh the space feels with that fabulous pink tufted chair off to the side . The styling on top is eclectic and fun , mixing a whimsical cachepot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments <p> I just swapped out my nightstand with something similar ! Its been at my moms house for as long as I can remember and just recently had been sitting in her garage so I saw my chance ! I love all of the styles you showed with this , makes it really easy to recreate ! <p> Thanks for this post ! Although I love the current trend in painted furniture , I love traditional , fine wood , furniture . I have several pieces that I will never be able to paint , no matter how much I might sit and imagine them painted . It is good to see someone showing how these pieces can enhance your home . <p> Love the addition of antique wood pieces mixed in with other items of furniture . As you said it gives a home a collected look and our familys history is one of the few things that are unique to us and our homes . <p> The inherited piece is lovely and your photo examples are all very nice but not a single one of them has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the back board can be removed and safely stored , leaving a cleaner , yet still beautiful chest . It might be easier for some people to live with or style case goods like this if they are simplified with that one alteration . <p> Nancy is absolutely right . The backboard , although lovely , does add to the traditional look of the piece . However , if Sarah is unable/unwilling to remove it , she can still benefit from some of these vignettes , in particular the ones which showcase artwork on the top , especially if she uses the backboard to rest the art . <p> I 'm not usually drawn to dark wood pieces , but these rooms have shown quite effectively how they can be modernized and quite beautiful in their own right . ( My ocd personality is dying to reach in the mark ashby room and move that dresser to the left a few inches ! ) <p> Super timely post , Kate ! Im having fun working with some old treasures and some new ones which will keep their original colors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help tie the room together . There are some great inspiration pics here . <p> Definitely a new wall color is the first step . Then , as others pointed out , if Sarah could and was open to it , remove the backboard . On my monitor , it looks a different color wood from the rest of the chest and a somewhat busier style so it might well have been added later . I think the chest would be much more of a standout without it . However , if it ca n't be removed , I agree with Doreen about creating a vignette with a large mirror and/or pix to hide it some of the inspiration pix above do it very well . I hope Sarah will send her " new do " to you and you 'll post the results . <p> I have almost nothing but traditional wooden antiques that were given to me by my mother . Or I had it made for me before 2000 . I can be done . It makes me sad that so many want to paint everything white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger on what was off but you called it . . . too much brownfloors , furniture , walls . Do you analyze and think about it or do you instinctually grasp the problem , a la Blink by Malcolm Gladwell ? I think there 's an art to putting words to instant impressions . I find overthinking makes the impression go away and then I 'm fuddling around with my head and not my instinct . <p> The back piece is the glory of the whole piece ! Either paint the walls a light color or maybe a large piece of art or a picture with a lot of whit to fill the wall with light . The small picture is too tiny and does n't  have enough weight to compliment the piece . Then come up with a vignette for the top . It really does n't  need a lot of pieces on it , just the right ones in scale and color ! <p> I guess I 'm the only one who likes the backerboard . : ( I think its what make the piece unique , but I 'm also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With imagination and style it can be done and provide something other than the cookie-cutter images we seem to see on every blog . I grew up in Belgium and old furniture is mixed with modern pieces as a matter of course , but with panache . It also looks as if the rest of her furniture is traditional as well . <p> I agree 100% with Kates instincts ! However , also removing the backboard will help immensely ( I 've done this and stored it away for keepsake ) . I love mixing old with new , as it adds character to your home . 23102 @qwx883102

I 'm busy busy busy with a very cool new project I 'm working on , I 'm very excited to share it with you , that 's coming next week . Meanwhile , you may recall this $7 thrift store chair I scored a few weeks ago . Well lah dee dah , look at her now ! <p> She was all by her lonesome at a local thrift store and I adored that scroll back and figured she 'd be a great piece in my neighbor 's daughter 's room . Now she 's all fancied up with some paint , new fabric , and ( ooh la la ) gold leaf on that gorgeous scroll . It 's the perfect little desk chair for this space under the window . The room is mostly white and turquoise , so we were going for a dash of glam , and as always metallics will do the trick this time it was gold leaf . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cover Stain . ( You can see how gorgeous this chair would be in white too ! ) <p> Next came the water based enamel paint a popular color around here since I painted this blue bureau with the same . ( Benjamin Moore 's Thunderbird ' ) . <p> Next came time to add the gold leaf , I used this product found at my local craft store . I learned long ago that simple spray adhesive works great for applying silver or gold leaf ( see this lamp and this chair ) . <p> With the spray , you do n't have to wait for a brush on adhesive to get tacky that I love , but you have to tape off the surround sections where you painted . Or I could have just applied the gold leaf first , but well , I did n't , so I just taped the surround off to avoid the spray adhesive . <p> Apply a small amount to your first section . <p> With one sheet of gold leaf at a time , simple press and carefully peel away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to your piece . <p> Applying gold leaf is a flaky messy business and sometimes a little frustrating , especially when you 've got crevices and corners . With patience you can eventually get it into all the cracks . But I 'm impatient , so I cheat sometimes . <p> I use this . <p> I 've had this Liquid Leaf in my stash since this gold table project and Matthew uses it to achieve the gold leaf look too . It 's stinky so beware , but it works great for giving you the look of gold leaf without all the trouble of actually applying gold leaf . <p> Here 's the detail up close . I like that subtle crinkly texture of real gold leaf but you can only see it when you 're about 2 feet away ( or less ) so if you could care less about texture , just skip the gold leaf process entirely and use the Liquid Leaf paint instead , it will give you the same look without the time , expense ( or headache ) of applying gold leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or craft paint too , why not ? <p> The seat was reupholstered too I 'll share some tips on that soon . <p> The gilded detail adds a touch of glam to this transformed chair , and it 's a big hit in my neighbor 's daughter 's room , the perfect addition to her feminine space . <p> By the way , for anyone who 's curious , the rug is the Espana from Home Decorators , and they have several colors in that circle pattern ! <p> . 23100 @qwx883100 <h> 65 comments <p> it looks gorgeous ! how was the craft bond adhesive ? i used the one that the craft store sold with the leafing and it worked well at first but as it got to the end of the can it seemed to not be as sticky . it was n't empty , just not as sticky . <p> Super cute !

Its stunning . <p> Hi Shelby , that 's my friends daughters room , the rug is 3 1/2 x 5 1/2 but I think the sizes vary based on the space itself , not just the desk . In this room , its being used just as an accent under the desk so its proportional but for a larger desk and chair , I think it probably looks best to have both the desk and chair sitting on the rug , even when the chair is pulled out . Hope this helps ! <p> Kate , Love the chair and the lovely treatment you gave it . I love the glam of the gold .

If using brush on adhesive , you can easily cover any places you missed with a bit of adhesive and small piece of gold leafing . Seems like traditional gold leafing has black or red paint underneath and its desirable to have some of the paint color showing through . But that info . is from YEARS back . I 'm older ! Vicki <p> Oh Kate I forgot something ! If it is true " gold " leafing it should have either brush on or spray on oil based varnish of some variety . Nothing water based . In time the true gold will tarnish from fingerprints or moisture . Vicki <p> Kate , its just darling . So funny . . . I came over from Chris blog where she said everything you touch turns to gold .

I love Chris blog , so happy to be her guest . I use that spray paint gun handle all the time , it really helps distribute evenly because your fingers are n't  cramping up above , they 're pulling a trigger and I think it makes for a better application . Clearly mines had some use ! Theyre only a few bucks in the paint department and worth every penny . Kate <p> So happy to come across your site . Never thought I would do metalics/gold yet you have totally inspired me with your blues , silvers , grays and gold . My neighbors have come to hate me as I become a spray painting queen .

The home has plain Jane builder grade tubs and I 'm considering a fresher look with a freestanding tub . I 've never installed one in any of our homes but I 've stayed in a hotel rooms with a claw foot tub and the look has always been a favorite . <p> I ca n't deny the convenience of a sunken drop in tub with a tile or solid surface surround for placing soaps , candles , towels , etc , but my heart goes pitter patter for a freestanding version in the traditional claw foot and more modern shapes . Swoon ! <p> There are architectural considerations with this choice , most require a floor mount tub filler which is pricier fixture and definite splurge , but I just love how a freestanding tub opens up a bathroom space and makes it feel less cramped . <h> 18 comments <p> We are planning to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a cottage on 10acres we feel a claw foot tUb is more in keeping with the style while adding a bit of glamour . I plan to have one with a black exterior , white interior . <p> I have a cast iron claw foot tub in my current home and I absolutely LOVE the look but because I 'm short its difficult to get in and out of . The new place I 'm moving into has what is called a " Soft Tub " with jets and I 'm dying to try that one out . <p> We are replacing a standard tub w/a clawfoot tub in my mothers old house . The rooms will be a charcoal color with gray streaked marble floors . The tub itself will be Radiant Orchid on the outside with silver feet . That 's the plan , anyway . If we get tired of the color , we can always repaint it . <p> I think the look is so pretty if it is n't your primary bathroom , but I had one and I HATED it . I was so excited to redo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have shower curtains all the way around , they attack you while you 're trying to wash your hair.theyre good for baths but if you have to use them to shower , it sucks . My parents house had a freestanding tub downstairs and a shower upstairs , which was great ! <p> I love traditional clawfoot tubs ! Being Half -Japanese I also love traditional Japanese bathroom in which you scrub-up , shower , getting fully cleansed ( in an area seperated from the tub ) before entering herbal batwaterin a traditional cypress soaker tub . My dream someday is to combine the traditional Japanese bathroom style w/the twist of a very traditional clawfoot tub as my soaker tub ! I 've sketched out many MANY a design of what that future bathroom will look like when I finally own my own home . Thanks for posting the soaker tubs ! They 're ALL lovely , but my dream bathroom would somehow pull-of the fusion of two *very* different bathroom styles while retaining the *very*different traditional styles ( I even dream of incorporating a **25;953;TOOLONG ! ) <p> P.S. @Wendy- Albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very confusing as my mama is just shy of 5ft , lol ! ) If your castiron clawfoot tub no longer works for you , I would glady pick it up . =*=I already know my " dream home " ( first home of my own , being an U.S. Army wife , &amp; before that a " military brat " , never having lived anywhere longer than a couple of yrs my entire life ) will have to be a " fixer-upper " designed/ updated lovingly by much DIY , &amp;scouting deep deals , salvage , etc . Which , do n't  get me wrong , I 've been happily looking fwd to the process for many years ! Well , if you 'd like to help me get started ( I have a couple of treasured pieces in storage Ive been saving for the big day I can FINALLY imprint myself on my own space after years of military housing ) , maybe I can be your excuse to go ahead &amp;invest get that new tub you so desire ! =*= <p> OOPS , sorry , I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving into a new place which has your dream tub already ! Good for you , &amp; congrats on your new home ! =*= I 've heard one can find cast iron clawfoot tubs at Restores , salvage stores , etc . A great part of the fun for me will be the " hunting " process ! ! =*= <p> If you are planning the house for re-sale , I would stick to a traditional tub with the surround . Although the tubs in the pictures you posted are beautiful , they are in bathrooms that have been highly designed ( not that yours wont be highly designed ) that have the space and the architecture for it . If you 're renovating a traditional smaller-sized house , I would stick with traditional tub . The resale will be better for you . There 's a house on the market here ( standard size house for average people ) that is not selling because the people took out the built in soaker tub and put a claw foot caddy-cornered in its space . Its very awkward looking and does n't  fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure with your great eye for style , yours wont look awkward , but I 'm just saying . I would n't buy a house with a claw foot or free standing tub . <p> I love the idea of the orchid colored bathtub I may have to rethink my black one , as you say it can always be reprinted . I would disagree about choosing a standard tub for resale . Our house actually has no bathtub at all . While it was top of our list of renovations ( ahead of a new kitchen even ) it did n't  put us off buying the house . It did factor in the price we offered . However , I note a lot of people are removing tubs and putting in big shower spaces . Ok , rambling somewhat I know , but my point is if a house is well styled buyers will either like the style or not . If I had found a house with a claw foot bath tub it would have swung the deal . As it was a house without any tub at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tub is a small thing in the scheme of things . <p> When we moved into our house , one of the bathrooms had a clawfoot tub crammed in a corner . It was very hard to clean under and impossible to clean behind and mold built up on the walls touching the tub . My kids also lost a couple of rubber ducks and hair ties under there . It had an overhead shower and the curtains were never sufficient to keep the water contained . Plus I did n't  like the cluttered look of the shower hardware hanging from the ceiling . But we did love the tubs deep size . So when we remodeled , we removed the claw feet and had the tub sunk into a tiled surround . I opted not to put in a shower , but just have a shower hose attachment . The tiled surround also gives more space for bathing and decorative items . I would n't advise anyone to put in a free-standing tub unless they had plenty of room to give ample margins around it . And you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees to clean under a tub , do n't  install a clawfoot . They are also extremely heavy , so you have to make sure your bathroom is structurally able to handle one ( plus the water weight ) . <p> I absolutely love them all . Our home is over 150 years old . We remodeled the lower bathroom to a large shower only with no regrets after 3 years . We do n't  have a tub in either bathroom . Our spaces are too small for a claw foot . Our home is not at all appropriate for a family with children . Yard of hills ( no play area at all ) and a blind curve with too fast of traffic . Whoever will buy this house when we are done will surley be without children . Thanks for sharing the lovely pics . <p> Go for the pedestal tub over the claw foot . My grandmother told me one of the reasons people started taking them out of bathrooms is because they hated trying to clean under them ! I did n't  even think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , they take up less room , and even though I use mine all of the time a lot of people do n't  so one that gives the appearance of a bigger bathroom might help ! Have fun ! <p> My mom has a claw foot tub in her bathroom . Its beautiful : - ) . A pain to clean under , but beautiful . She had the builders install a granite shelf between the tub &amp; wall . That way , she still had somewhere to put things , but the shelf was n't visible if you just looked at the tub . <p> I have a large jacuzzi type tub plus a separate shower and find the tub extremely hard to get in and out of and plus you slide around quite a bit ( and I 'm tall ) . It also takes forever to fill . I 'm loving the first three tubs and even though claw foot tubs are great looking , I would hate to clean the floor underneath . I would definitely consider a regular tub unless you have the room for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wish I could justify a remodel with a soaker tub ! Have fun with yours !

For my first 10 days in Europe I had a traveling companion , my good girlfriend Karin accompanied me to Paris and London and we had such a blast .

With all the festivities planned over the next few months , I wanted to make some wine glass charms to help keep everyone 's glass identified during all the celebrating . <p> I first found out about an embossing powder called Amazing Glaze that hardens to a resin from my friend Cathe , she had used it to to make a memory pet tag and decal penny pendant in the past and I really wanted to try it out ! - I ordered the powder , some pendant bases and earwires , then came up with several versions of DIY wine glass charms .

Then I applied two more thin layers following the same technique , 2 minutes in a 350 degree oven until the powder melts and turns clear . <p> It hardens into a resin to make these little gems for your wineglass ! <p> Next , I experimented with some round numbered stickers from the scrapbook section of my local craft store to create these numbered versions .

I made a small hole in the top with a nail , then melted a few thin coats of the Amazing Glaze powder over them in the oven . <p> Hey , a tag for all my favorite drinkers ! <p> *hiccup* <p> No need to use this method for just wine glass tags , it works just as well for making charms for necklaces or bracelets too . <p> Yes it 's true , the blingy glitter versions are my most fave , and I think they 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases at Rubber Nation and the wine glass earwires at FeatherBoutique on Etsy. - Amazing Glaze is available on Amazon , $10 for 2 ounces but I have well over an ounce left over after making all these wine glass charms .

I love this . Did I understand you to say you first put aluminum foil on the pendant base , then put the glitter on , then the glaze on top of the glitter ? I just want to make sure I make these correctly . Thanks . <p> Ok , I 'm NOT a crafty person . I tried these today and basically did not evenly spread out the glaze powder ( plus hard to do on top of glitter : ) So after baking it was just a blob of resin . I guess I thought it would spread out over the pendant ? So what trick did you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter evenly ? Thanks ! ! <p> Hi ! Thanks for the response ! So if I reheat them again and add a little powder to the edges of the pendants do you think it will be ok ?

Its my fault ! : ) I 'm sure once I try again they will come out looking great . : ) Thanks ! Jen 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057737 @3257737/ <h> Quotes with Watercolor <p> By Kate Riley July 28 , 2014 <p> A few days ago was my first visit to a Hobby Lobby here in Las Vegas in search of furniture knobs . I 've never been to a HL store before , we only have Michaels in my county in California so it was fun to check it out . As I browsed I got the urge to get creative my daughter loves to paint so we found ourselves in the aisle with all the art supplies <p> Watercolor art is de rigueur and admittedly I 'm a fan of its use in textiles and prints . I had an idea to create frameable quotes in white lettering with a watercolor brushstroke background so we picked up some brushes , papers , and paints and I experimented with two separate methods . <p> At first I wondered if I could achieve the look I was going for with a bleach pen but I never ended up trying it out because I found two alternatives to get the look : liquid frisket and a basic white acrylic paint marker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea myself until I read the label , but its a peel away masking fluid that retains white areas and prevents paint from adhering to paper . Cool ! I thought of my one year old nephew and a favorite book , so I used the frisket to freehand a popular quote from a childrens book . <p> Once dry I applied a few layers of watercolor brush strokes over the top <p> Liquid frisket peels up off paper like that sticky stuff you find on the back of gift cards . Make sure to peel it up within an hour or two or it will tend to grab the paper behind it in places , but if you peel it up within 30 minutes of drying it comes off cleanly . <p> Maybe its me but the sensory feeling of peeling off goo to reveal lettering is fun ! <p> We made this one for my daughters friends , its a fun way to use casual painted script in combination with watercolor to form a childs name or a favorite short saying or verse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrylic marker applied to the top . I was disappointed with the rounded tip , I should have paid more attention , but you can buy Liquitex markers with a script tip for more calligraphic lettering . <p> The white marker achieves a similar look as the frisket but with an overlay of paint marker lettering instead of the use of masking fluid . It is easier to control since its a pen not a brush so you could use a fancy font you love and paint over it with the marker , in white or black or any color . <p> Its a art fun project and one that allows for much creativity with the use of color and quotations ! .. <p> Hey Kate , Do n't  you love Hobby Lobby ? Like you , we only have Michaels in my area so when I was recently on a trip to Baltimore I jumped at the chance to go to HL . I call it Michaels on steroids ! I 'm off to do some googling of Firsket to see what else I can use that stuff for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wow ! How fun and inspirational ! And easy enough to do . I think I might even ask my daughter to make such art for her Grandmas 70 birthday . Thank you so much ! Havent visited you at your blog lately but now I now why I loved visiting daily . : ) <p> They also have fabulous fabric and the cheapest professional framing . i used to think they just carried creepy dolls eyes and depressor stick for really " crafty " stuuff , but they have everything . Always be sure to download the single item 40 ? off coupon . You have a really different readership . littlegreen notebook was called out for going there . It would be nice if there were another alternative . p.s. very pretty project . Frisket seems easier to use than latex , so I may try it as a resist with my pottery glazing . <p> Interesting idea for quick " Happy Birthday " type signage , and cool art ! I 'm curious if frisket can only be used with watercolor . It does seem possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint posts came into my mail today , yours and Yukp at northfieldgate maybe an omen to get my unused set out of the bin and enjoy ! <p> Agree with Fiona 100% . Sounds like an awesome store , I would lovebut not going to sell my soul . Thinking about canceling this blog . Know politics shouldnt get into arts and crafts , but really HL is throwing us back into the dark ages . <p> I understand your political position Genevieve and Fiona , many people feel the same . I also understand HLs position under the First Amendment based on religious beliefs . I respect your disagreement and refusal to shop there , that 's your right too . <p> I 'm so excited to see you do a feature on Watercolor . I am a watercolorist and I have decorated my entire house with watercolor paintings . I did something similar to this for my niece when she was born , creating a silhouette of her face using the masking fluid . I noticed you can also sometimes find the masking fluid at Walmart ( Winsor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ( student level ) has much more vibrant colors than the craft set . My favorite colors for these kind of paintings are Ultramarine Blue and Opera Rose . Some watercolors are toxic , so look for the AP label on the back of the paint . <p> The recent ruling that allows the First Amendment to be applied to for-profit corporations will find itself on the wrong side of history . In the meantime , the women who work at Hobby Lobby will take their skills elsewhere and consumers ( like me ) will vote with their pocketbooks . And internet browsers . <p> I love this idea ! I wonder if a plain or white crayon ( like the kind that comes with Easter egg dye kits ) would do the same thing ? Better yet , I 'll try it and let you know ! <p> And for what its worth , I did n't  take your helpful craft post to be in any way an endorsement of Hobby Lobby ( which I boycott ) . It is , to me , simply the sharing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy their craftsy supplies at any one place over another . Ill still be happily reading every post , and thanks for having this blog ! <p> Kate , another really great tutorial , thank you . totally support Hobby Lobby AND their stand , and will continue to shop there every chance I get ! I appreciate your graceful response to those trying to bully you and agree this is not a political forum , it is you sharing a " find " with us. thank you for your blog . <p> Btw , I 'm a Christian that completely disagrees with HL and the SCOTUS decision <p> This seems like a perfect way to get young children involved . Use frisket to paint a saying on it , maybe even one the child chose . Then let them paint all over the paper , encouraging them to cover the entire paper , and let/help them peel the frisket off . Even a two-year-old can end up with a really nice piece . <p> I also enjoy the sensation of peeling : -P " Frisket " is on my list of future craft supplies , thanks ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057738 @3257738/ <h> DIY : Tongue &amp; Groove Walls <p> By Kate Riley July 1 , 2013 <p> Greetings all and welcome to July ! Can you believe half the year is gone already ? Sheesh ! We had a fun filled weekend , spending Friday night with a group of friends going to a club to have dinner and cocktails and listen to a band . Saturday we stopped by the Days of Wine and Lavender ' event at Matanzas Creek Winery , sampling gourmet bites and local wines , so fun ! <p> But there was some work we finished up too , the tongue and groove wall treatment we installed in friend 's dining room two weeks ago . It made sense to start this total room makeover with the walls first before adding the new table , chairs , light fixture , and window panels ( coming soon ) . <p> We installed classic tongue and groove vertical planks to the walls all supplies courtesy of Lowes . The room is still in a very neutral stage right now I 'm deciding what to do above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here is a look at the new wall treatment with the steps we followed and products we used to add tongue and groove planks to this dining space in progress . <p> We started with the Pickwick planks from Lowes , look for them in the lumber &amp; trim department . These tongue &amp; groove pine planks come in packages of six pieces and are ready to stain or paint . <p> It 's best to choose a corner to start and work your way out from there . The planks are designed with grooves on one side so that they fit like puzzle pieces together . <p> We used a combination of adhesive and nails so the planks would have staying power , applying a thin amount of adhesive and then securing the planks to the wall with a brad nailer . <p> Since the panels add thickness to the wall , use spacers to extend your electrical sockets like the ones we used here so the plates are flush with the new paneling . <p> To notch the panels around the window sills and electrical sockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The planks are thin enough so that they can be notched for the sections around the window sill and electrical sockets . <p> With pine , there will be knots and holes to fill so anticipate that I used wood filler and paintable caulk to fill all the gaps . <p> We added a chair rail to the top and ended it at the edge of the windows since the homeowners want to continue to use their inside mount blinds for privacy and light control . To maintain clearance the edge needed to stop there , but since new window panels will hide the edge , this simple solution made sense . <p> Once the planks were installed , I coated with Zinsser Bullseye 1-2-3 Primer and Valspar paint in semi gloss in the color Ivory Dust ' to match the existing baseboard paint color . A roller helps for quick application but you 'll need a brush for the grooves . <p> I had planned to have the planks sit taller on the wall , but figured out I could save money by making the planks multitask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the baseboard to the bottom of the window sills as the first cut , and using the remaining portion of the plank for the taller portion of the walls , we were able to use one single plank two times . Although we compromised with shorter planks , in hindsight , the shorter planks on the wall will allow for a fun design element above . <p> I 'm considering a bold wall color <p> or perhaps a textured or patterned wallpaper . <p> I ca n't make a decision until we pick fabric for the window panels and settle on a color palette which will happen next week , stay tuned ! <p> *all supplies for this project courtesy of Lowes , all opinions my own ! <h> 38 comments <p> It looks so good ! I have tongue and groove planks up in our garage entryway and have been wanting to change up the wall above it . I 'm tossing around the same ideasbold paint or fun wallpaperso excited to see what you pick . There is a fun wallpaper pattern at Lowes that I am heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scout &amp; Nimble <p> Looks great ! I used that same molding ( which I understand is sold as door casing ) as chair rail over my beadboard , too . I feel much vindicated to see that someone with excellent taste has done the same thing : ) . <p> I also have an unrelated question . The house we moved into in 2011 had a wee grape arbor . Though we do n't  eat a lot of grapes ( or drink wine ) , we find it charming , and hope to maintain it . But the grapes are capable of killing their own supports repeatedly . My latest efforts at pouring concrete footings for new posts are not going well , and now I 'm starting to think I may need to start over from scratch with even tougher supports than the originals . How do you support your grapes ? Also , would aggressive pruning solve this problem ? ( I had n't  pruned at all , until this year when I had to hack off a ten-foot length of vine that had wrapped itself around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . ) If so , what is the right time of year to prune , and how much should I take off ? <p> Hello Misfit , our grapes are trellised on sturdy wires with stakes in between and heavily pruned in early summer so the fruit is more intense . When and how much to prune depends on your region and your grape variety , I 'd talk to a local nursery to find out what 's best for yours . : ) <p> We are in the process of buying an older home which will need some updating in some areas . I LOVE the planked walls , but how do you get the tops of the planks to come out even and level . We have found that working in any home , the room is not always square and I 'm curious how you made the tops so even . Thanks . <p> Karen once we installed a few in the corner I used a level to figure out where the rest should fit and drew a line with a pencil where the tops should go so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope that helps ! <p> Hi Judy , baseboards are always an issue when installing planks . When we did board &amp; batten in our boys room we had to remove them and cut them to fit the battens . Thankfully these planks are thin enough ( 5/16 of an inch as I recall ) to not be a problem , you can fill any gaps with caulk . Kate <p> Right after I posted my question I found them at HD Supply . I bought 10 bags : ) . Now I can finish my project AND replace the loose tile pieces that my builder used to space my kitchen outlets 20 years ago ! ! ! <p> I just finished putting PVC planking in my bathroom and am very pleased with the results . @ Karen , who has an older homemake sure you have the vertical lines ( beading and vertical edges ) of the planks plumb ! Use a level or plumb line to make sure they are running perpendicular to the where the top railing will be placed . Do not start hanging the planks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not . You may have to cut some of the planks at the top or bottom to accommodate for the flaws of your walls . Try to keep the vertical cut pieces in the corners , where they are less noticeable . Also , you can buy moulding that actually caps off the top or bottom of the planks , rather than butting the joints as shown in the pictures above . Using this type of moulding allows you to nail the planking at the very top and bottom where the moulding will cover it , saving you from filling all those nail holes and painting over them ! <p> Wow ! ! What an amazing transformation already ! The paneling looks so beautiful ! I leaving toward a bold color choice for the top portion of the wall ! Patterened Wallpaper is always nice too , I just always lean more towards paint ! ! <p> Looks great and seems easy too ! I want to do a plank wall in our half bath . Was originally thinking pallets , but they are so dang hard to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planks expensive ? 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057742 @3257742/ <h> The Stud Trend <p> By Kate Riley September 16 , 2013 <p> Ever since my recent trip to NYC , I 've been crushing on studded trim . Maybe I 'm feeling a little edgy or just craving a bit of glam as the holidays approach . Studded trim is a cousin of our favorite nailhead it adds a raised textural and metallic touch to accessories which is why I 'm drawn to it . <p> Studded trim is everywhere in fashion and it 's one of my favorite trends right now on handbags , shoes , belts , and jewelry . I love that studs are appearing in home decor too , so after I discovered a stash of studded trim last week , and I could n't resist embracing the trend in a small way with my own version of a striped studded accent pillow . <p> The pillow is a combination of a simple zippered linen pillow cover and some trim I found last week . More details below , but first a peek a few ways studs are appearing on other pillows . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and gold , featured here on Design*Sponge . Notice the trim on the accent pillows on her bed , you could mimic the look with gold pyramid studs and plain white pillow covers . <p> I created my own combining linen fabric and champagne gold pyramid trim . <p> I was inspired by the studded pyramid trim ( and chain ) I spied at Joann last week the fashion and home decor possibilities are endless my friends ! <p> The studded plastic trim I bought was ultra mega shiny gold ( top left ) so I toned it down with some champagne spray paint . Yes , I sprayed painted my bling . <p> Some hot glue was really all I needed to secure it to the pillow cover , which renders it dry clean only , but better that than then trying to run painted pyramid trim through my sewing machine , no thanks . <p> The trim gives the linen pillow cover a unique look for just the cost of 2/3 yard of linen fabric ( $5 ) and 2 yards of trim ( $16 with coupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue but there are other methods for adding studs to decor . Kelly at Fabulous K created a gold studded acrylic tray inspired by a high end versions using hot glue like me . <p> I like the studded look . They add a bit of sparkle in a toned down manner I think . But for the most part they are just decorative , I cant imagine using a studded pillow to lay against lol I love Jess Livelys space , such great taste she has . <p> Of course . I actually had a childrens wear line for years and I used one then too . I have to admit that was only 10 years ago . Ha ! It was my 2nd one . I rocked a chambray shirt that I studded and embroidered ! Oh did I think it was the coolest ever ! ! ! You are as always , amazing and sensational . Thanks <p> The pillow is gorgeous ! When you get a chance , update us on the comfort factor . They now have a fabric hot glue , I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash it " glue might work well here too . The bedazzler reminds me of Betty White . In some show she was trying to prove her artistic ability and said , " This track suit did n't  bedazzle itself . " Sometimes Darren and I just say that to each other and then laugh like crazy . 23102 @qwx883102

I 'll spill all the details of the event I attended very soon ! <p> Today I wanted to share a recent revamp of a great little writer 's desk I recently scored at a thrift store . This desk was a total bargain , marked at $49 at my local St. Vincent de Paul , but it was 50% off furniture day , so I picked her up for $25 dollars . Solid wood , classic lines , rope detail around the desktop , and little pull out ledges on each side makes this the perfect writer 's desk . How could I resist bringing it home ? <p> The top was scratched and dented , so I thought with just a simple coat of white paint and a little distressing , this desk could be brought back to life , and would be so lovely . <p> Here is the desk Before : <p> . <p> And After : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing this desk into my entry . I was thinking of replacing the hardware , but lately I 'm loving antique gold finishes , so instead of new knobs , I simply recoated the original black and gold knobs with antique gold paint so the finish is more subtle , and less shiny . <p> . <p> To refinish this piece , I followed all of the same techniques I mentioned in this recent article on how to paint furniture . Some light sanding with my 3M sanding wedge . . . <p> . <p> . . . led to this distressed finish , bringing out a hint of the original wood tones . <p> . <p> Scratched up before . . . <p> . <p> . . . and after <p> . <p> Nothing like a coat of white paint to freshen a great find . <p> . <p> For now , the desk is sitting in my entry , but here 's a funny thing .

And I thought about painting it white , but then I was n't sure how it would turn out . For some reason , I 'm always hesitant about painting wood , but after seeing your desk I 'm ready . I really wanted a white desk in my study and I 'm ready to take the plunge . Great job ! <p> Oh you did a beautiful job on the desk ! ! Can I ask exactly what kind/brand of " antique gold paint " you used on the knobs ? I tried to " golden up " a picture frame but it does n't  look as nice and bright as your desk knobs do thank you ! ! <p> Love it ! Definitely a great find for so cheap ! I always wait to buy thrifted furniture until I need it for a specific space I really just need to start buying up good deals because I know it will find a place , just like this guy ! ! : ) <p> Hey Catie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both are sitting in my garage . Ill probably sell both the desk and the blue dresser and return the console table eventually . I like having pieces to move around the house when the mood strikes , especially if they 're pieces I foun for a bargain and fixed up myself . : ) <p> I love this distressed piece . It turned out great . I just bought a two drawer unit for my computer area and painted it whitebut now I 'm thinking it definitely needs to be distressed ! I love that look . Casual and nice . Love it . Blessings , Debbie <p> So envious of your foray into NYC ! I have to wait until December . : ( The desk is looking mighty fine . You could always take out an ad " Looking for a loving home " and see who will treat the desk the best before deciding on a new owner . ; ) Love the hardware ! <p> You always find the CUTEST pieces !

A word to the wise , do n't  leave a bottle of windex on top of your desk where the sun can shine and heat up the bottle . Serious damage to the finish .

You can submit a donation here ( or click on the button in the sidebar ! ) <p> I 've made a lot of the ornaments but never thought about vases or other clear glass accessories . Good idea ! May I make a suggestion ? Wash and dry the vases before using the paint , especially if they are new , to get any dust , finish products or whatever off of them first . I know its recommended with the glass ornaments and probably would n't hurt with the vases . <p> The vases look so pretty a great way to control the color accents in your room and match them to complement what you already have . I have also found that if the vase has a large enough top , you can slip a smaller vase or bottle ( old pickle bottles work well ) right inside the painted vase and fill THAT with water . No one needs to know ! : ) <p> i love how you can custom color to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this . i did this almost 10 years ago for our wedding .. we had a christmas tree with ornaments with gold and white swirled paint so pretty ! then everyone got to take one home : ) <p> Fabulous idea , your vases look very high end . Could they be sprayed with a sealant on the inside . If not I love what Nans idea was . Got ta keep this in mindmy daughter has just bought a home , after all the demo its all coming together and this is a great idea to do for her new home ! Thanks ! <p> This might be comment 2 , because I do n't  see the 1st oneI love this high end look to something which appears so simple ! My daughter finalized on her 1st home about 6 weeks ago . This will make a great gift for her from Moms heart when all the remodeling is complete and she can finally moves in ! <p> I love this idea . I 've made the ornaments with my kids ages ago , I just never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your photo and a link to your blog on my blog . I hope that 's OK . You have wonderful ideas thanks for sharing with all of us . <p> These colors are GORGEOUS ! ! ! I have not had the best look with the drip/pour luckso far . I know you said you cant put water in the vases . Would you be able to if you baked the glass ? I am learning about this technique . I definitely want to get better because I see how gorgeous something can be ! <p> I bought some $2 vases at Ikea and some Pebeo Vitrea paint to make this . After the vases dry they get baked in the oven . They can then be used for fresh flowers perfect for a hostess gift . Thanks for the great idea ! <p> Hi , I just tried this project with acrylic paint , used black , red and beige and for some reason the black color would n't flow , the beige had great fluidity , the red not so bad but the black one would come in globs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluidity without losing color or shine , it took almost an hour to cover the whole vase about 7 ? tall , i might try it again as the results are n't  to my liking but I wanted to thank you for this blog and great ideas . Just recently found out about your blog and I 'm loving it . J <p> First I have to say that I love you website I was reading the one with the vases you did with the paint inside . I was wondering what colors you used . They would work wonderful with the colors in my bedroom . <p> Wondering if anyone has tried the baking method to set the paint . I have read online that baking it at 350* for a half an hour and allowing it to cool inside the oven before opening the door set the paint and made them usable for water and fresh flowers . Going to try this today , just wondering . My 9 year old daughter and I each made one last night following your instructions . They turned out amazingly .

Our accommodations were the Wyndham Resort in Denarau Island , 20 minutes from the Nadi airport . We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit with a kitchen which was great because we cooked our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with the island greeting " Bula ! " and we could n't wait to get our suits on and hop into the pool . <p> Our days were split equally between adventure and relaxation . Our first day we spent- breakfast by the shore then- visited a local village and we were given a tour by one of the local Fijian residents . Their homes are modest with open windows and doors , their hearts are big , and their children so sweet . We loved spending time with the local people , it was a Sunday morning and the villages Methodist church choir was singing a cappella , so lovely . <p> Fiji is made up of over 300 islands , one day we took a boat trip to Beachcomber Island , a destination resort with beautiful blue waters to snorkel in . You can walk around the island in 20 minutes , on it is a small resort with a bar with sand on the floor , like something youd see in the movies . <p> Where we were was very family friendly and there is no shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining , boating , snorkeling , parasailing , the list is endless . Yep that 's me zip lining across the rainforest , so fun ! <p> I went to Fiji for a week back in 2006 ( after spending a month in Australia ) . I was young back then , and traveling with a group , so we did n't  stay anywhere especially lavish , but it really did n't  matter . We caught a boat from the main island to the island our resort was on and spent the days doing water sports , hiking , relaxing and generally just enjoying island life . The nights were filled with fire shows , Kava drinking , and plenty of other drinking . It was like a party every night . We also toured some of the local towns on other islands , including one with no electricity or running water . It was a wonderful way for the group I was traveling with to gain a little perspective . Our group mostly consisted of young , affluent Americans who probably had n't  been exposed to much outside of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in my mind the most are the people I met that lived and worked there . The people at the resort , and others we met in town , were just SO FRIENDLY . I still have several pictures with the folks we met , and really cant say enough about their hospitality . I 've traveled to many other islands/countries since Fiji , and while they are all wonderful , there was something special about the Fijian people . " Bula " is not just a word they use there , its a way of life . <p> The other thing I remember quite vividly is how amazing their fresh fruit was . I remember the morning we arrived , there was a breakfast spread laid out for us , and while I remember everything I ate being very good during the whole trip , I specifically remember that being the best fruit I had ever had up to that point in my life . I made sure to load up with every meal . <p> Fiji was a place I may not have picked to go on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity presented itself , I figured I may never get the chance again . I 'm so glad I was able to see Fiji and meet its people . I have nothing but good memories ! <p> My son was in Figi the first part of this month . He s working for a sailboat delivery company , taking a boat from Adelaide to Seattle . He said he really wished theyd had more time there , and wants to go back . He was in the Navy for six years , and never got a tattoo during that time . Figi broke that record ! <p> I loved Fiji but I 've never been on a vacation I did n't  like ! We stayed on Plantation Island in 2009 in a perfect bure right on the water . My 3 men are big water sports lovers , so we did a lot of snorkeling , they water skied , scuba dived , surfed , fished , body boarded . I took a cooking class and enjoyed learning about their local crafts . We were fortunate enough to enjoy the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . Every single person there could n't believe a sunset could be that beautiful ! An Australian couple we met there sent us the photo they took and I enjoy looking at it daily in my office/studio . We bought a large tapa print that enjoys center stage in our family room plus the tapa pillow in the living room . . . yeah , I loved Fiji . <p> Figi looks beautiful . In another month I 'll be dying to be on a beautiful , WARM beach like those . You look " Mahhh-velous " yourself , like a celebrity on vacation . I hope you and your beautiful family have a very happy Christmas Kate . <p> I went to Fiji for 17 days in 2000 , taking my 9 year-old daughter along . I agree that the people are incredibly kind and that the fruit is out-Of-this-world delicious . But kava ? ? Like drinking dirt ! ! The appeal was totally lost on me . Fiji has scenery and colors so vivid they can not adequately be described . I came home from that trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago ! ) and was so disappointed at the resulting photos ! They just werent nearly as vivid as I had experienced . Moral of the Story : Fiji must be seen and experienced in person . Worth it 100% . <p> Looks like a lovely place ! Ca n't wait to see other pics from the rest of your trip . <p> looking at some of the prices on the boards you took picture of , hows the money conversion there ? ? I 'm curious to know if your dollar goes far or not . Like you hear about Thailand , it may cost a lot to get there but you can live on $10 a day . <p> I spent a semester abroad in Australia in college and on the way back the states , I stayed at Beachcomber for a week ! So crazy to see pictures from there and hear from another person that 's been there . It was so surreal , a tiny piece of heaven in the middle of the beautiful ocean . I will never forget taking a tiny boat from the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically having it all tossed out onto the sand and wading from the boat onto the shorein the middle of the night : ) So glad you were able to experience it <p> We have just returned home ( to Australia ) after 12 days in Fiji . There was so much to do and see as well as trying to find some down time to relax and soak up the atmosphere . We spend 6 days at the Hilton on Denarau Island , then headed to the Outrigger on the Coral Coast for my sisters wedding ( where we were able to spend a couple of days with all of my siblings and the kids had great cousin time we live in another state so they only see each other 2 or 3 times a year ) . After being on the go for 8 days , I was craving some relaxation and we spent our final four days at a little beach front resort called Tambua Sands . It was only about a 3.5 star resort , but very clean , great food and wonderful staff . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After shopping , a village visit , island cruise , scuba diving for a couple of our family members who are certified , jet skiing , day trips to explore , a wedding , meals out with family and friends , kayaking and snorkelling I loved being able to lay back and just " be " for a couple of days . We are already planning our next trip as there is so much more that we want to experience . The beautiful people definitely made our trip extra special . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057766 @3257766/ <h> Ogee Edge Wood Countertops <p> By Kate Riley November 5 , 2012 <p> We 've finally turned our attention back to the hallway bathroom remodel that we started last spring with the vanity upgrade . Weve lived without a sink and just a plywood top in here for 9 months while I went on the hunt for the right countertop and as a result the bathroom remodel came to a halt . <p> The main reason for the delay came down to choosing the right countertops and I needed two , one for the sink vanity ( seen with plywood above ) and another for the cabinet on the opposite wall . I had my heart set on solid surface marble or Caesarstone for a long time but all the estimates were extremely pricey ( $1,400 and up ! ) <p> It came down to the decision to save up a lot of cash for marble or Caesarstone or just get er done with wood countertops topped with a vessel sink for this hall guest bathroom . We chose wood , but I wanted a more polished edge beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countertops . <p> I did some research and learned that I could get a fancy ogee edge with a great power tool a plunge router coupled with a specialty bit , so I ordered this router and this ogee bit online from True Value . <p> It arrived a week later ( free shipping ! ) and I picked it up at my local True Value hardware store for this project . <p> The bit has a self guiding part ( a mini wheel attachment ) that slides along the edge of the wood while the sharp edge of the bit cuts the detail on the wood . As long as you follow the instructions provided for the tool , its easy to give your wood countertop a carved edge with this power tool + bit combo . <p> This particular model plunge router does not come with a sawdust collector so the wood particles fly everywhere its best to make these cuts outside and wearing safety goggles ! <p> Make sure you cut on a steady surface we used an old table we set up outside for stability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . <p> It takes just a few minutes to give a wood countertop a really nice detailed edge with this router tool and an ogee bit . <p> We borrowed a friends table saw to rip the edges of both countertops so the width and depth fit the measurements of our bathroom . The next step is sanding and staining , then adding several layers of protective varnish to make it waterproof . <p> I 'm torn about the finish stain weathered gray or classic dark ? <p> The cabinets will be painted white and the glass tile will be spa blue , so either finish will work . Ill experiment with the various stains and report the program as well as my writing about my experience . I have also been compensated for the materials needed for my DIY project . My opinions are entirely my own and I have not been paid to publish positive comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mdf . it routers great as well .. but a hint .. keep a very consistent speed and pressure . and practice on some scraps if its the 1st time using a router ! it can be a bit tricky . <p> I love the gray one ! I am not a fan of the wood look unless you are going for a rustic or english cottage type thing great work ! I 'm itching to buy a fixer-upper for me and my husband to be , but well see ! <p> I vote for the dark wood stain . Looks great so far this excactly what I want to do for a kitchen island countertop when the time comes for that update ! Have you considered using waterlox for sealing it Ive read great things about it but do n't  have any personal experience with it . <p> That 's funny I did a very similar project this week , I built a counter top by laminating 2 ? boards into an 8 ft counter , because it cost less than $70 to do that . I routered the edge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three coats of oil stain Varathanes Kona . I an just attaching the under mount sink right now , this is for my laundry room . I may do this for my master bath also . Hopefully it will be installed and functional tomorrow . Your counter looks great . Chris <p> We just did a walnut floating shelf with a vessel sink in our guest bathroom and I 'd recommend Waterlox for sealing your wood . I do n't  know if you can get it in California , but it is well worth it to track down . Perfect for protecting wood in a bathroom/wet environment . Good luck ! <p> I Love the classic dark stain in the second picture ! Can you tell me what color of stain that is ? I 'm getting ready to stain my kitchen countertops and that is exactly the shade I 'm going for ! Thank you ! ! <p> Love this idea ! I love the white , wood look . Youve used it before on other projects and its so classic . Since reading your posts Ive painted two prices white with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the can of Polyshades . DO NOT use it on the counter top unless you seal it really well . Really well . We used it to refinish our cabinets and it has not held up at all . Were talking cabinet doors and frames which are not subject to the water that a counter top would be . Seriously give more than a thought before you use the polyshades . <p> I have absolutely no idea about the wood finish : I think the " weathered gray " might look nicer in the space and do well with the kiddos , but the classic finish might blend better with your house . Either way , I 'm sure the room will come out wonderfully . <p> I vote classic dark . But I 'm partial since we put in wood countertops with white cabinets in our kitchen this year . We almost did the glass tile too , but opted for marble tiles instead . We stained them in Minwax Dark Walnut and sealed them with Satin Waterlox . You 'll love the wood either color ! <p> The edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I vote ( oh , that reminds me its election day . got to grab my coat , scarf , gloves , etc. and head out to vote soon ) , I vote for the classic dark ( which will beautifully pop against the light colors of white + blue ) . I believe you life softer tones/hues ( like the gray ) , but dark color is well classic beauty . And hey , 4 years from now ( next presidential election ) u can revamp its color ( the beauty of wood ) . : ) <p> Super project , and great DIY ! I have been dreaming up a new kitchen in which the perimiter counters are butcher block and the island is stone . I was thinking about where I would get the edge beveled to match the stone and now I know I can easily do it myself . Ill have to find a tool like that here . Thanks ! <p> I do n't  think you can go wrong with either color and I am loving the wood ! Varathanes water based floor polyurethane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth durable finish it gave my stair treads <p> Hey Katebe warned that the router can woo you in to many more cool projects ! I have a dedicated router table and the same free-style router you just got AND ABOUT 30 different router bits profiles now ! Its wAAAy fUn ! Catherine <p> Hey , great minds think alike . We just did our kitchen counters in IKEA butcher block and added a very similar decorative edge . I did a little tutorial on how to cut the edge as well . <p> I like how your bit ended up making it look , very classic . I think this is a great use for butcher block counters , especially once you make it waterproof . <p> One thing we really needed to watch out for when adding the edge to our oak counter is the tendency " fuzz " up the cut or even burn the edges . The best way to overcome that is to make multiple cuts , taking a little away each time . <p> The other advantage to a decorative edge is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butcher block in a near seamless manner using the same router bit in a negative fashion . This is what we had to do in the corner of our counters in front of our sink . Its a cool trick all made possible by the router . <p> I love the look of that weathered gray stain ! I hate my dining room table because of its color ( cherry ) but its a good size for our apartment , and I do n't  want to buy something new until I can buy it for the long haul . I wonder how that stain would work on top of cherry wood ? I do n't  want to strip it . Hmm . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057771 @3257771/ <h> Powder Room Makeover <p> By Kate Riley April 11 , 2016 <p> Hello everyone ! Today I 'm sharing a beautiful powder room makeover completed at a friends house , the same friend Kara who gave her staircase a happy makeover last year . I 've partnered with IKEA this year to serve as a Brand Ambassad+r , so when Kara mentioned that she was looking for a bathroom makeover , I decided this- was the perfect opportunity to show off some IKEA products . <p> Kara 's powder room was feeling very blah and dated . The tan walls , basic pedestal sink , and a builder-grade oval mirror left her feeling uninspired . This powder room also has access to a big storage space under the stairs , so Kara was looking for a way to jazz up the plain closet door as well . The changes are quite dramatic ! The new space feels fresh and modern , and it was all completed with the help of IKEA products . <p> Here 's the before ' and after ' . <p> - - <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and suggested my favorite- gold paint for the mirror and pulls ( see this post ) but Kara did all the real work in this space , including assembling and installing the vanity and faucet herself . Yes , she can now add plumbing to her DIY skills ! Kara sent me pictures throughout the makeover and I was excited to see the daily progress . <p> The makeover began with the idea to combine dark walls with pale wood vanity and brass details . Yes , you can use dark color in small spaces . It gives the space a moody vibe and the deeper hue allows the lighter features ( the vanity and the art ) to pop out at you when you enter . <p> Knowing that she wanted to paint the walls a deep navy , the GODMORGON/ODENSVIK floating vanity in white oak was the perfect choice to complement the light wood floors and pop against the dark walls . Kara also added hairpin legs ( not for support , just for the look ! ) that she spray painted gold for a chic little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she spray painted to mimic the brass . <p> - <p> The LUNDSK+R faucet brings a different finish other than gold/brass to the mix . It 's a powder coated black that adds drama . You can save up to 50% more water with this faucet since it has a mechanism that reduces water flow , while maintaining pressure during use . <p> - <p> IKEA prides itself on manufacturing and selling faucets that help people save energy and water , and reduce waste , all while saving money , too . All of the bathroom faucets sold at IKEA have a function that mixes air into the water stream so you use less water without losing water pressure , so very smart ! <p> The art on the walls is another budget friendly project , I downloaded the two tropical leaf- prints from The Graphics Fairy ( source below ) then printed them and framed them . They add just a bit of botanical that 's always appealing on walls , and the white frames add beautiful contrast against the navy walls . <p> - <p> Kara attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The toilet paper holder got a coat of gold leaf paint and the old sconce was replaced by an antique brass industrial style light ( source below ) . <p> - <p> - <p> Kara was smart to follow the line created by the staircase pop out all the way down . Notice how Kara aligned the light fixture , the vintage mirror , and the narrow vanity all along that plane . <p> - <p> Beautiful job Kara ! So much thanks to IKEA for supplying much of what you see in this makeover ! <p> I like the design and admire how cost-effective it was ! I find the design of the faucet to be stylish and its really convenient how it conserves water . I try to find faucets with those attributes to pitch to my clients . Ill have to look into it more . Thanks for posting this ! Your friends bathroom looks great ! <p> Do you know what she used to paint the Lansa handles and if she did anything special to them . I painted some not long ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most use . I sanded and primed before spray painting . : ( Thanks for any advice ! <p> Very clever and sophisticated work by your friend , Kara , and the serendipity for me is that I was mulling over my mid-1980s bathrooms yesterday ( the vanity/sink off the bedroom master and an angled wall in the guest bath with a custom countertop/cabinet slanted to fit against a totally stupid slanted wall ) . I 'm remembering that you are the queen of bathroom and powder room redos so you 're the one I 'll be consulting when the time comes . Pulling all your previous posts now . 23102 @qwx883102

Coats and Purses. - The first thing guests do when they arrive is look for a place to store their coat and bag , so you must have a place for their coats and purses. - Set aside a bedroom or a closet away from the party , or invest in a folding coat rack . <p> 3 . Have an icebreaker. - - Many people love to help at parties so give them a small job if they ask , or play a simple party game. - Weve played a guess me game during the party before we wrote out names of movie characters on labels and placed it on everyones back when they came in. - They had to ask other party guests for clues until they figured out who they were , and it got everyone talking and laughing right away . <p> 4. - Create ambiance with lighting and music. - Great lighting is key- to setting the perfect mood at a party , so I 'm a big believer in having all your main living area switches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few candles , and turn on the outdoor lights too. - String some twinkle lights too , they add the perfect amount of light to your outdoor areas surrounding your home . <p> Also , have a playlist of holiday tunes ready to go that lasts several hours. - Pandora radio is great , also your TV cable station often has holiday playlists. - You can make your own CDs or use your iPod , just have lots of merry tunes ! <p> . <p> 5. - Distance your food. - For a larger party , serve finger foods or one bite appetizers , nothing guests need to slice. - Keep beverages in one place , food in another , and if you have room , desserts in a third location. - It forces guests to circulate ! - - I like to keep bowls of pistachios , salty mixes , or chocolate candies scattered around the house in pretty bowls too . <p> 6. - Keep some food warm. - On a winter evening , I believe its a good idea to serve some of your food warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party. - - - - Nothings worse than the hostess being tethered to her oven while her guests are in her home ( makeup melting from a hot oven , no thanks ! ) . - The way to pull it off ? - Rent , borrow , or buy a chaffing dish ( or two ) , or a warming platter . <p> I learned the hard way to not serve those popovers , hors doeuvres or phyllo dough appetizers that require you to stand next to the oven for 8 minutes to judge their perfect brownness. - No no no ! - I cook my no fail crowd pleasin Stroganoff meatballs and penne alfredo before the party , then set them out in chaffing dishes with a nice warmed ham with rolls , and its always enough for a crowd . <p> Then I never need to set foot in the kitchen except to grab more ice ! - Oh , and always make more food than you think you need. - Better to have leftovers than hungry guests ! <p> One way to keep costs ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I always ask a few gals to contribute some appetizers or desserts. - People love to bring chocolate candies , cookies , and other signature holiday recipes or small bites to share . <p> 7. - Keep drinks simple. - We serve some wine ( including ours ) , some beer , but mostly local champagnes. - People are always drawn to the bubbles on festive occasions we find. - Rarely do guest ask for mixed drinks , so we stopped serving them. - Always keep non alcoholic sparkling juices available too , plus juice boxes and water for the kids. - - - . <p> 8. - Real or plastic ? - Plenty of entertainers say " never serve your guests on plastic plates " . - Ahem. - I do n't  have an extra 80 plates lying around so guess what ? - You come to my par-tay , you may dine on melamine or plastic plates. - Sorry , but none of my friends seem to notice or care about that. - But if if bothers you , simply rent or borrow real plates . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or melamine dishes in my opinion , I say never serve wine or champagne in anything but stemmed glassware. - Wine and champagne glasses are cheap ( hello Goodwill ) or can easily be rented , so at least keep the glassware elegant. - Borrow them if you have to , I always do ! <p> People keep their glasses for hours ( use tags or charms to help identify them ) but not their plates , so decent stemware is most important. - - - - - . <p> 9. - Keep kids occupied. - I set aside a table for kids to do art , and always have a kid friendly Christmas movie playing in another room. - One trick we 've learned to keep kids calm is to have kids ( not parents ) remove shoes when they come over. - Something about them being in their socks keeps them relaxed ( and mud off your carpet , learned that the hard way too ! ) <p> Since we had kids , its hard to keep them occupied while we prepare for a crowd , so we invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the little ones entertained and happy. - If you have a super helpful grandma , aunt , or attentive friends , that works too. - Anyone that can assist with the kids , especially before the party starts , certainly helps ! <p> 11 .

Nothing is more special than opening your home to friends and family ( especially during the holidays ! ) thanks for the great reminder ! -shaunna : ) <p> Thanks for the list Kate !

So getting together with friends ( no kidsmine will sleep at Nana Magics ! ) for cocktails is necessary , given that many Chicagoans do n't  leave their homes once the temp hit freezing . <p> Such wonderful advice .

Or at least I hope you 'll post pictures of your decorations ! <p> Beautifully written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to let the nerves take over and think you have to go all out . Thanks for the reminder that friends are just happy to be welcomed . <p> If you can believe it , I actually do have 80 plates laying around . For my wedding , which was held at a farm , we bought china from goodwill and other thrift stores for about 8 months before the wedding the rule , no more than $1.00 a plate . I have kept all of my favorites . If you 're a thrifter , buy cheap plates when you see them . They are everywhere , you 'll a mass a great collectiong and it is so classy to pull out a pile and place them on the table . And , even better , I do n't  care if they break . <p> I have found that crockpots can work well for storing warm appetizers too ! Especially if there is a Keep Warm setting . Of course they are n't  really fancy looking but who cares ! I have a big one for meatballs and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . <p> You give great adviceI host a " Girlfriends Get-together " every Christmas for my girls that has become a much awaited formal affair . If I do n't  send out the invites by the first weekend in December I started getting phone calls about it . One thing I do is always make sure that I 'm not dressed when my first guest arrive . I leave them with the drinks and appetizers and I finish getting ready . It allows my " girls " time to hang-out and me the opportunity to run around getting everything ready until the last minute and not feel bad about it . : ) <p> Great post , thank you so much for all these wonderful tips . I have yet to have a party in our new house as we are constantly in the midst of renovations . I cant wait to host one , though ! Hopefully next year we will be done renovating ! <p> Thank you for the wonderful pointers . I am really going to try and figure out the lighting during my upcoming holiday party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have kids coming this time- and I do n't  have some of my own- so my mind is racking over what to do with them . <p> My own pointer to share with you- I collect wine glasses as well , but I also collect white plates . No need to match them , you can buy tons from the thrift store . I have almost 30 plates ( been collecting them since August ) , and have not paid more than 50 cents for any of them . Goodwill is great for them . I also get white cups/white mugs/regular glasses/white bowls/white serving dishes etc for other types of hosting . As long as they are in white- you do not have to worry about them being all different . Here are some pictures of my last party : LONG ... <p> Fabulous post , Kate ! ! !

One of these days I 'll manage to get all the gifts bought and wrapped early and host something for our friends . <p> One thing I did , that I believe I saw on Oprah was putting famous Christmas movies on the TV with the volume down . It gives people something to talk about , and makes for an even more Christmas atmosphere . Mircale on 34th street and Christmas Story are my personal favs . <p> Wonderful tips , Kate ! I love the idea of the " who am i " game ! Great ice breaker ! I also serve stroganoff meatballs for parties ! Takes forever to roll up the little meatballs ha ! Love the idea of the alfredo , do you have the recipe posted someplace ? <p> I put in a shout out to you in my post today . I could n't find the exact so I linked back to your home page . Hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Kate , you always inspire me with your sense of relaxed elegance . I love the rule that plastic plates are OK but always go with glassware for wine and champagne . . . You have totally inspired me to open up my home more often and not fear that things are n't  perfect or fancy enough . <p> Kristy I 'll have to post those recipes soon ! Tina , I make the sauce from sratch then simmer store bought meatballs ( I found some that actually taste homemade ) in the sauce for two hours . No need to roll them all myself and broil them seperately ! <p> That scene absolutely makes me tear up as well ! ! Ca n't wait to pull out the Christmas movies ! Thanks for this excellent overview . I 'm definitely going to apply a few of these things for my Christmas get togethers this year . <p> Kate , I love love love this post . I have a rule that anything utensil or glass that touches the guests mouth must be the real thing ( extra flatware and glassware bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plastic dishes perfect for entertaining a big crowd ! Also , tons and tons of little festive cocktail napkins are a must ! <p> PS I made your minestrone soup and it was delish ! Thanks for the recipe . <p> I swearmost entertaining guides are written by people who have NEVER thrown a party ! Thank you for this WONDERFUL down-to-earth guide to entertaining in the real world . I 've learned a few of these lessons on my own ( the hard way , haha ! ) and am happy to soak up your wisdom . I hope to see more posts like this . <p> I have a friend who hosts a Cookie exchange every year . We each bake 6 dozen of one kind and come home with 10-12 different types of cookies ! Then , we stick them in the freezer and bust out a dozen or two at a time for parties , Christmas dinners and when guests just drop by . It is perfect ! <p> Ok we threw major Christmas parties at our home also . We had valet parking which the guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain the children . And carolers would stop by at during the party . Lots of candles and re poinsettias .. We have n't had one in sometime and one of my older sons was talking the other day and he mentioned the awesome christmas parties we once hadKind of made me sad . have fun your tradition is wonderful and making great memories to cherish a lifetime . <p> What a great post . We do many similar things . We usually host Christmas day as we live in Germany and many of our friends cant go home ( the US ) for the holidays . We do a meal , but I mostly stay out of the kitchen . I like to enjoy myself and my guests do n't  mind eating off Christmas patterned paper or plastic plates . Can I come to your party ? It sounds like fun ! : ) <p> Great tips , most of which are applicable to parties during any season . Thanks for the rec against serving phyllo-dough anything . I 've made that mistake so many times , and you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen island where everyone congregates ( whenever I have a party , people ALWAYS end up in the kitchen ) . <p> Great post , Kate ! You make so many good points . And 80 guests ? Im impressed ! The last party we attended had plastic plates , cutlery , and glasses that were compostable , which I thought was a great idea for a large crowd . <p> Hey Kate ! I 'm your newest follower ! I have been visiting for some time thoughIm a blog Newbie , still figuring this all out ! I KNOW i 'm like your Billionth follower , but I would LOVE and appreciate if you would stop by my spot and check out my 14 days of christmas trees and a GIVEAWAY ! <p> What , you do n't  have 100 extra plates earmarked for party use only ? Seriously , someone gave me a great suggestion , buy the very inexpensive glass place settings that are always on sale around the holidays . You can store them in their original boxes . <p> i do n't  love that the options listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are so many more eco-friendly varieties out now for one-time use plates / utensils that will biodegrade or which are compostable vs. sit in a landfill for the rest of my life . they 're a bit pricier , but if i had to go that route , its a price i 'm willing to pay . i wish people knew those werent their only two options ! <p> I love these tipsespecially about the OK to plastic ( especially with the kids around ! ) and the notebook . My youngest childs birthday is December 20 , so we are " forced " to entertain before Christmas and I have found that its not as bad as I thought it would be . Great post ! <p> Great post ! Absolutely love the idea of the Christmas bulbs in the glass . What a great , simple way to add a splash of holiday color ! Thanks so much for all the tips . We travel for the holidays . : ( But someday we will stay home and your tips will come in handy ! <p> Fun post ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Santa prior to the bird ! Oh well , its really the only way , I agree , especially since well be in PETALUMA this year for Christmas ! Fun ! <p> Amazing post , Kate ! ! ! We hosted parties all the time when we lived in Nashville , but not so much now that were in Texas . I think life is so much more hectic here that we do n't  have a many friends , and they are spread all over . This has really inspired me to have a party , and invite all our friends from the many areas of our lives over at one time.maybe next year ! ; ) <p> Loved all your ideas about entertaining during Christmas . Would you share your stroganoff meatballs and alfredo penne recipes ? Sounds like a great menu . I 'd like to serve it on Christmas ! ! ! Thanks so much . 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057776 @3257776/ <h> Learning to Sew <p> By Kate Riley November 10 , 2010 <p> I grew up watching my mom and my aunts sew clothing , pillows , and curtains for their homes . There were no blogs to showcase their work , just their fellow community where they shared their tips and advice . It was the late seventies , times were tough , money was tight , and the economy was in the you know what . Ladies all across the nation were trading patterns and ideas , and sewing up a frenzy of home decor on a budget . Sounds kinda familiar does n't  it ? <p> The very best way to soften a space , to add texture , pattern and personality , is with the use of great fabrics , so I believe one of the best tools for an avid DIYer is a basic sewing machine . You 'll find plenty of tutorials online for no sew decor , and they are fantastic , in fact Ive done several myself . There are lots of times when fusible web , fabric glue , or safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a window treatment . Yay for those solutions ! Yet one thing Ive learned is that having the ability to work a sewing machine opens up an entirely new world . <p> Do you ever see a swatch of fabric , be it in the form of a dress , an apron , a napkin , a silk scarf , and you think to yourself , " This would make a great pillow ! " or you find a great fabric and think " I want to make curtains out of this . " It happens to me all the time ! You can design an entire space around a single swatch of fabric that inspires , be it a damask , geometric , Ikat or simple stripe pattern , whatever speaks to you . I am constantly inspired by patterns I find beyond the racks in fabric stores , and I 'm a big believer in reinventing them into new things . <p> For example , take these inexpensive napkins I found in a local kitchen store . Beautiful robins egg blue background with an apple green botanical pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , I turned them into a pillow ! <p> We all know custom window panels and designer pillows can cost a small fortune . Years ago , after gathering a few quotes , there came a moment when I just wanted the ability make a simple pillows for myself out of some favorite fabrics , but did n't  want to pay someone to have them made . So I did some research online , and I bought a basic Singer sewing machine for around $125 bucks . <p> My Mom did n't  teach me to sew ( I was n't interested when I was young ) . I taught myself by reading the manual and following directions . I learned how to thread the machine and to sew a straight stitch . Most recently , Ive mastered piping and zippers , all with some online tutorials , a lot of patience , and a little gumption . <p> So many people I converse with via email want the ability to create things for their home , but have never learned how to sew , mostly because they 're afraid its too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can do it ! <p> If you 're ready to get started , here are some encouraging words and a few pointers from my guest , Julie Anne Eason of Serious Sewing.com . <p> Ten Rules of the Road for Happy Sewing Machines <p> " A new sewing machine can be your gateway to a whole new world of creativity and thrifty fun . Its easy to imagine yourself spending long hours blissfully churning out cheap-but-chic fashions for yourself , your family and friends . But sometimes reality steps in and smacks unwary beginners upside the head . A sewing machine can provide hours of joy if you take the time to learn a few simple rules before you start to sew . <p> 1 . Use good thread . The number one reason people have trouble with a new sewing machine has something to do with thread . Cheap thread will shred and jam up your machine so if you 're having trouble ( especially with the dreaded " birdsnest " of tangled thread under your fabric ) just do yourself a favor and switch to a better brand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your project and change them often . I know people who think the only time you should change a needle is if it breaks . Not true . Needles get dull ; they get bent ; they get nicked ; they just plain wear out . After every ten hours of sewing , you should think about changing your needle . <p> You also need to use the right needle for the project . There are two types : ball point and sharps . Ball point needles are designed to sew knits ( anything stretchy ) and sharps are designed for woven fabrics ( non-stretchy . ) There are universal needles which usually work okay for both types of cloth . If you 're having trouble with skipped stitches or weird seams , ditch the universal for the appropriate type needle . Also , use the correct size needle for your fabrics as well . Sewing machine needles are sized differently for lightweight , medium and heavyweight fabrics . Check your machines instruction manual for specific recommendations . <p> 3 . Read your manual . Every machine is a little different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer for years , your new machine will work a little differently . It can take a little time to read through the entire manual , but its worth the effort . The authors often include priceless tips that you would n't find anywhere else . <p> 4 . When in doubt , rethread . It never fails , at the first sign of trouble with a stitch or seam , we all head straight for the tension dials . Please , for the love of fabric , leave the tension dials alone ! At least at first . Anytime you run into trouble , your first thought should be " hmm , maybe its threaded wrong . " Do yourself a favor and just rethread the machine . About 80% of the time , this will fix whatever is wrong . The other 20% could be you need a new needle or different thread . <p> here 's a bonus tip : Always , rethread your machine with the presser foot in the UP position . Otherwise , the thread might get caught by the tension disks and then your machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine often . Most sewers do n't  clean their machines nearly often enough because they think they have to take it to a sewing machine mechanic and pay $100 or more to get it cleaned . Go to YouTube or research online for a tutorial . If you can work a screwdriver , you can clean your machine . <p> 6 . Take the time to understand your stitches . Modern sewing machines come with a huge assortment of stitches ( some machines come with thousands built-in . ) Some of them are designed for sewing regular fabrics ; some are for stretch fabrics ; and some are purely decorative embroidery-type stitches . Using the wrong stitch for the wrong purpose will cause you trouble . <p> 7 . Use the correct presser foot for the job . Depending on your machine , you probably have a regular foot , a zig-zag foot , a button-holer , a walking foot , a zipper foot and a wide variety of others . These are specially designed to perform unique tasks , so use them appropriately . Presser feet are very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of a button . <p> 8 . Try this fancy trick . To help prevent that snarl you sometimes get at the very beginning of a seam when your fabric edge is too close to the needle , hold the main thread and bobbin thread in your left hand and pull gently for the first few stitches until the jagged parallel lines , or feed dogs are completely in control of the fabric . <p> 9 . Keep a pretty jar handy for bent pins and broken needles . I 've had one too many times where the needle slammed right into the pin and broke . Its always a hassle , so now I just pull the pins out as I sew . <p> 10 . Slow down . Were all in a hurry to get a project done , but sometimes you really need to slow down . When you 're first learning how to sew , when working tricky curves and sharp corners , or when you 're working with thick layers of fabric , you should start on the slowest setting and then speed up as you gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric . <p> If you 're inspired to purchase a new machine , I recommend new sewers choose quality over the lowest price . I think the Brother CS6000I is the best model for beginners , you can read my full review here . Having a machine that runs well means you can save money later by recycling used clothing , mending torn garments and creating pieces that fit you perfectly !

We are currently making aprons for my little girls birthday parties . I am hooked and only wish I had taken it up earlier ! Thanks for posting these tips ! Lx <p> The best Christmas present I ever received was a new , amazing sewing machine from my mom . That was last year . I mainly love to create quilts , but also love to sew pillows , curtains , craft projects , embroidered monograms etc etc . I LOVE fabric ( an obsession , really ) . Sewing is such a great skill to learn , and I find it so relaxing and stress relieving . That is beautiful fabric for the pillows you made , Kate ! I have a piece of very similar fabric in the same colour scheme awaiting to be sewn up for my youngest daughters room = ) <p> Thank you ! This is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that I am always wanting to make new pillows and draperies , but like everyone else I was too nervous . I think you have me convinced . I may have to put a sewing machine on my Christmas list ! Saving this post to my computer ! ! Abby <p> Oh what a great post ! I 'd loooooove to learn to sew sometime in the future . Both of my great grandmothers &amp; several great aunts all used to be seamtresses for very wealthy families back in the 50s &amp; 60s , I know I have some of that talent in my blood , I just need to tap into it : - ) <p> This is such a helpful post ! I grew up in a family where NONE of the women sewI have been determined since childhood to learn how to sew . I bought my first machine about a year ago , and have been learning as I go . Thanks so much for posting I had no idea I needed to clean my machine ! ( oops ! ) <p> My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . LOTS of " wrap-around skirts " in bright patterns ( the kelly green one with pink alligators comes to mind ) and wool skirts in plaid . Oh , the number of times I tried on something in a store and heard my mom say , " I can make that for a fourth of the price . And it looks cheap they did n't  even match the plaid ! " ( As if a 12-year-old cares ! ) She also made me tons of those fabric button-on purse covers that were the rage ( at least here in the mid-Atlantic ) at the time . ( kelly green with a pink alligator dead center and pink buttons , anyone ? ) Am I the only one ? <p> You have inspired me . I LOVE fabric but am powerless to do anything with it except call mommy . I 'm putting a sewing machine on my Christmas Wish List ! ( I 'm sure said mommy would be thrilled to get me one . ) : ) <p> One of my resolutions at the start of this year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sewing machine a little while back and it sat in the corner of my " crafting space " intimidating me most of the time . I come from a long line of sewing women and finally decided that I did n't  want this craft to pass me by . I have spent a lot of time on the machine this past year . I had no idea it would be so fun , although there were times I got so frustrated I thought about throwing it out the window . Hee hee . <p> Its like I 've built a relationship with this machine . I enjoy playing with it and getting to know all the ends and outs . I am no where close to being a sewing master , but look forward to continuing to learn . Sitting in front of it with the warm light from the tiny bulb , I feel connected to a long line of marvelous women before me . <p> So dust off those machines and get to work ! You cant beat the warmth and love of a handmade treasure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home dec is my least favourite sewing because if I cant wear it its not as fun to make ! <p> However your blog is so inspirational that I 'm making over my sons room which may or may not include some sewing ! Anyway to expand on your rethreading tip , I also find changing the needle solves a lot of problems I do n't  know why , sometimes even when I 'm using a relatively new needle , if I get into problems , changing the needle usually fixes the problem ! <p> Craigslist is a GREAT resource for durable mechanical machines , which are the workhorse of home dec . For less than $100 bucks you could probably get a machine in a table and get it serviced ! <p> My mother taught me to sew and I 'm eternally grateful . I was the middle child in a struggling family with eight siblings , and an older sister who was much taller and five years older than me , so I did n't  even get hand-me-downs . I sewed my own clothes in order to have any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do sew all kinds of home decor and craft items . My Singer machine is almost 50 years old and still going strong ! I also have the wrought-iron base from my mothers pedal machine which I repurposed as a side table and it reminds me always of my mom , who passed away many years ago . <p> Thanks for all the tips ! I 've never cleaned my sewing machine ( I got it from my neighbour earlier in the year , and she had just had it serviced ) but now I know I can ! Plus my mom gave me a mini screw driver set ; perfect ! <p> I 'm always a bit shocked to find out how many people havent learned how to sew . My mom taught me when I was about 8 years old and almost everyone in 6th grade took Home Ec . I spent a lot of time making outfits for my dolls . I think its such a valuable skill to learn . Repairing clothing , hemming jeans , sewing pillows &amp; drapes , costumes , designing my own bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I 'm the mom and my two boys ( ages 9 &amp; 5 ) have already had their first sewing lessons and made little drawstring bags . I want them to grown up &amp; be able to hem their own pants if they want . To this day , I still use my moms old Singer and my boys are learning on it , just like I did . My mom passed away several years before they were born , so it makes me feel like I 'm at least passing on a little part of her to them . <p> Love this post ! My mother gave me her mothers sewing machine a few years back , and even spent time during one Christmas visit sewing a duvet cover with me , so that I would feel confident enough sewing on my own . Its been a few years now , and Ive definitely improved my technique and become confident enough to sew more than just pillow covers . I 've sewn curtains/drapes , roman shades , dog bed covers , bench seat covers , and now I am getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dining room chairs . <p> My biggest piece of advice to any non-professional sewer is to purchase a template of sorts-i.e. , a $6 roman shade from Ikea , a $10 chair slipcover from Ikeato get an idea of how to assemble one on your own . <p> TIMING IS EVERYTHING ! ! ! ! Kate , you could n't have written this at a better time . Less than two weeks ago , I told my husband that " all I want for x-mas is a sewing machine . " No , I can not sew but yes , I can learn . And I know that I 'll be teaching myself to sew so these tips are perfect ! <p> Since we 've begun our FIRST HOME MAKEOVER journey , I cant tell you how many times I 've wished I had a sewing machine . I 've dreamed up so many kick-ass pillows and drapes in my headand owning a sewing machine will make my dreams a reality . <p> I 've recently discovered your blog and have enjoyed reading about your many projects . You are very talented ! Thanks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that you have mastered sewing the things you like after learning to sew as an adult ( as opposed to sewing for your whole life ) . I have long wanted to sew , but feel like its too difficult for me . So this post is great inspiration for me to learn soon . So many blogs are so wonderful I never thought I could build furniture , but thanks to ana-white.com , I 've already built floating shelves and a coffee table . So perhaps sewing is in my future after all , thanks to your blog ! <p> Great post , I was gifted a old sewing machine , I did n't  know how to use it . For a long period of time I choose to stich by hand . Finally one day I got on youtube , and typed how to thread a sewing machine , and experiment with all the different types of stiches . Now I have upgraded to a newer model , and I use it all the time . Great investment ! ! ! ! ! <p> Kate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sew when I was young . As a matter of fact , I took 4 years of Home Ec in high school and my first major in college was in the Home Economics department . I ended up with a Computer Science degree but my first love is still all things domestic . When I first got out of college , I had no money and needed suits to wear so I made them and could do such a good job that the clothes looked high end with hidden zippers , bound buttonholes and pattern matching . You could find excellent fabric back then and now it is difficult to find really good clothing fabric to sew . Most of my sewing these days is for the house and I have made many pillow covers to swap out in my rooms for seasonal decorating . And I 've used napkins as well because the fabrics are beautiful ! I have a sewing machine and a serger and use both a lot . My mom still has her original black Singer and she just gave me a dress and jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on having it put in a shadow box to preserve it . Thanks for the wonderful post ! <p> And I 've made a lot of use of those years of Home Ec because I love to cook , sew , needlepoint , and keep a clean house and have also put my year of shop class to use making frames and doing some small furniture pieces . <p> I really loved this post . Thanks so much . I grew up learning how to sew and its always been pretty easy for me ( except sewing clothesgrrr ) , but I teach a sewing class once a month to some girls from church and sometimes its like pulling teeth trying to convince them that sewing is n't as hard as they think it is . This was a good read . And its good to hear from a self-taught sewer . : ) <p> My patient mother taught me to sew when I was an elementary schooler in 4-H . Needless to say , I loved picking out my pattern and its fabric for my fair project but I hated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute my mom left me alone I would jame up my bobbin or sew the arms of my jumper to the crotch area . <p> Howerver , now I am so thankful that I learned the basics . I have progressed by leaps and bounds in my sewing abilities through my adventures in the blogosphere . I am a very visual learner and the welcoming abundance of excellent web tutorials has helped me create numerous sewing projects within the past few years . <p> Now I love to sew for my daughter and for our home . We are on a very limited buget , but I have champagne taste and want to decorate our new home with the best . Sewing has helped me be able to afford the window treatments and accessories I would normally have not been able to purchase . I also love that sewing let 's me express my creativity and put my vision into everything I create . <p> My favorite project I have sewn lately are some beautiful matelasse fabric roller shades for my daughters room . I love them and am amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely professional . Please take a look . <p> Great post . I am not a seamstress , but I do know enough to sew my own pillows and curtains , and I have been glad on so many occasions for that knowledge ( not to mention the fact that I have saved bundles . ) <p> AWESOME post ! ! ! Both of my grandmothers were excellent seamstresses , but my mom and aunts seem to have let the skills lapse . I wish I 'd had someone ( with patience ! ) to teach me . <p> I bought a sewing machine about a year and a half ago because I wanted to learn how to do some simple projects for things around the house . I took the " how to thread your machine " hour lesson from the shop that came with the purchase of my machine and played around with it some . A friend helped me with my first big project ( a skirt for a table makeover ) , and I can do some straight lines now . ; ) <p> I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , my hubby is the button sewer in the family ! But more and more I wish I couldfor the reasons you saidyummy fabric spotted that I can turn into something ! Ive been able to make it work with stitch-witchery so fartable runners , drapes , and even a poorly executed pillow . My main problem with a sewing machine would be where to set it up and use it ! ! ? ? <p> Sewing is my " thang " along with doing all things housy . When my 2nd baby girl came home from Guatemala I quickly realized that I could n't afford to dress them in all those boutiquey outfits , SO I taught myself to sew . I started with a little machine from Walmart but have now moved on to a Babylock Ellure I LOVE it . I do splurge on designer fabrics , but my girls look like no one else . I also feel such pride when people comment on their clothes I think sewing is an art , and its one of my favorite outlets for creativity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sewing since I was 6 , I want to encourage all of you younger ladies to learn to sew . Over my lifetime , I have saved a ton of money of window treatments and pillows alone not to mention my childrens little outfits , flower girl dresses , etc , when they were young . One time , many years ago , I made 8 outfits for my family for a luau in Hawaii ! I 'm now on my second sewing machine in 30 years and I just get the cheaper models . They last a long time and are worth every dime . <p> It is like you are in my head . I am just now learning to sew and a sewing machine is definitely on my Christmas list this year . I get so excited going into fabric stores and thinking about what I am going to make for our home . : - ) <p> Thank you ! I am can sew a straight line , and have managed some duvets , etc. , but I really want to be able to sew clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reading that you actually broke out the manual and watched some online tutorials is inspirational ! <p> Great article and in such a timely manner for me ! I 've wanted to sew for years , and finally got a machine for my birthday 2 years ago and havent sewn a thing out of fear that it would be too hard , or that " i do n't  have time to learn " . My days are pretty full between my little guy with autism and a 5mth old baby , but i have vowed that this holiday season I NEED a little break once a week away from the kids to relax and do some crafting and sewing ! I may have to hire a sitter to get this break since my hubby works 70+hours a week but i 'm gon na get it ! ! ! <p> This couldnt have come at a better time . My mom owned an interior design company and has been sewing all her adult life . But I never had any interest until recently . She got me my first sewing machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic sewing lessons in December . Woo-hoo ! I cant wait ! It will also be some great mother-daughter bonding time to sew together . <p> Please , please , please do NOT buy a new " cheap " sewing machine ( I believe any new machine that is less than $200 is probably not worth your while ) . Take it from someone who has been sewing for 45 years . You will be so much happier with an older machine that has been refurbished . Ask for used sewing machines at a sewing machine dealership ; they will have been cleaned , repaired , and usually have a warranty . Dpnt buy from Craigslist or Ebay unless you have someone with you who can check out the machine . <p> The sewing machines that are being targeted for new sewists are poorly made and poorly designed . They will not stand up to continued use and often have problems that lead to a new sewist hating to sew . You will not enjoy the process if you do n't  have adequate equipment . <p> I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't  know how to use it . I really want to take classes so that I can actually use the darn thing and make some sweet projects like yours ! <p> Oh , man . I keep saying I am going to get my sewing machine out and put together a few projects . Thank you for the inspiration to drag it out of the closet and read the instructions again . Going to do that this evening when everything quiets down . I used to sew with my grandmother when I was young aprons , small baby quilts and a few simple dresses . Oh , those were fun times marking the fabric with the patterns , cutting out the fabric and seeing our creations come alive . <p> The fabric in the closet is calling me to re-cover some pillows and finally make some curtains for the laundry room . Thanks for the excitement ! ! <p> Thank you so much for this post ! I have been wanting to sew for such a long time and just never had the courage to learn , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me want to purchase a sewing machine and really give a try ! Thanks for the inspiration : ) <p> My stepmom did upholstery when I was a kid ( like 11-18 years old ) . She recovered box pillows and redid car interiors and boats and all kinds of things . I do n't  think she enjoyed it much because she does n't  do it anymore , but OH how I wish I had asked her to teach me . I 'm not sure if she would have or not because she always seemed to be in a rush , but I would have loved to learn . Even then , I think I would have loved it . <p> My favorite sewing projects include a dress I made for myself , ( that the hubby got me the fabric for valentines day : ) and some curtains I made for my daughters room . I 'm not the best seamstress but people thought I had bought them ! <p> What a great post . I am self taught on the sewing machine and have always just figured things out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use many of them . My first sewing machine was given to me by a family friend . They were moving and were not taking their Singer sewing machine with them . I learned on that old machine . A few years ago my husband bought me a brand new machine which has made sewing just so much easier . I love making pillows . They are so simple but can completely transform a space . I have used napkins to make pillows as well . I also have used some of my kids clothing that no longer fits them to make crafts . Sewing something always makes me happy . Thanks again for your amazing post . <p> My mother went to a small very rural high school and a lot of her studies revolved around home life so she 's sewed for most of her life and of course she passed that on to me . My mother was always sewing something was I was younger and I wanted to be just like her . I love to sew I just do n't  always have the time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peach costume last year , I got so many compliments and felt awesome in my own creation . Thanks for sharing these tips , I 'm sure I 'll look back on a few ! <p> I am from the generation that took sewing in school . I loved it so much I went on to sew most of my clothes for many years . Many of us sewers were distressed in the 90s because it looked like sewing was going to disappear but thanks to women and men in their 20s and 30s it has been brought back to life . A big thanks to all of those who are taking up a wonderfully rewarding , useful , and just plain fun hobby . Now , taking a break from the working world , I have the time to sew to make a few bucks here and there , to improve my home , and make some nice gifts for friends and family . We all benefit from people taking up the craft better fabrics and supplies , patterns , etc so I say the more the merrier ! Just remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , many , many projects to learn the craft well , but what a fun journey it is . You 'll rip out miles of seams , put aside projects midstream never to pick them up again but its worth it . Enjoy . <p> Okay I am now very inclined to ask for ( or maybe even treat myself to ) a sewing machine ! I 've wanted to learn for years , have said to myself several times " If only I could sew that myself " , and even worked in a fabric store to help pay my way through college ( where I drooled over fabrics and imagined myself madly sewing beautiful creations for a home I did n't  even own yet ! ) . This was the perfect kick in the pants to get me going ! ! p.s . LOVE those pillows ! ! <p> I have always seen fabric or pillows in various stores and wanted to make my own but never thought I could . I always thought " it was too hard " to sew but I am totally inspired now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sewing machine this year . Thanks for the amazing post and confidence booster . <p> I learned to sew on my mothers old Kenmore . It was noisy and only had a few stitchs to pick from . It really was all I needed . I later upgraded and now have a computerized brother and although it is much quieter and has a huge array of stitches I still miss that Kenmore . It represented the sewer that I became . <p> I watched my grandmother growing up , but never really learned . The best thing I did for myself was to sign up at a local fabric store and take a basic class with a girlfriend . It got me started . Ive been able to create many things with a simple straight stick . My favorite would be the throw quilts I made for both of my daughters when they were younger . <p> I never learned to sew as a kid either , but my MIL gave me her mothers 50s era Singer . I read the manual and now I would never ever give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me decorate every room in my house . I tried to make clothes a few times all flops . I stick to home decor . My best- Diane <p> The best project I sewed was my wedding dress . I designed it myself . I enjoyed using a gorgeous lace from Italy that 19 years ago was $200/yard ! <p> I started sewing when I was 4 , sewing buttons onto anything and everything . I progressed to draping fabric on my Barbie dolls and sewing outfits . Then my mom taught me how to use the sewing machine when I was 10 ( she was a sewer extrodinaire ) . In high school I took tailoring and design . After university while pregnant with my first I took non credit courses at a fashion design school . I have sewn everything , 15 flower girl dresses for both sister and SILs weddings , fitted slipcovers , pillows , baby clothes , cloth diapers , Barbie/doll clothes for my girls , lined pinch pleat drapes , the list can go on ! <p> I love going to fabric stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture of fabric . I love it . My hubby bought me a Kennore sewing machine as a wedding gift , it has served me well . I always tell my friends if you can follow directions and sew a straight line you can sew ! <p> Thanks for this post , nice to see there are " others " out there as well <p> Such a great and informative post ! I have just one thing to add , the iron is a sewers best friend . do n't  skip ironing your fabric or ironing down your seams ! It will make the actual sewing so much easier ! Every time I rush and skip this step I regret it ! <p> I think I am the winner here in terms of longevity . I have been sewing since I was 11 , fifty three years . I know how to tailor , make my own clothes , etc. etc . Even though I knew what I was doing , I would run into trouble . My pillows would n't be square , I would get a complete mess underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  have enough pressure on the pressure foot , and sometimes the tensions werent right . ALL THAT CHANGED when I started sewing on a Bernina . It was a miracle . You become a much better sewer with a Bernina . Its like BUTTA . Anyway , I bought one , then got a serger with a rolled edge feature and another Bernina , and a Bernina serger . I have made thousands of napkins for myself and to sell for charity , besides all sorts of other things . If you are going to buy a machine , do not get a cheap one . The beginning Bernina is $500-600 . It is not computerized . You do n't  need a computer unless you are going into the little kids embroidery business . If you are buying one secondhand , make the person sit down and sew a few seams , Inspect the work , top and bottom . It should be perfect . If not , you need a tune up which could cost $75 and up . If you can find one , look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lots of machines for resale and can steer you to a good one . It really pays to take a course . You will learn so much , you wo n't believe it . It also helps in the stress department . Supplies : Always buy good pins . Do not use the ones that come on the shirts you buy . Those are nails . Buy decent scissors and hide them from your family . Do not cut paper with your scissors . Buy good fabric . You will spend a lot of time sewing . It is not worth it to sew on cheap fabric . Get out your iron . Everything is easier if you iron . Take your time . I have made every mistake in the book because I was trying to hurry and take short cuts . Do n't  be a fabric whore . Buy something and make something . Do n't  have a huge stash of fabric . That will annoy your family and make you feel guilty . Enjoy . If you learn to sew , it will give you a lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle characteristics when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew ; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied . Nathaniel Hawthorne The Marble Faun <p> I treasure the fact that my Mum taught me to sew from an early age and now I am teaching my eldest daughter to sew as well . I was so proud of her last week when she finished her first hand sewn effort . <p> I asked my Husband for a sewing machine for my birthday the first year we were married , and that little basic Janome has paid for itself many times over . Like most newly married couples we had little money and lots of hand-me-down furniture and not much else I made curtains and bedcovers , cushion covers and tableclothes for our first home together and then when our two little darlings came along I made cute little dresses , burp clothes , bibs , quilts , toys and play rugs ! Yesterday I was looking at some photos of my eldest at Kindy and thought " what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the many I made for her at that age . <p> Working full time I do n't  always have the time to make all the things I would like to , but recently I have pulled my machine out to work on several projects , and I am enjoying it so much ! <p> Your post today gave me just the encouragement I need to go out and get a sewing machine , Kate ! I have been going around and around for while on whether or not I could learn to sew . I have been drooling over fabrics and have so many ideas in my head but needed a push to just go for it . So , thank you for your post today ! Now I just need to figure out what basic sewing machine to buy . I do n't  want a super fancy one . Your pillows are beautiful gorgous colors . Very elegant . <p> This was so encouraging ! ! I have never sewn before , but for the last few weeks have really been up in the air about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it was too much work . I am on a mission to become an avid DIYer and I MUST know how to sew to make this work ! ! So this was exactly what I needed to read ! ! I have just one thing on my Christmas list this year , The Brother CS6000I Sewing Machine ! ! ! ! Well that , and maybe some jo-ann gift cards ! ! ! Thanks Kate ! ! ! <p> I am also in the process of teaching myself to sew . It has been fun and rewarding but sometimes very frustrating too . My favorite projects are the drapes and pillows Ive made . My least favorite project is the slipcovers I am making for my wingback chairs . Unlike the drapery panels and pillows , they have lots of curvy lines and tons of different seams . Very slow and tedious work . I really like sewing the pillows because I can get a few together in the time my baby is napping and they can completely change the look of a room . <p> THANK YOU so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the fence about this very topic just recently , since Halloween actually . Ive been " taught " to sew numerous times in my life , by my mother , my grandmother and my home economics teacher . Never once did it " stick " . This past Halloween I wanted my youngest son to be The Very Hungry Caterpillar . I searched far and wide , but could not find a pre-made costume anywhere ! So , I was either going to have to make it or find another costume for him . I had actually settled on the fact that I would sew the entire costume by hand Until I ran out of time ! It was three days before Halloween &amp; he still did not have a costume . I remembered the trusty little hand held $10 machine that my sister in law had given to me several years ago ( which I had never even opened ) . So at 9:00 the night before we were leaving for a family Halloween weekend out of town ( when I should have been packing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievably rewarding it was to have that finished little costume ! I had been thinking it would be nice to have a little bit better than a $10 machine , so it was going on my Christmas list . Ive been back and forth on this for a week now , but after seeing your simple little pillow tutorial , and thinking about all the other great things I could make , I think I will do it ! I 'll ask , and hope that I receive .. Thank you ! <p> My stepmom taught me how to sew when I was in junior high &amp; high school and when I graduated in 95 , my grandma gave me a Brother sewing machine . I logged many hours on that machine making quilts and other home dec projects ! More recently , my step mom passed her Elna on to me after she got a new one and WOW ! This is a great machine ! I have been making baby projects lately for friends ( quilts , crib bumpers , blankers , etc. ) and it has really been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dresses for my little sisters ( when they were 3 &amp; 4 ) , dresses for myself . The only bad part is that when I am out shopping and trying on clothes , I always look at how I can fix it to fit me right ! <p> Fabric I am totally loving right now is Amy Butler . She uses bright , happy colors and with fun patterns . I made one of her bags ( Birdie Sling ) as gifts and they were great ! Moda also makes some similar fabrics . <p> I would love to learn to sew but I think I would need to take a class . I do n't  think I would have the patience to maintain the concentration to do it myself . I would probably give up before I ever got anywhere ! I should see if there are sewing classes around me . It would be nice to make my own stuff rather than buying so much manufacturer items . <p> I so agree with you when it comes to the best , quality machine that can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never use . In HS I had to take home-ec and I got a C in sewing because I used iron-on seam binding to hem my skirtlol Later when we lived in ItalyI rented a sewing machine for $7.00 a day from the base to sew my curtains for the 7 double doors to our balconies . Since thenIve been hooked and actually burned out the motor to my first Singerit was such a workhorseI loved it and they do n't  make them like they use to ; ) <p> Thanks for this , especially the beginners machine review . I completely know what you mean about looking at a project and thinking , " All this needs is a new cover ! " quickly followed by , " Oh , right , I cant sew . " I might just take the plunge . <p> Thanks for the inspiration ! Ive been wanting to learn to sew for a couple years ( never learned from my mom ) , but was a little intimidated to learn on my own . Looking forward to reading your suggestions/tips . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made all my clothes and school dance dresses while in high school and even sewed my first wedding dress and made my husband a suit . Now I mainly sew home decor like drapes , curtains and bed decor . I 'm so glad I have that skill . I do feel sad that it has gone out of vogue . Does anyone else here recall the days where sometimes you had to wait on someone to get up from a chair at the pattern books so you could sit down ? It was that popularnow I find no one at the pattern books . : ( <p> Awesome post ! I am currently using the sewing machiene that my grandmother gave my mother . It is old-iron heavy-a 1960s aqua green workhorse . There are lots of nicer newer models with fancier options-but I cant give up the nostalgia of sewing away on the same machiene I grew up watching my mom sew some of my clothes on ! <p> Kate , Thank you , thank you , thank you for this post ! My mom taught me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't  listen . This post is exactly what I needed . I 'm off to YouTube to learn how to clean my machine . I do have the CS6000i and love it . <p> Yay for sewing machines ! It is a mission of mine to encourage our generation to break out those sewing machines and not be intimidated about using them ! I did this post a while back to help people get started with a sewing machine for the first time : <p> It includes links to videos showing how to thread a machine and get started as well as a great website that has free threading diagrams and manuals to most sewing machines ( even the old ones that have been passed down to many of us ! ) . <p> There 's so much that can be accomplished with just the basic ability to turn the machine on and run a straight stitch ! <p> Can you just clarify something for me ? Do you sew the overlapped edges together AND velcro them ? or do you pin them first and after sewing all sides together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought napkins thinking I would do the same.and never get around to making them . I see sooo many cool fabrics for napkins and on clearance at TJ Maxx or Mashalls for like $4 bucks-usually for 4 napkins you can make two pillows-who does n't  want $2 pillows ! ! ! <p> Its not often you find a fellow sewer ( looks like sewer so maybe seamstress is better ! ) You might enjoy our blog at **32;1009;TOOLONG that offers both decorating and sewing advice and ideas . <p> Now these are good tips , I 've been sewing for a zillion years and havent thought about the specifics in forever , it just becomes second nature ! This is sure to help newbies and provide some good reminders for the rest of us ! Janell <p> What a timely post I literally just bought my first sewing machine this week ! For years I had zero interest in learning to sew but now am very interested in making home decor items and other crafts . These tips are wonderful . I will be printing them out for future reference thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea what brands of thread are considered good quality . Any one have their favorites ? <p> When we built our house , I looked at patterns for window treatments soooo expensive that I decided to just wing it . All my window treatments turned out great , I used vintage tableclothes for some , nothing too fancy or elaborate , and they looked professionally done . I always do better sewing something that comes straight from my head or my sketches I can not follow a pattern to save my life ! : ) <p> Wow ! What a great idea to use napkins for pillow covers ! Ive been searching for new pillows for my living room , and havent been able to find something i like , in a price that i would want to pay . I 'm definitely going to be keeping my eyes open at napkins ! Thanks for the great tips ! ! <p> My mother is the most beautiful seamstress . However she never taught me to sew either ! By the time I 'd have been interested , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally learned in college . My favorite project at the moment is my Ballard Knock-off Bag Holder in linen . I love how it turned out ! <p> Awesome post ! Thank you both . I begged my husband for a sewing machine when I decided to become a homemaker . He bought one as a gift weeks later and it stayed in the box over a year unopened . I meet an awesome woman that made purses and she sat down with me and helped me take to sewing machine out the box and overcome the fear of messing up . That weekend I made an apron . I have been unstoppable for 6 months now , until I ran out of ideas of things to sew : ( The idea never even crossed my mind to use napkins for pillow covers . Maybe now I will make a square pillow LOL ! Anyone with project ideas please send them my way ! <p> I learnt to sew in my early teens , with help from my Mum on her old Singer . I started out making some calico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more importantly they were cheap and if I messed them up it was n't a huge loss . When I left High School the first thing I bought was a Singer sewing machine for the whopping price of $199. that was a LOT way back then <p> Years later when I moved around with work , my sewing machine was the first item that got packed in my car . I still have it and its still going strong . My girlfriend has a new machine with all the bells and whistles and has tried to talk me into getting a new one.but I love my old singer because it holds so many memories . I have bought myself an overlocker though . That 's a sensational addition ! <p> I recently got fed up with my pillows and junk on view for all to see . I have a hand-me-down sewing machine that I 'd never used . I got it down from its perch , way above me in a tall bookcase , dusted it off , watched a few online tutorials and dove into sewing curtain panels to cover our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Day , coincidentally ) , I transformed our tiny apartment and later blogged about it : LONG ... <p> I absolutely love to sew anything ! I learned as a kid in home ec but never really did much . Both my mom and my grandmother sewed too but I never did more than the basics with them . As an adult , I bought my first machine when I moved out on my own . Over the last 28 years , Ive become more adept and I have a lot more patience to really take my time and do it right . My favorite things to sew are costumes for my daughters ( dress-up and Halloween ) but I also sew removable pillow covers and various home wares . Its nice to get some fresh fabric and change out my things seasonally , it feels like a new house every few months . Now my daughters are asking to learn . I cant wait to introduce them to the wonderful world of sewing , it opens so many options and will be a life-long benefit . : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My mom was an amazing seamstress ! You could make anythingcurtains , wedding dresses , bedding , barbie doll clothes . I loved falling asleep to the sound of a sewing machine . She taught me enough to help me do easy sewing projects . I now own her very nice sewing machine and serger . I have never used a serger before , but I am wanting to learn how . I also have her embroidery machine . I am hoping to take a class on how to use it after Christmas . There is just no better feeling that making something by hand , do n't  ya think ? I love your napkin pillow . I made some from Christmas napkins last year and they turned out great . I always like to look for discounted napkins after holidays . Super frugal , I am ! : ) Hope you are doing well . Did you say you were going to Blissdom ? I hope to see you there . Traci <p> Thanks for sharing this with us . I 've quite loved the experience of reading your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botton would be a useful addition to summarize the lessons regardless I will be visiting back here so keep up the delightful writing , your readers appreciate it . <p> I have been sewing for over 30 years , each new project is exciting . Home dec projects are my favorite because I can see it everyday . Unlike laundry and dishes a sewing project has a definite end ! Your pillows are great , the only thing I would add is just a bit of batting in the corners to " fill " it out . And you are quite right about a good machine , it makes all the difference . <p> I took a short series of beginner sewing classes after my first child was born and it was a great investment . I 've made numerous window treatments and pillows over the years , but my favorite projects are the Halloween costumes I sewed for my kids , the pink princess dress , the Humpty Dumpty suit and the little clown costume that both my children wore for their first Halloween are so special to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkins together before you sewed their edges . Can you explain it in a little more detail ? Im having a hard time visualizing . ( And I 'd love to make my own pillows . ) <p> I learned how to sew when I was about 8 or 9 . I wanted one of those kiddie sewing machines I saw in the Sears catalog bright pink , 100% plastic . Instead , my mother took me into the laundry/sewing room , showed me how to do the basic stitches on her machine ( a tank of a Kenmore ) , showed me her stash of fabrics , and said " go for it . " Ive been sewing ever since . ( She did did the same thing when I begged for an Easy-Bake oven ) . When I got married , instead of paying someone gobs of cash to sew my dress , I bought a decent sewing machine and sewed the dress myself I still have that machine . I 've sewn my own clothes , my kids clothes , Halloween costumes , quilts and duvet covers , window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love fixing up great old furniture for the cost of fabric and trim . <p> There are so many great online classes and tutorials out there on websites and YouTube for specific techniques ! <p> Thanks for sharing the great tips . I 'll remember to change the needles instead of adjusting the tension . I 've had my machine over 30 years and often think its the tensions fault when it probably was just the needle after all . I love to sew pillows because you can hide your boo boos inside the pillows lol . <p> I have to protest your choice of machine for a beginner . The absolute worst kind of machine is one that has so much computer hardware in it . I work in a costume shop at my college with machines with computers in them and they are always the things that break and by far the most expensive things to fix . Where as my mothers all mechanical is easily 3-decades old by now and is still a freaking work horse . <p> I just tried sewing these napkins I found into pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend trying this , such a quick , easy and affordable way to transform any space . <p> I do want to share that the fabric of the napkins I picked out ( 100% cotton ) wrinkled easily so if I had to do it again I would prob pay more attention to the fabric . Hubby rested on pillow once and it was covered with wrinkles . <p> I did n't  learn as a kid although my mom is an expert . A few years back my DH bought me that same brother machine and its worked like a dream . I 'm not an expert yet , but I hope to get better . Thanks for the tips ! <p> I 'm so grateful for the tip about which sewing machine to buy thank you so much ! I plan to buy one for my daughter for Christmas and you just saved me hours of research . And Kate , I love the sweater pillow idea ; maybe thatll be our first project with the new machine . <p> What is a high quality thread ? I 've just started sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Rod Pocket Panel tutorial . But I keep getting the birdsnest effect and my thread keeps breaking . Ugh ! I bought some thread at Walmart ( it was all they had ) , but I think its just cheap . What should I look for to get a high quality thread ? ? Thanks ! ! <p> I know this post is older but your advice on learning to sew was fabulous . I cant tell you how many times I have shared those same words of wisdom with others who are learning to sew . The taking your time tip was probably the best one . It has taken me over 20 years to develop my skills and I continue to learn all the time . Thanks so much for sharing what I hope to be a resurging art . 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057779 @3257779/ <h> Me and IKEA , Its Complicated <p> By Kate Riley January 4 , 2011 <p> I 'm helping a friend style a wall of family photographs , so naturally for picture frames , one goes to IKEA . It takes me over an hour to get to the closest store , and I have to plan to spend at least half a day or more of my time on an IKEA excursion . In winter , in the rain , it is a complete hassle , but with all those deals to be had , I make the trip twice a year . <p> IKEA and I have a complicated relationship . Every time I pass one , I long to go in , and consider it complete torture to pass one on the freeway without stopping . Once I 'm in , I go through a series of emotions . First , frustration at the miles of parking lots , tens of thousands of square footage to navigate , glaring florescent lights , and the disturbing feeling we 're all being herded like cattle . Moooo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional daycare that greets you at the door . Clearly , this is a store designed to trap you and your children inside for hours at at time . That , or they 're just tired of cleaning up broken vases on Aisle 242 . <p> Then comes the anxiety that sets in trying to follow all those blue signs with all the arrows pointing you to go here or there . It 's quite a disturbing labyrinth and it frightens me so . <p> Anxiety is always followed by hunger requiring that I get in the long line to wait to dine on their Swedish meatballs . Once revived , I experience the delight of scoring some pretty good deals on some cheap goods . <p> Last weekend , I made my semiannual trip . When I arrived , it was daylight . When I left , darkness had set in , but this is to be expected when one travels to IKEA . I spent a few hours poking around , inspecting all the furniture , linens and fixtures and found some things I liked . For fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 23100 @qwx883100 <h> 185 comments <p> Love IKEA and we live about 10 minutes from it ( do n't  hate me ) . Its really nice that I can drop in to get little organizational things or cheap drinking glasses whenever we need them . As far as their furniture goes , I feel like you have to be careful to mix it up with other ( not the kind from flat boxes ) styles , or you end up with a college dorm look . <p> I just made my semi yearly trip to Ikea last week . I took family from maine there . We had a good time and found lots of great stuff , including a great shelf to go above my office desk , but I ended up driving 45 minutes home with a horrible headache . I too have a love hate relationship with ikea . <p> This hits home for me because I always say I have a Love/Hate Relationship with IKEA . My closest store is a 3 1/2 hour drive , so I go twice a year &amp; take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef with IKEA is that , by the time I 've reached the warehouse/Self-Serve area with my crazy-long list of selections made throughout the day , I 'm tired , its late , and I 'm ready to be out of there . Instead , I struggle to push a full cart or two PLUS a flat bed and load insanely large , heavy boxes . Then , inevitably , box 2 or 3 of my " 4-box item " is out of stock . One piece of a big-ticket selection is ALWAYS out of stock . And calling ahead to check stock is a feat in itself . Oh , and those ridiculous carts that steer like they are on ice ! ! : - ) But , I love the place enough that I continue to go twice a year &amp; come home with a full van . <p> Its definitely love/hate . The first time I went , I was exhausted . When we finally found our way to the warehouse section , my whole body was trembling , hair frazzled , and stomach grumbling . However , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret to Ikea . Find a few items and pair them with things from other stores . I do n't  think I can handle an entire Ikea room . Right now , my favorite pieces are the ornate oval frame hanging above our mantle and the candle/light chandelier . Its a great source of light for our small apartment and on special occasions we turn out the lights and light the candles . Its great ! <p> Ikea came to charlotte a little over a year ago and it was like Oprah and Billy Graham descended into the cityat the same time . I enjoy its concepts and designs . I 'm not fond of some of its furniture pieces . However , Ikea has successfully help me outfit my windows . I will be sharing that on my blogso do stop by this week . <p> I LOVE IKEAread a post somewhere yesterday about it too . I consider this Gods sign to me that I should go on Saturday . ; ) We have one about 45 minutes North , but they only let you stick you older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 minutes at a time . I make the best of those 25 minutes ! Luckily , my kids like it there too . : ) <p> Can you believe I saw that gorgeous white coffee table at the Salvation Army last year and I did n't  bring it home with me ? ? What was I thinking ? ! <p> Used to love . Moving toward hate . I feel as though their prices have gone way up in the last few years , and the quality has not followed suit . Their stuff is always so recognizable , everyone ends up with the same things . Maybe I am just getting older , but i find myself preferring to buy one really good heirloom-quality item at a flea market or antique store instead of a van load of " meh , this will work . " <p> I LOVE Ikea . I used to live 15 minutes away and it was so handy . There were many trips where I would just wander the showroom without buying anything , but just to get ideas . They are masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I hear ya about their cattle corrals but now I know all the shorcuts so it does n't  seem so bad . <p> Now that I have a kid , I love it even more . When it is too hot/wet/cold to go outside , its great to take her there to hang for an hour or two . We have lunch , she plays in the lunch play area . We go to the kids area and she plays there a bit . I always end up chatting with other parents doing the same thing . <p> Shoot , even if they did n't  have the play areas she would be happy to go and sit on every single couch and bed . And yes , I make she takes off her shoes before getting in the beds , and we make them up once she gets out . <p> My one big beef not everything is in the warehouse . I forgot to get childrens hangers once and by the time we were in the warehouse there was no way I was backtracking . <p> i also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3 hours away . i try to make it at least once , if not twice a year . Its definitely an adventure to say the least . And I really have to want/love something before I buy it , because there 's no way I 'm driving all the way back to return it ! ! <p> I love IKEA . It makes me long for a 452 sq ft. apartment that holds just me and maybe a cat . Then , reality sets in and my beeper from the daycare goes off and 2 of my 3 boys need to be picked up . Of course , this always happens before I even get to the actual Marketplace . So , I have to steer those darn carts with all 3 boys ( who complain and/or lose all sense of manners and decorum ) through the maze of departments to gather what seemed ABSOLUTELY necessary only moments before . By the checkout , my patience is shot , I 'm in a full sweat and my boys want a snackoh and they did n't  have the big item that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour for me to get to an IKEA . Its totally worth the drive . When I do score the big sale or get the room I want , I am in Nirvana . Its the other stuff that makes that ride home feel a bit longer and a whole lot more questionable ! <p> I definitely LOVE Ikea , but you have to prepare and know what you need GO WITH A PLAN ! Over the years , I 've made many trips and scored awesome items , but its definitely overwhelming if you just go to browse . Sadly to say , I do n't  live too close to an Ikea anymore , and definitely miss it . Thanks for sharing the great vignettes , Kate ! <p> I TOTALLY understand ! ! ! When I had to drive to Emeryville for IKEA it was n't as much fun . Now there 's one in West Sacramento , so I can go everyday if I choose ; ) Its quite lovely , too . Not as crowded as Emeryville ; ) Since Im able to go frequently , I 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anxiety ! ! <p> The first time I took my husband there he panicked a little when he realized it was built like a maze and kept asking where the dragon and troll were hiding . <p> We have a regional store or some such about twenty minutes away . Thats IKEAs way of saying our store does n't  carry the full assortment of IKEA goods . But they do carry a good assortment of stuff , and we go every few months to pick up things . <p> I always like seeing the new displays , and the kitchen section has become my favorite since I used their kitchen planner to redesign our kitchen , so I now drool every time I 'm there wondering when we will get around to a remodel . <p> I love Ikea ! ! I especially love their TV ad where the wife is yelling at her husband ( who is waiting in the car reading a newspaper ) " Start the car ! ! ! Start the car ! ! ! " when she thinks that her bill has been undercalculated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kind of meh but not for long ! Construction is underway to make it bigger and better . When completed , itll be the largest in IKEA in Canada , so I 'm planning to get lost in there at least a few times a year . Ca n't wait . The online fabric offerings are kind of fun . <p> I 'm a new reader but I had to post on this ! I love IKEA I used to live right down the road from it and was in heaven . Now ? I live 3+ hours away from one and havent been to it in years . Just looking at the pictures you posted makes me want to take a day trip up just for IKEA ! ! ! ! <p> I totally agree with you CG ! If I did n't  have kids and could leisurely spend a day on the trip ( 1 hour from my house ) I would n't mind so much . The day care at our IKEA only takes the kids for 30 minutes , and there is always a wait to get in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that many times I find myself having to return something . But the deals , the things that you can find there , oh my ! Yum . <p> I love IKEA now even though , years ago , I hated it and my husband and I had our big fight over our remodel in an IKEA . Note : I am sitting on the sofa he " hated " right now , LOL . I love the prices , the varied styles , and I especially love slipcovers that you can wash for a sofa ( we have the Ektorp 3 seater and I am planning a spring purchase of the new Ektorp w/built in chaise ) . <p> I am not a huge fan of modern so some of their designs leave me cold , but I love the layouts and how they mix styles . Its very inspirational . <p> I am planning a photo project right now , so I will definitely be making an IKEA trip soon . It does n't  hurt that it is only about a 20 minute drive . : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive for me , so I love it . Ours is n't that crazy either . I can even say Im starting to learn my way around atleast were all the hidden short cuts are . I only wander around the upstairs every so often usually I just go right for the main floor to get what I need . <p> I usually go with a planned shopping list . Then I figure in $40 for the random stuff I find that I really do n't  need . Ikea is like a dollar store for adults . I always check online if the big items are in stock . Oh and the clearance room is one of the best areas . Once I scored the tall skinny Malm dresser all put together for cheap . Once I met a guy in there that had completely remodeled his house based on what he found in the clearance room . <p> I think the best trip I had is when I redid my sons bedroom . Minus the can of paint , everything was from Ikea and the total cost was under $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shades , linens , etc . It was really planned out . Probably because I was pregnant , had my hubby with me and knew I was not spending any more time in that store than I had to . <p> I love IKEA . Marketing at its finest . You just can not leave without buying something . I do , however , have minor panic attacks with the maze and wonder sometimes if I should drop crumbs to find my way out . I guess that 's a small price to pay . <p> Hi Kate , Yes , IKEA , its a love/hate thing . Thankfully mostly love . Ours is about an hour away in another country ( Canada ) and so were faced with not buying too much or we get pulled over at the border ! Add that to the complicated trip ! <p> I find it helpful to memorize the catalog , then I know what to expect , somewhat . Love the neutral board you created up there . Did you get some things for your home ? Ca n't wait to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Our trip was a spontaneous one . ( Not recommended ) . I have all of the same frustrations that you do about the store , but I find that my heart beats just a little faster as I 'm pulling in the parking lot . Possibly out of anxiety , but I like to think that its the excitement of finding the perfect deal . <p> I find that my most successful trips to IKEA are after I pour over the catalogue and get a better idea of what I 'm looking for . Otherwise the store is too overwhelming for me . <p> I 'm with youmy Ikea is about 45 minutes away , love many of the finds , but careful to stay away from others . ( that wont stand the test of time , even a few minutes ! ) I did Maxs room with many items from Ikea and really happy . Love their rugs ! Janell <p> I love Ikea , and my husband is thrilled that its an hour drive in heavy traffic which does deter my going very often ! I start out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm sucked into the various room displays I become totally disoriented and wander around for hours . <p> I have an IKEA about 10 minutes away . Yeah , its a bit too convenient and my wallet frequently suffers ! With it so close , I am definitely not above using the free childrens play area to have an hours worth of quiet . I always bring a book in case I finish shopping early to get my full hours worth of peace . <p> I love that feminine room you put together ! I have a love/hate relationship with Ikea . There 's one about 30 min from me , but its out of the way and a hassle to get to . I enter the place with all these grand ideas of what I want to buy in the Marketplace , but once I 'm there I 'm often disappointed with the quality and need to assemble every darn thing in the place , and do n't  leave with very much . I bought a cute alarm clock there for our guest room and the hands moved backwards . : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had the pleasure of shopping at an Ikea Store . However , I have a running shopping list and am shooting for a goal to make it there sometime this year . The nearest one to us is literally over 4 hours awayterrible ! I 'm calling it Ikeas fault , not mine , that Ive never been to one . They need to branch out : ) <p> I agree totally with you . My problem is that it looks good on the website and in the store but I never get the same effect when I get it home . I also go crazy trying to figure out all the parts to build what I want . <p> We have a good relationship with Ikea . Were lucky to have one a few miles from our house so stopping in is like going to Target . I always wondered around aimlessly but my wife is a pro ! She knows all these secret passages and can get in , go to any section , and get out in a matter of minutes . I think she should set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell escort them safely to the exit : ) <p> I live exactly one hour and 15 minutes from IKEA Pittsburgh-I love when folks fly into Pburgh-cuz IKEA is right next door ! I laughed at your post , because those curtains in your white presentation are destined for my guest bedroom-in a gray , beige , blue sort of way ! Ill be making the pilgrimage this week or next-depending on the snow . <p> I have an IKEA about 30 minutes away , so it is easy for me to make trips there . I used to go frequently , but now only about once every 2 months or so . Luckily , I can go at 9:30 , grab some breakfast , and shop by 10 when they open , so I never park far away or wait in long lines . I never go unless it is in the morning that 's craziness ! I have a lot of IKEA stuff armchairs , dining chairs , Billy bookcases , wicker stuff , outdoor table and chairs and I have found that , when people come over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a fan of that . I do n't  want my home to look like an IKEA catalog , so I do n't  buy furniture from there anymore . But I think its great for someone just starting out or getting the decor or frames all my frames are IKEA . <p> This article is too true ! In the Chicago area we have 2 IKEAs spoiled I know . But each one is very different in the layout . The far one from me is one level and very much the maze you depicted . The one I use is right outside my office window . I see it daily . And I go there probably 2x a month to just walk around and browse ( its 3 levels high ) . They recently changed it around a bit and seeing departments is a bit more challenging than before too ( new large walls that block the view ) . But in general I do love Ikea for the low cost , good quality and good selection . I do feel the same as other posters that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . They trap you in line forever- even in the self check out . But I would have to say my #1 complaint about them is how you have to bring your car back to the buidling to get large items . The lot is huge- so bascially you have to run and hurry to get it while leaving your newly purchased items on a dock right by other open and ready to drive away cars ? It is fine if you shop with a friend but if you are alone- yikes . I can say I like that you can walk and burn off the calories of the fabulous Swedish meatballs- yum ! <p> Sigh . Ikea . I live in South Louisiana , so my options are either to drive to Houston ( 4.5 hours ) or Atlanta ( 8.5 hours ) . Oh lucky me. -- Obviously , I choose Houston . I have to admire their intelligent marketing , but I find their method of FORCING you to go to the store incredibly obnoxious . " Oh , most small items that people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Youll have to go to the store . Oh , you can by this piece of furniture online but , even though its boxed and shipped flat , the shipping will cost you more than the item itself . Maybe you should go to the store ! " As much as I like some of their items and price points ( of some , not all ) , I go only when Ive run out of other options . For example , when I needed a freestanding kitchen island , Ikeas Stenstorp was the only thing I could find that looked decent , was a nice size , and cost less than $1000 . <p> Ugh , I feel the EXACT same way ! ! I felt myself becoming snarky a few weeks ago in the self-checkout line ( who thinks that is a good idea in a store where they sell FURNITURE for petes sake ? ! ? ) and I had to take a breath but this place does that to you ! Still , I cant seem to stay away . . . : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because its what I can afford . This summer we needed bookshelves . I 've done the $30 ones from Target but they never last a move and I 've had them fall over on me too . Ikea was the solution decent , inexpensive bookshelves . Of course I 'd like to buy nicer things , but when you 're first starting out that usually is n't possible . <p> I always have to make sure Im well fed before I go , or I get super cranky ! I do n't  mind going on a weekday when its not soo crowded hubby would rather watch paint dry than go : ) . I live about 20 minutes from one and only go about one a year ! <p> I also have an IKEA close by ( 15 minutes ) . I used to be really frustrated when going through the store with the maze , but the benefit of being close is that I now know how to navigate it ! I like going after work rather than on weekends and go straight for the marketplace to get the items I need rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo collage with IKEA frames here LONG ... <p> Alas , I live in an IKEA dead zone . I remember seeing one in California a very long time ago before it had become a nationwide household name . I was tagging along with my husband on a business trip , which meant I had HOURS and HOURS to kill by myself while he was working . Dang it , I should have gone in ! The closest IKEA to us is over 10 hours away . Waaaa ! <p> Ikea is fantastic for accessories and for great fabric ! I think if you stick with their more classically designed furniture , their furniture can be timeless . I have one near so I know how to get in and out quickly , my only problem is the traffic getting there . If there is no traffic I am there in 15 min , in traffic , 45 min ! <p> I like some of the great deals you can get at IKEA , but our nearest is 12 hours away , so I only go when I visit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually avoid the upper level entirely and go straight to the goods . <p> Very mixed feelings . When I lived in London , Ikea was an hour away ( as it is for you ) and therefore , a serious , strategic outing . Now , I 'm much luckier , and I can get there in 20 minutes , which makes it easier to stop by quickly and not get totally overwhelmed . But despite frequent visits , I still make some howling Ikea mistakes . I wrote about those here : So You Think You 're an Ikea Expert ? . <p> My feelings are similar to yours I feel drawn to it and pretty much hate it once I 'm there . They do have some good finds , but I feel like Ikea is missing any kind of warmth in its stores . Your herd of cattle comment is right on point for me . That being said , I feel sad when I pass an Ikea and we cant stop . There 's something about the " hunt " once you 're there that appeals to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I love that everything there is incredibley inexpensive , but I 'm always disappointed that its such cheap quality . Its great for odds and ends and transitional/rotational pieces , but that 's where I draw the line . <p> I have a love/hate relationship with Ikea . When we lived in France , we left all of our furniture in the US so to furnish our house both stylishly and inexpensively with all the basics , I made numerous trips to Ikea on a weekly basis for months . I have an entire box full of allen keys , I knew the store like the back of my hand so I could ignore all the little blue arrows and cut through to the departments I needed . I swore I would NEVER go into another Ikea as long as I lived ! Now that were back in the States , I go about 2-3 times a year to get great deals on curtain panels and for the Lingonberry Juice ! <p> Fortunately for me , the IKEA here is a 30 minute drive away ! I have found if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I can breeze through in no time ! ! We 've found a lot of great pieces there . It especially came in handy when furnishing our daughters apartment this past summer ! ! <p> I miss IKEA . Back in the day when I was living in Amsterdam , IKEA was just a stone throw away . Now I have to travel to another state to go shopping . So far , I have not made the effort . My time off much to valueable to take a vacation for IKEA . Alas <p> My husband and i went on Sunday . I completely agree with the love/hate relationship . We promised ourselves we werent going to walk the entire storebut we ended up doing just that ! But at least we got the desks and lamps we wanted ! <p> LOVE IT . There are actually two locations within an hour of me , so I go there every couple of months or so . Our coffee table and end tables are from there , as is the desk and one of the dressers . Plus we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't  even mind walking through the labyrinth every time . Its like an adventure ! <p> Your account of IKEA is amusing . I just moved to a neighborhood that has an IKEA about 15 minutes away . I used to hate it , because I once had some bookshelves from there that fell apart quickly , and I thought the quality of everything was like that , but on my latest trip , I saw that things have much improved . I thought they had some nice looking couches , and accessories , that are mercifully reasonably priced . I 'm going to need a lot of furniture soon . I also think its great for dishware . <p> I have a love relationship with Ikea and my husband has a hate relationship with it . Lucky ours is only 10 minutes away so I go by myself or with a friend . I love the deals and I know how to navigate so I usually just go right where I need to . We find we have various friends that come from out of town though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the couple usually asks if I want to go to ikea my husband always sighs he knows well be gone half a day . <p> I wear comfy shoes and prepare for my hips to go out . Those buggies that sway any which way are very hard on me . <p> I also find as much as its fun to go , most things are not my own personal style . But you can make most things work to any given style , it just takes a little creativity . <p> And I always spend too much when going . It is what it is . <p> I have not made the trip out in quite some time . Ours is an hour away too thank goodness ! ! : ) I know a thrift is more to my own personal liking so I convince myself that everytime I get the urge to Ikea snoop again . <p> BUT they do have a wall unit I desire for my work office that ca n't be found anywhere else . So only then do I know its somewhat safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 minutes away and well needless to say we go OFTEN ! Once I learned to NOT head upstairs to the " display " area I was golden : ) Its all about the " market area " . That 's where you can find everything ! The displays and rooms are great if you need to see the furniture or get ideas , but other then that , the market place is the way to go ! Sadly , I pretty much know my ikea like the back of my hand . ha ! In fact Cason and I ran in last night to get napkins , small decorative bowls , pillow inserts , and glasses . And we were out in about 20 minutes ! I have to say that I ALWAYS get sucked into staying longer then I should though , when I do n't  have a " purpose " because I tend to just brows around ! I recently bought their large zebra print for our hallway to try and " modernize " our space a bit . I 'm LOVING it ! Paired with my discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our small hallway . Alone it looked quite stark . But with a few accessories , its quickly becoming my favorite space ! I 'm going to post on it really soon , so all can see ! As far as the pillow inserts though , I get the feather filled ones , and they are AWESOME ! And " el cheapo ! " : ) THATS why I LOVE ikea ! I 'm waiting to buy the cute scalloped white dishes when they come in next ! But they are always gone at my store : ( Ours goes through inventory REALLY quickly . <p> WOW this is a journal entry ! ha ! I love your inspiration style boards . I think that people normally get overwhelmed by the " modern " style of ikea , but they really have such great things that can work with ANYONES taste ! <p> We have our very first IKEA opening here ( Denver , CO ) in Fall 2011 ! I 've never been to one but hear so much about the great values and obviously see a lot of their pieces used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , reading these comments makes me a little nervous . So far I know to wear my sneakers , set aside half a day , and bring a snack . <p> I too have a love/hate relationship with Ikeait takes me about 2 hours to get to one , and probably 6 to go through and look at everything . I always end up with wonderful dealsjust usually forget the one thing I went forthat was on my list ! So much inspiration makes it hard to focus sometimes ! I do love that store thoughmore than the hate ! <p> Its great for when you want a specfic thing and budget in mind and lo and behold IKEA comes to your rescue ! <p> The actual trip to the store involves fully researching items of interest before we go , then listing the name and all the details . It helps the anxiety when there . Sometimes we follow the blue arrows , mostly I 'm like a hunter/gatherer and just follow my senses once I get in there grabbing what catches my eye AND then also what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away I wish they opened alot earlier too were early birds and it would be handy in missing the crowd . I will say we 've gotten damaged items ( in the box ) and begrudgingly live with it because with 2 toddlers and the hour and 1/2 round trip of driving that we JUST did , does n't  make it worth it . THAT is my biggest beef with the place ! ! <p> I grew up here in San Diego and my mom would take me with her on the annual IKEA trip that was 90 minutes away . There was no other store like it : ) Now an IKEA is here and I started taking my kids when they got older and they love it , but we rarely go . When the catalog comes out we each comb through it and there inevitably is that ONE thing we cant live without . My advice is not to take someone else there unless you know for sure they really like that store , eat first , and plan to stay all day . <p> I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest is many hours awaybut let 's keep it realI really avoid going there because I know I 'll have to remortgage my house to afford their bounty of greatness . : ) <p> So I actually worked part time at an Ikea store during college and I can tell you that you are n't  the only person to get easily confused and anxious about a trip there . I spent a good portion of my time helping people find what they were in search of and them directing them through short cuts to escape the madness . This was in between time spent organizing and restocking cookware , dinnerware and deocrative items . It was a fun experience though as they treat their employees very well . I 'm fortunate to have two Ikeas within half an hour of where I live now and still enjoy a nice wander through from time to time . Watch out for their " annual sale " though . If you hate crowds stay away . I was once berated by a customer because every shopping cart in the store was being used . Eep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but TWO Ikea stores ! TWO ! One is less than 10 minutes to the south , and the other is 20 minutes to the north . I LOVE IT ! Indy loves it too . If its raining out , or just bad weather , hell say " Mom , I think we need to go to Ikea . You need a break . " Cause its all about me . It has nothing to do with the meatballs or the play place . We go there so often , they know him by name . We know both our Ikea stores top to bottom and front to back . <p> We live 3 hours from our nearest IKEA , so my husband has learned to groan at the sight of one . I have to plot out my purchases in advance , and try to limit the showroom time , just to keep him from glaring at me ! <p> I live about 10 minutes away from an Ikea here in Connecticut , and if there is one thing I 've learned its to AVOID walking through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I need . Our Ikea has an upstairs for the display area and a downstairs for the warehouse . I found an entrance to just the warehouse , AND have learned their shortcuts to get to the checkout easier ! Also , my job as a visiting nurse allows me some time in between my patients so if I 'm having a really good day I try to go when its just opening ! I used to hate Ikea , but now I actually enjoy the trip ! <p> I havnt been to an Ikea yet ! ! = ( The closest one is about 4 1/2 hours away ( I live in Upstate NY ) , but it is on my list of things to do for 2011 . A weekend road trip w/ the husband , he just does n't  know it yet ! = ) <p> Oooh ! I LOOOOOVE Ikea ! When we were pregnant with our first child , I was extremely emotional and anxious because we had NO baby furniture , and since our families are not very " well-to-do " we did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib , a dresser , any kind of bedding ) . But thanks to Ikea , we were able to completely furnish our nursery for $180 ! Now we have two kids who share a room , and they are still sharing the original furniture we bought there . Of course , they 're not sharing a crib , we HAD to go back to Ikea and get the adorable bunk bed with a tent-cover for the top bunk , and a hang-out quiet spot below . No other bunk-bed would do as far as I was concerned . <p> I will say that going to the store with the kids is kinda a nightmare . I 've never tried putting them in the nursery because they always come out of any kind of nursery with some nasty cold virus . So we never get to casually meander down the aisles , stopping and lounging as we please . Its always , get in , get the stuff we came for , and GET OUT ! ! ! <p> 87 responses already you must being doing something right ! ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great posts . <p> As far as Ikea , same over an hour drive , my Moms beach house Ikea , our basement Ikea , and now I am in the final planning stages of redoing my 10 year old daughters bedroom and we will be heading to Ikea before the end of the month . <p> You are right though , it is a whole day excursion , but I am no sure about the meatballs , maybe I got them on a bad day ! <p> I have a love/hate relationship with Ikea . I work 2 blocks away from our local store , and while its nice to be right next door if I need anything , the thought of parking and navigating my way to the one part of the store that I need to go to is enough to make me keep driving past it , and telling myself I will go another day . The plus side is that since I am so close , I can go on a weekday when there is n't as many people . <p> LOVE Ikea ! ! Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their announcement today that they are ahead of the curve and no longer selling incandescent lightbulbs . I 'm not a fan of the look of the alternatives <p> Unfortunately I never find anything worth buying . My husband is 66 ? which means Ikea furniture is out of the picture . Everything is miniature just like pottery barn . The cheap lighting does n't  appeal to me either . Its good for small accessories once and awhile . <p> What a funny post ! I actually like going to Ikea over here in NY it is a nice boat ride ( ferry from Manhattan to Brooklyn ) to the store , and I make it a rule of mine to ONLY go during the weekdays . no crowds , can zip through the aisle in ease , and even the workers are nicer ! Plus I think I may be addicted to their $1 cinnamon buns ( yuuummmm ! ) . <p> Its complicated about sums up our sentiments too , to this Swedish maze ( we loved the cartoon ) ! One half of SisterBatik , secretly gains alot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds sinngle-handedly . <p> We are both home decor lovers and create pillows loving to fill spaces with our snuggly , ecclectic and dreamy pillows . We would love you to visit and check out what we make . <p> Ok , confession . Next week is my 30th birthday . My husband wanted to do something fun for it , so what are we doing ? Going to my very first Ikea in Salt Lake City . Its a 5.5 hour drive ( were staying for the whole weekend , do n't  worry , were skiing too ) . All for a darn Ikea . And I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I 'm so excited ! <p> I LVE IKEA ! The one by us is not too far , only about 40 minutes from one house , 20 minutes from the other . And I know the best time to go , during the week , early in the morning . By the time I am done , its usually around lunch time so I have my Ikea lunch then off somewhere else I go . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know where the shortcuts are . I know how to get help the fastest . I enjoy my trip there , knowing it could be hours of me browsing . I do n't  think Ikea is worth a brief 5 minute stay , its an experience , an event , an adventure is retailology . Everyone must do it at least once . But I do understand the frustration and anxiety . It can be overbearing . <p> Fresh &amp; Floral LOVE that pink glass vase ! Dang it . Now I have to go to Ikea ! I 'm near SLC and its just under an hour ( in good traffic ) to get my Ikea fix . I G Ikea . I always have . My bedroom growing up was all from that sweet little Swedish store , and I think 80% of my home is the same way now . In fact , when my now-husband and I were dating I said that I would be happy living in Utah as long as there was an Ikea and Disneyland . Being a Southern Californian , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got engaged after they built an Ikeaha ! <p> I love these collections you have put together , especially the first ! Those curtains would be so great in my apartment , but unfortunately my IKEA in Tampa is strangely picky about what textiles they carry : ( My biggest problem with IKEA is I tend to get overwhelmed , so its nice to see an edited collection for inspiration ! <p> I went to IKEA last weekend as well ! I wish I had run in to you , though since I 'm on the opposite coast , the odds were pretty darn slim . ( My IKEA is 90 minutes away . ) <p> I have to say that I completely agree with your assessment of the IKEA experience . I always end up feeling frustrated , overwhelmed , covetous , hungry , bovine ( herded like cattle ! ) , anxious , and excited . <p> I loved all the funky white light fixtures and those drapes you showcased in mood board #1 above . And I brought a Knubbig table lamp home with me . Alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip ( White Lack shelving a la John &amp; Sherry of //www.younghouselove.com ) was OUT OF STOCK I did n't  know that ever happened there . My boyfriend encountered the same problem with the cabinet lights he wanted . Alas , this means we must return in a few weekswhich will conveniently be right around my birthday . Yee-hah ! <p> I totally dig IKEA . I 'd never been to one before until a couple years ago when they built one near my house . Seriously near . Several miles away , but we can get there in a couple minutes . The girls and I go every month or so . In fact , were headed there tomorrow for free lunch for the kiddos : ) I enjoyed your product groupings ! Great inspiration : ) <p> I had my maiden voyage to an IKEA just after we moved to Minneapolis this fall ! We reside just 20-30 minutes away from the Mall of America and Ikea is planted ever so conveniently just across the street . I could even take the light rail there from our down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hearding method as well but with all the eye candy to obsorb they won me over . ; ) <p> I L-O-V-E Ikea . The closest one is almost 2 hours away , so like you , I have to plan an entire day for the outing . And I do n't  mind one bit . There is something about those arrows that botherates me , but I fight back by wandering around aimlessly , completely at random . That explains why I put the same thing in my basket 3 times , hmmm . Oh well , Ikea and I are a match made in heaven . They make great stuff for those of us with tiny houses , and I cant get enough of those swedish meatballs , and the loganberry fizzy drinks ! <p> I have to start off by saying , one of my readers sent me this article . I had blogged about my Office/Playroom makeover and my lack of curtains . She suggested Ikea and it sounds like my kind of store . <p> I 've checked it out online and I 'm making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to find an Ikea store and shop my little heart out . I may never leave . Ever . <p> I totally agree . Ours is only 30 minutes away , but couple Ikea with its next door neighbor , Lowes , and the time commitment is more than I can handle usually . After envisioning the trip for months , I usually end up buying one measly little thing . I guess I am just not a shopper . But it is fun in there ! <p> I really like Ikea , but have to be careful there . Some things are made very well , others not so much . I 've had not great luck with things like put-together desks and things made mostly of particle board . On the other hand , we had a Klippan loveseat that outlived our Jennifer Sofa and Wickes sofa by years . I love their textiles and curtains too . Frames and floor lampsWell , I 've had some fall apart too easily . Maybe I 'm rough . Or , maybe I am spoiled . I have an Ikea right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new reader ( as of yesterday , thanks to Jen at iheartorganizing ! ) but I have to say I was instantly addicted for many reasons : your love of spray paint , your style , and ideas , and your name ( I 've always loved Kate ! ) . You make me lol ! = ) I 'm headed to Ikea this weekend and my first trip to Home Goods as well ! = ) I think shopping online and knowing what you want always helps at ikea .. though the cattle hearding method does confuse me . What to do when you want to wander away from the safety of the blue arrows ? <p> IKEA is just too darn cheap and convenient for me to avoid . I love it despite the fact that many frown upon it . I find it a personal challenge to find things there that do n't  look too " IKEA . " Admittedly , I look forward to every trip there , and I have been fortunate enough to have 1 or 2 IKEAs in each of the two cities Ive lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 times a year or more ) begins with a $1 vanilla cone and ends with me excited to go home to assemble my new furniture ! <p> I have a love/hate relationship with IKEA . I love many of their items , but I hate when I drive out there ( after checking the website ) to find that what I was going for in not in stock I also hate going on weekends . Have you ever been on the weekends ? GIrl , a mess ! Especially when you have kids with you . <p> Love/hate here as well . I lack the creativity to use their simple items uh , creatively . I have to be careful my house does n't  start turning into a college dorm/Ikea store . But its made for some good date nights- when I was closing on my house , my bf and I would stroll around looking at kitchen remodel ideas , then skip the cafeteria but load up on six cinnamon rolls . Sounds like a date to me ! <p> Not a fan . I 've not been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture " . I live within 20 minutes of a massive IKEA . Its been here about 20 years . Ive been in it maybe twice and cant even remember the last time I stepped foot through the doors except for the fact I had a panic attack because I got lost and could n't find my way out . The end . : ) <p> I go to IKEA about 4-5 times a year , perhaps more . Its on the outskirts of my city ( Edmonton , AB , CANADA ) but at least its in the same city that I live in , unlike a lot of people who commute to shop there . I go there often enough that I know the floor plan and where all the sly hidden doors are that skip the " herding " method . But , the first time I went , I was disgusted by it . <p> I also go in backwards . I go past the checkout right to the As Is section and browse there first , then I go to the actually shopping area . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bat , instead of finding out what I love is in the As Is section after picking it out . Plus , the As Is is my favorite area in every furniture store . <p> My main gripe with IKEA ( other then the herding feeling ) is that their couches and chairs are too small/low . I know this is done because less material is used to make them that way but I am a 6 foot tall woman . I feel like I am sitting on kiddie furniture when I try out their couches . My goal is to find items I can make my own and that not every other friend is going to have in their house . <p> I LOVE Ikea ! ! ! And now so does my hubby . He s never been &amp; he thought going to the nearest IKEA , a 2 hour drive , on New Years Eve Day was just the thing . He was overwhelmed at first , but is not looking for excuses to make a trip back there sooner rather than later . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit for a whole lotta trinkets , towel bars , rugs , candles , and on &amp; on <p> I love Ikea , I would always make my husband take me when we visited So . Cal . And then we moved to Denver , even further ( we lived in Vegas ) , until they announced that they would be building an Ikea here , YAY , opening this fall , cant wait ! <p> My daughter just said TODAY that I should do a post like this about IKEA . The above floral pillows ( and striped yellow duvets ) and wicker hanging lights are in a bedroom in our ski condo . When we lived in Paris our little kitchen was all from IKEA . We had open stainless steel shelves above the counter that I loved . Some stuff is cheap ( and wears that way ) but what style . I say " LOVE . " I kind of like getting lost there . Mary Ann <p> Oh my- this is hilarious ! I feel the exact . same . way ! Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half away , and inevitably I do n't  have enough space in my vehicle to buy everything that I want : ( I drive a VAN for crying out loud , and I still do n't  have the space ! <p> I have to travel a long way to get to Ikea . My first trip was in Chicago and the store was newneed I say more ? The parking alone made me crazy . I have also been to the one in Orlando , and I do find a few things but I 'm much more of a Crate and Barrel girl . I get crazy at Ikea ! <p> Beautiful designs ! Ours is about an hours drive and yes , its a maze . I love spending hours there though . Its like walking through a giant beautiful dollhouse ! LOVE ! However , I rarely walk out with much . I think its the " pretty-overload " and my fear of spending $$$ . <p> I love IKEA . My friends and I always joke about someone who could still be lost in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need . <p> I just moved to Chicago and our apartment has tons of huge windows . Since we will eventually buy a house again , I did n't  want to invest tons on window dressings . So off to IKEA I went and for under $100. bought enough curtain panels for the whole house . <p> omg I 've had a hankering to go to Ikea too ! And you totally ( and hysterically ) hit the nail on the head ! it really is a rush of many many emotions ! Hopefully in the end , though , its happy . Especially when you get the goodies up and running ! I make it a point to stop and get a cinnabun . If I do n't  , I do n't  leave truly happy . HA ! <p> there and after a full night of " unswallowing " as my aunt used to call it I had to make the trek back to Vegas ( both girls had been better for a full day ) . Anyway , I must really love Ikea because I drove 30minutes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before embarking on the 6 hour trip home . My mother-in-law thought I was crazy but she has the luxury of going to this Mecca anytime she wants ! Mo <p> I also have a Love/Hate relationship with Ikea , for many of the reason you stated above , but also for the fact that they do not ship anything ! I know , I know , I 've heard it allthats how they keep their cost down , but I live 3.5 hours from the closest Ikea , and since its pretty close to D.C. it typically takes me over 5 hours to get back home with all the traffic ! So that 's an eight hour or so car ride , let alone the time you spend in the store . So maybe if they started offering shipping for more of their items it would be a love/like relationship ! <p> Love their products , but do n't  love that I leave with a headache due to the overstimulation/ excitement I get when I 'm shopping ! ( : Also- ca n't beat their prices . I 'm really liking the Fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so perfectly . I love IKEA . I had my first and only experience this year when I went to visit my son . We have no IKEA close where I live and Ive always wanted to check one out . I noticed right away that I felt like I was in some kind of maze , with the arrows leading us about , but my mind was so taken in buy all the incredible displays and smells . Of course , we too had to get some of the meatballs to fuel us up for the several hour shopping experience that awaited us. i absolutely loved it . I want to go back so badly . I got some of the embroidered pillows and have about 100 things on my wish list . <p> I , sadly , have never stepped foot into their store . The closest one is over 6 hours away ! I 'm now thinking the drive might be worth it . You had me at " professional daycare that greets you at the door " . <p> I 'm Swedish so I grew up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid no one would dare to go in the store because it was considered really cheap and bad quality . But somewhere along the way they changed their tune and became hip and cool . I personally love IKEA but HATE to go there . I get stressed the second I arrive , ditch my plan , head for the meatballs and buy things I do n't  need on my way out . <p> Ikea , *sigh* , the closest one to me is about a 2 hour drive , if traffic is good so its an all day trip for me . I usually find a girl friend to go with me and make a girls day out of it including a stroll in the mall next door if we have time . The market place gets me every time , I can go intending to only get a few items and walk out with enough to fill my van . <p> We are lucky to have two IKEAS by us , both within about a half an hour . . . so I like to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spend about an hour there and then I 'm done . I usuallly know just what I 'm looking for , but I always buy waaaay more than what I intended to . I , too , love their Swedish meatballs since I am 100% Swedish . Curtains are my favorite thing to buy there . The Matilda curtains are my very favorite . <p> When we first moved to DC I was at Ikea weekly . It lost its allure and everything started to look so ho-hum . Now I go semi annually and am in love again . We bought a Knapp pendant to hang in one of our little bed rooms recently . <p> Were furnishing a new home and I 'm worried its going to look like an ikea showroom if I keep shopping there . I think most people have a love/hate relationship with that place . I do n't  want to buy any big pieces there because all my friends have them . <p> I am like you . Its a love relationship . : ) I have a Christmas IKEA gift card from a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taking the hour drive to the store Saturday ! Yay ! . just wish I could spend more money right now : D ( LoL my husband thinks I can be like the lady in the IKEA commercial that shows up to the house in a semi with stuff on sale , and then runs back for more . No , I am NOT like that . Really , I do actually exert self control : ) My list is for kitchen stuff on Saturday , since its practical right now . Even though I long for a Varde shelf , pretty drinking glasses , pretty table wear , other bookshelves , one day-a nice kitchen , a few curtains , rugs , vase , lamps : ) <p> I am fortunate to have an Ikea store about 10 minutes away so I pop in when it is not busy , i.e. mid morning . I definitely try to avoid the place on a weekend or right before all the dorm room shoppers storm the place in August . I often go to browse when I am looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conference table , bookshelves of different sizes and a lobby desk all from Ikea . Saved lots of money until it came time to pay our handyman to put it all together ! But it looks great without a huge investment . Love to know how you did those color boardsfrom olioboard , polyvore ? <p> I really like Ikea , but I also do extreme planning for my trips . I get there at opening with a list in hand of what I want . I practically run to the products and then book it to the check-out stands . In and out in under an hour . Bam ! <p> I love Ikea ! My husband is from Atlanta , so whenever we visit his family we make a trip . A lot of our bedroom is from there , since were obsessed with the Hemnes collection . And I do n't  mind putting the pieces together since were getting such a great deal with prices . Its funny- we have the curtains you posted in the natural spread in our bathroom , and those pillows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! when my daughter and my friends 2 girls were little we took them there for the day like other kids got to go to the amuesment parks ! hot dogs swedish meatballs ice cream cones they never knew the diffrence ! ! ! <p> I used to go once a week when I lived 5 minutes from one . It gave me all sorts of ideas plus got me a little exercise.once you 're in you might as well walk the whole store . I swear half of our old house was Ikea . <p> I have n't been to Ikea in 1.5 years and I 'm starting to go thru withdrawals . After seeing your photos of curtains , etc. , I may have a venture back there . Its so wonderful . <p> oh good heavens , my Ikea is less than a fifteen minute ride by i95 ! I have been debating , do I *really* need to go and waste money I should n't spend ? Hmmm. on the one hand , I save money by staying home . On the other , I miss touching the fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picture frames , and oh yeah the swedish meatballs ! ( I love them too ! ) <p> I may see a trip there in the next week or so , I know my kids are dying to go spend some cash too ! <p> I have to say I am not a big fan . There is one very close to me although with San Fran bay area traffic , it feels like it could be on the other side of the country ! Too many things there feel a tad cheap . <p> I think that far better furniture can be found in antique and thrift stores at better prices , but I love the hunt for that perfect piece at a bargain more than actually owning the piece ! However , I have an Ikea drafting table ( with integrated light table ) which I love for my art projects , and I recently redid my nephews bedroom using a clearance find Ikea bunk bed system which is really sturdy . <p> I also like their printed textiles but havent found a use for them yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they blend colors and textures ( ok , and the swedish meatballs ) . <p> I 've never been to an IKEA and feel very left out . The good news is were finally getting a store here in Denver this Fall and its about 10 minutes from me ! Very excited . I did n't  read through all of the comments but scanned them and noticed many of your readers really like IKEA as you do . I 've heard mixed reviews , the negatives mostly about their furniture not being high quality and difficult to assemble . I would love to know what you and your readers thoughts are on the quality of their furniture ? Ive been drooling over the cubed shelving unit and hope it will be worth purchasing . Thanks and I love your blog ! <p> I have mixed feelings about IKEA . One part of me loves to go through the " maze " and see all the model rooms that are set up . The prices are great and you can furnish a whole house for a great price , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all very " IKEA-y . " We were shopping pretty frequently at IKEA for furniture for our new home until I did some more research and found that many stores were selling better quality pieces at ( almost ) IKEA prices if you used their promo codes and waited for online and in-store sales . Right now my favorite online shopping resources are Wisteria and Williams Sonoma Home . Both had great sales that brought their steep furniture prices down to ( almost ) IKEA prices . <p> I have no stamina for shopping so Ikea is a true test . I am an Ikea convert and will search for items I have seen in magazines/blogs that have been mixed with high end pieces . Check out You Tube for Ikea -Parody to Owl City Fireflies by davedays I hum this as I wander about and find it calms me and keeps me focussed . <p> The only IKEA store in my area is a good 40 minute drive away , thank goodness . Coincidentally , my niece called and asked me to go with her yesterday , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization supplies , her for home schooling , me for my studio , so we did n't  do a lot of dawdling in other departments . <p> I do n't  like the labyrinth I resent being deliberately manipulated . We kept looking for the shortcuts to get where we wanted to go . So I guess I have a love/hate thing going . <p> I Love Ikea . Mostly for their storage options . ohI love their fabric too ! Their furniture is fun but I have a hard time getting my husband to like any of it . He thinks its " cheap crap " . : ) So , when I go once every few months I stock up on my favorite straws , napkins and add any other little home accessories I need or want , actually , more like what I can afford at the moment . : ) That image is so true though . They plan it that way on purpose I am sure . Just to get you hungry and tired and want to take a break that will give you more energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Got married &amp; moved into our apt a month and a half a go . Our IKEA is about 30 mins away but I was able to go and gather up all that I needed in two separate 2-hour trips . Got some larger items like a TV stand and two end tables ( the dark wood in the photos ) , organization boxes , pillow inserts and covers ( including the polka dot in the photo ) , and random stuff like large cereal bowls a potato masher ! <p> I actually work across the street from Ikea and have finally figured out the floorplan . I run over there on my lunch breakstop in like its Target . But I would n't be caught dead there on a weekend ! ! ! ! <p> We drove SIX hours one way to go to IKEA the weekend after Thanksgiving ( I know , were nuts ) , shopped ( and dined on meatballs ) for five hours , then turned around and drove the six hours home .. all in one day . Like I said , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IKEA experience made me LOL cause it was so dead-on . Love ! <p> Ikea and I too have a love/hate relationship but not for the same reasons . I love the style of their items but the nearest location is 6 hours from my house . And they do n't  ship hardly anything ! It drives me nuts how they are promoted everywhere-books , magazines , tv , blogs but I cant get to any of the stuff ! <p> I love IKEA . My husband and I usually spend the better part of a day there which includes lunch ( had the Swedish meatballs for the first time last visit-yummy ) I usually buy items or furniture that will go with my revamped bits and pieces . I love the walk through the store as it gives me great ideas for my home . <p> I am pretty obsessed with IKEA . You cant beat the prices and here in the Netherlands they have them all over . The only problem is it is so common here that you see the same piece in every house ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they can stand out ! <p> I both like and dislike Ikea . Some good deals to be had on some decent things . Need storage containers ? Ikeas great . Need furniture ? Their quality is terrible . Its not just inexpensive , its cheap . And it looks cheap . I think its the ideal place for a college student or young apartment dweller to shop . <p> But I LOVE their design and smart storage solutions . I love how they can maximize space with creative ideas . Its a great place to learn about design and storage and plan your space . But if you want good quality furniture that wo n't fall apart in a few years and end up in a landfill and requiring you to replace it , you wo n't find it there . <p> I adore IKEA on the one hand , but on the other , yeah , same things as you : hate the parking lots , the labyrinth , and the fact that I can never get out of there without spending hundreds of dollars ! Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been known to " overbuy " before , once I had to strap a rather large wall unit to the top of my little car and hope for the best driving home ! <p> IKEA to me means " disposable furniture " I do n't  think their quality is that good on many of their items , but the accessories are neat and of good quality for the most part , and one can get some necessity items for not a lot of money . <p> We live 15 minutes from an Ikea so I go about once a month . I think every other trip is a longer one , but I 've definitely been able to go in and out in 30 minutes before , especially if its a weekday . Unfortunately the last time I went ( the 30th of Dec ) I had plans to return a Christmas gift idea that we did n't  end up needing and pick up two things . Well I was able to get the two things ( and a third item I found ) in only 15 minutes including check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toy though ! <p> I find my love/hate is because I love so many things at Ikea and the prices but I hate that people can immediately tell that something is from Ikea when they come into our home ! <p> I really love ikea ! i 'm always working on a pretty tight budget , so its a Godsend for me ! ; ) The nearest one is about 45 minutes away , but its not too bad ! ive only actually been once , but am planning to go back in the next few weeks . My favourite purchase was definitely the KARIT deep purple throw and pillows . It was a bit pricey at G50 , but its been on my bed ever since , and is really good quality , really heavy and luxurious , it adds a touch of class to my room ! Also , I made sure to pick up at least 5 pillow inserts . ive been on a pillow-case making kick lately , so they came in handy , and at only 99cents each ? ! I 'm there ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you posted in neutrals , were planning on buying that one in the multi-color to go with our new couch . Just took a trip to Ikea on Saturday with a friend . Love their food sometimes , other times , not so much . <p> I have to say that although the design of the store is like a giant maze that keps you trapped forever , I LOVE Ikea ! This store allows you to decorate using some very pretty things on a budget . I purchased a desk from Ikea for 79 dollars and it was solid . I mean it was quality . I eventually gave the desk away . So , if you 're on a budget and you have the time , then check this store out if you have n't already . <p> My first visit to an Ikea store was in Sweden in 1983 while visiting family in Valbo . Did n't  get to experience the thrill of it again until I moved to VA and went to the Woodbridge store near DC in the early 90s . Now my girls are grown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion from Richmond just to go to Ikea . I also have family in Atlanta and no visit is complete without a trip to Ikea with family and friends . Taking ( my born and raised in Sweden ) mom is fun because shell translate the names of some of the items AND now they have a series with my name on it .. how cool is that ? ! <p> Love the " hol side table " ca n't find it on the website- could it be listed under another name ? Love ikea , definitely a love/hate relationship . I like to go with something in mind , otherwise the store can be overwhelming . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057782 @3257782/ <h> The Joy of Popcorn Ceiling Removal <p> By Kate Riley July 7 , 2014 <p> It 's always necessary to do the ugly , messy work before you can get to the pretty . We hate it , but we know it 's true . Before you can add the furnishings and window treatments and pillows and accents you 've got to establish a clean foundation to build upon and doing so is never ever as fun as styling and arranging , but it must be done . <p> Enter the battle with sprayed acoustic texture otherwise known as the dreaded popcorn ceiling from the 70s and 80s . It 's everywhere in the house we bought and it must be removed . The process is messy if you do it yourself , somewhat costly if you do n't , but necessary for me in a modern home and one that adds value if you ask my broker/appraiser husband . <p> We started the process in a bedroom , one that possesses the chicest combination : old tan carpet , yellowed outlet covers , peach metal mini blinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , it 's just so hard to part with it all . <p> This bedroom was a great place to start for one has not had the pleasure , joy , thrill , delight , excitement , and satisfaction of scraping a popcorn ceiling . <p> A fact you must know : prior to 1979 , popcorn ceilings contained asbestos but it was banned in 1978 so if you have/own/purchase a home from that era grab a test kit at your local home improvement store to diagnose yours . If your popcorn ceiling contains asbestos , leave this job to a professional lest you want to be poisoned . I do n't think you do . <p> However if your home was built in the late 80s as this one was ( 1989 ) you should be safe . I 'm here to tell you the process is cheap and simple , albeit extremely messy . <p> I did a lot of The Reading Of The Tutorials online before I went shopping at Home Depot . Many of them said much of the same thing which gave me great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . I felt equipped and prepared for the job ahead . It began like so . <p> First , remove any ceiling light fixtures , and make sure wires are capped with wire nuts . I 'm replacing this fan with a more contemporary one later this month , this is the desert , so ceiling fans are welcome here . Also remove vent cover . <p> Next , tape off any area you do n't want to get hit with moisture because you 're about to go crazy with a garden hose inside your house . Note that tape is n't going to hold for long , my plastic sheeting + painter 's tape combo eventually came down and settled on the floor but cautious spraying does prolong its life . <p> Next enlist husband/DIY partner with pumped up gung-ho zest for project to spray the ceiling with the garden hose and mister nozzle . <p> - <p> This can be a one person project after 15 minutes Matt left to work on other things and I tackled the remainder of the ceiling myself mist then scrape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , misting two times , waiting 10 minutes , misting three times waiting 15 minutes etc. but mostly it requires misting an area a few times several minutes apart then scraping the texture off the ceiling . Look at this experience as a substitute for going to the gym , it involves a great arm workout plus a little leg work climbing up and down a ladder . <p> We tried a metal scraping tool but that seemed to do more damage to the underlying sheetrock so we used the plastic versions and they worked just fine . <p> Be sure to wear those goggles and a respirator safety first friends . <p> Expect a pool of tasty goodness to collect below on the floor . <p> I used the edge of the plastic tool to slice away the popcorn texture where it met the wall . <p> You may encounter issues on the ceiling once you 've scraped , peeling paper , random imperfections but that 's nothing a little joint compound ca n't fix . Use the same plastic tool to apply it , wait for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedge . <p> Blurry pic but whatev . One can not be expected to photograph perfectly with the left hand when one is right handed . Universal truth . <p> Here is the ceiling all scraped , patched , sanded and ready for primer plus paint . Add a new fan above and new flooring below and then the pretty can begin . <p> I hate that air conditioning vent in the middle of the ceiling with a passion . I have to investigate the complicatedness of moving a smaller vent closer to the closet and away from the light fixture . <p> I did n't take the final shot at the end of me covered in the popcorn goo but just imagine all of this coating every part of your hair , clothing , and body . Matt swears I 've never looked lovelier . <p> It was n't as difficult as I thought it might be . Messy ? Yes , totally expect that . But if you fancy being coated in moist white texture and love the idea of a popcorn free flat ceiling I recommend this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discard , and forget it was ever there . <p> Total time to remove the popcorn ceiling in this 12 x 13 ' bedroom including misting , scraping , compounding , and sanding was about 2 -+ hours not including the primer/paint necessary that remains so add another 45 minutes for the total project . <p> In other unrelated news , the reconstruction of the pool begins next week in our absence which we 're excited about because right now in the Ugly And Unsafe contest this pool is miles ahead . Also Gross if that 's a category . <p> We 're tackling this pool renovation in two phases , part one is removal of this broken crumbling glass block wall that separates the pool from the spa . We 're having our contractor create a thicker wall between the two with plaster and tile and then give it an acid wash and chlorine bath so when we return in two weeks we can at least cool off in the pool between projects without worry of losing a limb . <p> Part Two will be replacing all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment ) , but the new tile installation wo n't happen until fall , we decided it makes more sense to pretty it up in the off season . <p> Will this work with hideous flower patterns on the ceiling too ? Who designed such a thing ? ? ? I cant wait to see what your project house will look like when you finish , nut for now I wish you lots of strength ! ! <p> We just bought our first home , and every room in the 2000 sqft has popcorn ceilings . I just tackled the first room and it did not go as smoothly for me , but it was a learning experience and has me ready to do the rest of the house ( but room by room , over the course of a few years ) . : ) it is completely worth it ! <p> When we did this at my moms house , we just used a hand-held spray bottle and let it soak the ceiling before scraping a section at a time . That way we did n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It worked great ! <p> We did this in our family room/kitchen . Worst day of my life . It was much harder to remove than yours seemed to be . So hard to get off , no matter what how much moistuire we put on it . Took ALL day and was the biggest mess I ever experienced . Then we hired someone to smooth out the ceiling because it was a mess underneath . However , it was worth it in the end . We now have a smooth , normal ceiling in one room of our house . We decided we would live with the popcorn in the rest of the house before we would go through that again ! I 'm happy for those whose popcorn is easier to remove than ours was . I will never buy another house with these kind of ceilings <p> I recall seeing a tool at Lowes that was designed to be used for this . It had a bag attached to catch the stuff that dropped off the ceiling as you 're scraping . I did n't  try it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a try . <p> Wow Peggy , havent seen those ! I 'll keep an eye out for future ceilings , we have many more to do ! Michelle , ours were painted too , it made the popcorn thicker but not more difficult to remove . Becky , we plan to hire out the high ceilings in the living room , dining room and master I can only handle this a few more times ( remaining bedrooms and family room ) on the low ceilings . Ugh , such a mess ! <p> We did this in all of the rooms in our house . It IS a pain and a HUGE mess to tackle but SOOOO worth it when its done . Youll love being able to look at pretty , smooth ceilings for ever after . I used a large spray bottle to mist water onto the ceiling , let it sit for a few minutes and then scraped with a plastic putty knife . I was able to hold the knife almost flat against the ceiling to scrape and that seemed to help avoid the accidental gouges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are afraid of the water ruining them a spray bottle works great . ( Less water than a hose ) Just be sure to put the plastic sheeting on the floor to cover and then go to town on that popcorn ! <p> I remember my Brother in Law doing this . He kind of MacGuyver ed the thing . He used a long hose to the wet vax and taped ( ? ) the scraper tool to it ? I remember he got most of the gunk in the wet vac . <p> Married to a drywall contractor for 30 years and he has done this process over and over . Watching him take down our popcorn ceiling was fascinating as he was so efficient and quick ( and he was n't covered in yucky popcorn ! ) Thought I 'd share his techniques as he would never use a garden hose to saturate the drywall use a new bug sprayer to squirt the water in very specific areas on the ceiling . And layer your contractor plastic in squares on the floor . Spray a corner ( about 5+5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mud knife onto a layered plastic square . Pick up the square with damp popcorn on it , tie it up and place in corner ( or another area ) . This keeps his bakers rack and/or ladder clean and keeps one from stepping in the popcorn gunk on the floor ! <p> If your pop corn ceilings were painted , they will be harder to remove , than the standard issue non painted white ones . My 2 sons and I did about 1500 square feet easily , in a few hours . A pump type garden sprayer would be less messy than a hose . If you scrape with one hand and " catch " with the other holding a plastic garbage can lid , you can easily dump it into the garbage can , lined with a contractor bag . MUCH LESS MESS ! ! ! ! ! It is quite an arm work-out though ! <p> We inherited a house , pre-78 , custom-built , complete with popular asbestos popcorn ceilings . So , we paid the several thousands for the abatement . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was soooooo worth it ! The new texture is subtle and we had a white latex semi-gloss painted over it light and refreshing . Our neighbors &amp; guests have all raved over our ceilings , wanting the numbers of both our designers and contractors . I admit the asbestos thing freaked me out when the test results came back . But the most difficult part of the process was interviewing the abatement contractors and getting referrals . Also , we lucked out in that we did n't  have to move out before the abatement could start ! <p> If your ceiling is pre 78 or if the mess is just overwhelming , you can drywall right over the popcorn . This is an especially good idea if you have vaulted or very high ceilings , or if your ceiling has been painted . <p> Lots of good tips on here . I 've finally finished ridding my whole house of popcorn ceilings earlier this year ! I used a pesticide sprayer ( that I bought new and only used for water ) . I would scrape the peaks off dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too much water and the paper on the drywall peels but just enough and the popcorn scrapes off like butter . The bag/scraper combo did not work for me ( the bag gets too heavy for your arms and the tool fast ) ; its going to be messy no matter how you do it ! <p> That . is. gross . One of those DIY jobs that is dirty and messy and no one will notice once the ceilings are done and freshly painted . No one will notice but you , who will be very happy that you removed that popcorn and created a nice smooth finish . <p> My husbands previous house had popcorn ceilings which took me back to my parents building a house in the 70sI have no idea " why " but at the time a textured ceiling was so cool . As a special touch , my bedroom had gold glitter along with popcorn . As said , so cool . <p> When I painted our popcorn ceilings , I rolled back and forth over the same spot too many times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wonder if you could use a thick napped roller to apply the water . <p> I think the popcorn was once an upgrade for accoustics , especially with cathedral ceilings . That and carpeting . Very different now with clattery hardwood . We had ours removed and were surprised how much light was added to the room . Popcorn ceilings suck the light out of the room with their texture . There is a shadow created on one side of the bump . <p> Great job ! Just want to qualifyyour house was most likely safe since it was built so late , but even though asbestos in the ceiling was outlawed in 1979 , the stock already manufactured could be used until it ran out , so anything to the mid-80s could have it . <p> Unfortunately , my dads house probably has it in the addition built in 1964 , but until I 'm ready to remove it , I 'm not testing it ! <p> I am sure during this process you have read any tutorials and every solutions to problems like this one and I trust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am concern about spraying an interior ceiling that was n't made to receive any water , plus on gypse who is n't waterproof like in a bathroom . I would use a smaller sprayer tool ( like those little bottles with a thin spray at the end instead of a gardening hose . I am sure your ceiling is dry now but that would be a big concern for me . I would n't want any molding issues because of that kind of projects who are made to make the house better ; - ) <p> Kate , I always enjoy your posts but this one made me laugh out loud : ) Thanks for making this grungy process sound entertaining and fun- makes me think that I could handle this project at our next house ! <p> Hi Kate ! Just a word of warning for you when , in case you werent informed of this yet . When you acid wash your pool , it is extremely important to brush the sides EVERYDAY after the acid washing is complete . There are tiny holes in the plaster , ( much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by water deposits that will be removed when acid washed . This will make the plaster much more susceptible to stain ! So until the little ( very little ) holes are filled with water deposits again , dirt will accumulate in them and stain your pool ! I learned first hand . The peeps that acid washed the pool at my last house did n't  tell me this . It stained terribly . At the house we are in now , we faithfully brushed the sides a couple times a day until it cured.maybe for the first week to 2 weeks . Hope this helps . <p> I tackled this on my own not knowing of a way , other then just start scraping . I did n't  use any water at all , I held a cookie sheet in one hand and a scraper in the other , and it went fine , It may not be perfectly flatly smooth but I think it looks great , and planned to do it in the other rooms as well . I think when I tear up the old carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was painted over it looks great , NO water involved . I was amazed at how fast it went I had the bedroom done in less then a hour . My house was built around 1995 . <p> For 24 years we lived in a " 50s " rambler with FLAT ceilings and LOVED it . I like color on my ceilings in many areas , not white . THEN we built a new house with popcorn and vaults ( did n't  think of asking for plain sheetrock . Hated it . Bought a new , pre-built a few years later , with popcorn and vaults . Still hate it . But were just too " beyond " the climbing and scraping point . Guess I 'll have to price it out or learn to ignore it . Ick ! This is a really helpful and informative article . Thanks . <p> I know I 'm the minority here but I sort of like popcorn ceilings . I lived in a place for a few years that had them and I sort of kinda almost miss them . I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks more like cottage cheese . Haha ! One day it will be all the rage again and everyone will be hating their smooth ceilings and paying to have them " repopped " . = ) <p> Donna is right ! We have cathedral ceilings and the people who built it paid extra to have the popcorn applied ( and did n't  pay to have it applied to the closets , LOL ) . We just had ours removed this year and have SMOOTH ceilings with no tacky texture of any kind . Soooo excited . My dh and I did remove the popcorn in a small bathroom on our own ; we decided we were NOT interested in doing the whole house and paid someone . Best money we ever spent ! <p> You said that right KJ . There are hardly any bloggers giving an explanation of what they do with the pool . I tried removing popcorn ceiling at my house some days back but did not know what to do with the pool . Now I will get to know that ! ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057784 @3257784/ <h> Bathroom +tagFre <p> By Kate Riley August 27 , 2012 <p> One of these days , I have to get Matt to sit down to type his love/hate letter to IKEA. - Just to get it off his chest . <p> Like me , he loves the cost savings but many times I 've asked him if he would make the round trip to IKEA for me and then it ends badly. - One time he gauged his cheek on a shelf corner in the the loading zone and he had to wear a bandage on his face for a week. - ( I heard about that episode more than once. ) - Another time he ran out of gas on the way home late at night which was my fault because he took my car and I forgot to tell him the tank was on empty. - Oops . <p> Still , he 's kind enough to make a trip for me a few times a year as long as I locate online the exact Aisle and the exact Bin number for retrieval and purchase of specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maze . <p> When I chose the Vittsjos for the shelving in the study last month , I asked him to grab one extra skinny one just in case the two big ones side by side were too long. - They were n't , and it all worked out perfectly , but I was left with a single $40 Vittsjo shelf that sat in the garage for a month. - I almost returned it. - I almost donated it. - Then I realized I had some wasted vertical space in our master bathroom , and I was in need of a storage solution , so why not put it to good use there . <p> I wish I had figured this out months ago , since we only had a short metal table in there holding towels. - This inexpensive solution is so much nicer , and allows for space for washcloths , hand towels , and toiletries too . <p> - . <p> All it took was a can of spray paint and an afternoon to convert the black metal shelves to silver ones once it was assembled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , there might not be enough room to access the vanity nearby , but I can still grab my hairdryer , flattening iron , etc. even if the drawers do n't pull out all the way. - Bonus the scale is disguised better now , and since it has n't been telling me what I want lately , I 'm happy it is mostly out of view. - : ) <p> I found a chrome wine rack on clearance at Pier One I thought it would be perfect for holding hand towels ! <p> With a pocket door entry to our master bathroom , there 's no concern about the door blocking it so this new shelf fits the space nicely . <p> It 's really nice having all those daily essentials in glass containers rather than searching through drawers every morning . <p> The spray paint finish looks more like brushed nickel than shiny chrome , but I prefer it that way. - It thought about adding a layer of silver leaf for texture , but decided the smooth finish was enough as is. <h> 80 comments <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post on them I went to the ikea website and searched around . I now want one of those shelves ! If you do not want the clear glass the krylon Looking Glass Mirror paint would work so well with those ! <p> Kate I love it ! ! ! I was trying to figure out what was holding the hand towelsgenius ! ! ! I would have never guessed a wine rack . I 'm really starting to love these shelves . I 've always been a more chucky shelf or bookcase kind of girl . Thanks for sharing ! ! ! : ) <p> Nice job . Since following your blog , I 've learned the magic that is within a can of paint and cant wait to take on something else . I 'm always looking beyond the color of something now if I think its something that can be painted to match my taste . <p> Thank you for the inspiration ! I have this blank area in my half bath that I 've been trying to figure out how to fill . Never dawned on me until now that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will be making the trek to IKEA this weekend ! Thanks ! <p> Beautiful ! I 'm so bummed : inspired by your earlier Vittsjo postings I decided an Ikea hack of the bookshelf would be perfect for my office . Made the 4 hour drive from Tulsa to Dallas this weekend to pick up the shelf and . . . it was out of stock . I had even checked the stock level online before leaving . Phooey . This gave me a chance to see your silver paint job though . I had been trying to decide between silver &amp; turquoise for the hack and beautiful though it is , the turquoise will work better for me . Thanks for your amazing Ikea hack posts ! <p> Love the way it turned out ! And , my husband HATES going to IKEA ! We went recently and luckily for him just bought small things that I put together easily myself . He just dislikes the maze of it all , so like you I tried to find everything online first , although we were left wandering the place with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent where I expected them to be . Good times . : ) <p> Our nearest IKEA is 8 hours in any direction , but next month were going up to Denver and those shelving units are on my list of wants ! I want a brass and glass shelf for our retro living room . I 'm going to spray paint them to make em brassy . I 'm so excited ! : ) <p> I 'm headed to IKEA this weekend ! Love all you did . That looks amazing ! I was wondering if taking the undersink cabinet door off and putting baskets in the pull outs would increase your accessibility to your hairdryer and flat iron ? <p> It looks great . I saw on Pinterest where someone had stored all their q tips , cotton balls etc in old silver cream and sugars . I think I am going to try that . I am always tempted to buy them at the thrift store . Your projects always look so clean and classy . <p> Beautifully done as usual . I love all the little touches . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't  open all the way you could unscrew the hinges and attach the door to the bottom pull out drawer with screws from the inside . That way the door would pull out with the drawers and allow better access . I do n't  know maybe not , just a thought . ; ) Love your style Kate I can always tell one of your rooms when I see the photo . Always soft , calm with a little glam . <p> that skinny shelf is perfect , right ? ? I have the exact one in my bath too ! Tiny loft bathroom , grr , but when we saw this at Ikea the light bulb went on and we knew it would be the perfect storage solution for our small bathroom ! I 'm loving the silver has me thinking about giving it a quick spray paint makeover : ) <p> Well , Mimi beat me to my suggestion , but just thought I 'd reiterate . I did that once a while a go and it worked out very well . Just make sure to screw into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of screws on each side . Where did you move the cute vanity stool ? Beautiful transformation . CTD <p> Wow LOVE it ! ! ! Super smart solution . I love metalic spray paint . Your affinity for spray paint inspired me to re-do some frames with it recently . I am so happy that I was able to re-use what I had . Thanks for this great idea ! <p> I used two of these next to my newly painted credenza but painted them in gold . Ca n't beat the price right ? I too painted the wood top and bottom pieces but in gold . Such a great shelving unit for any space . <p> It looks wonderful Kate . I recently picked up a similar looking shelf at my local Salvation Army store for $10.00 . It was kind of gross looking dirty gold colour and a bit sticky yuck . But it had 3 mirrored shelves so I took it home , cleaned and painted it silver and now it could be utilized in any room of the house . <p> I just returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! I think I also have a love/hate relationship with my navigation system . Took me into Manhattan instead of the Garden State on the way backmore money , more time , way more traffic , but hey , its a nice day for a drive : ) . <p> I love you for posting this ! I just painted a double one brass for my family room , but I 'm bugged by the plastic top and bottom shelves ! They look great painted silver , but I 'm afraid brass would be too much . I am debating having glass cut or possibly a mirror for the bottom . Any advice ? <p> Hey Cammee , I say " bling " it on ! I do n't  think the brass/gold shelves would be too much , do n't  forget the bottom one is mostly covered with your stuff ! If you do n't  like the top one the brass/gold color then yes , definitely have a piece of glass cut that will be fab ! Kate <p> To maximize your access to the drawers , you could take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the bottom drawer . Then it would pull open and you 'd have access to the other drawers above it . <p> These look so beautiful both here and the ones you did before . I have a questionare there adjustable feet on the bottom ? I have a little area between my fireplace ( it protrudes out into the living room ) and the wall and this would be perfect , but I think the floor is a bit unlevel and I would need something I could adjust the feet for level . I do n't  see any mention of it on the IKEA site . <p> I have been looking for a storage solution for my upcoming bathroom reno . I originally thought closed storage but since our vanity is large Im thinking I might have to try this out . You really ca n't beat under $50 ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057786 @3257786/ <h> X Leg Bench ( Guest Tutorial ) <p> By Kate Riley August 9 , 2012 <p> Hi everyone , I have a special guest today ! - I love a great DIY project , especially this one that combines power tools , beautiful fabric , and nailhead trim to create a custom X leg bench ( or ottoman ) for extra seating or staging around the house X base furniture is a favorite of mine , offering a stylish alternative to straight legs , and the smaller upholstered benches look especially fantastic at the end of beds. - Today , I invited Jennifer of The Chronicles of Home to share her technique on how to make your own X leg bench . <p> " Hello CG readers , I 'm so thrilled to be guest posting for Kate today , on one of my all-time favorite blogs , while she 's on vacation ! - And perhaps equally excited to be sharing a tutorial with you on how to make this cute X-leg upholstered bench . <p> Whether you call them X leg stools , X leg ottomans , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for extra seating anywhere you need it because they 're so lightweight and moveable. - They can be stored away against a wall or under a table when not in use , grouped around a coffee table , used as a coffee table alone or in a pair , or grouped at the bottom of a bed. - The possibilities are practically endless ! <p> I 've had my eye on a pair of them for my living room for awhile now but decided I wanted to try my hand at making them myself instead of buying them , both to cut costs and because I love making furniture and seeing how things go together. - My two primary inspiration pieces were these : <p> I liked the chunky legs on the bench at left and the streamlined , nailhead-studded top of the one on the right. - I tend to be a visual thinker so took an old piece of cardboard and drew a sketch of the finished piece. - I 'd recommend doing the same so you have a reference to be sure your angles are cut correctly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work for these measurements , giving you a finished X-leg bench that is 17 ? square and 17 ? high. - You can change the length of the bench from one X-leg to the other without needing to make any angle changes but any shift in the width or the height of the bench will alter the angles needed to make everything fit together properly . <p> I like to make my first cuts using scrap wood and then lay them on top of my sketch to be sure I do n't  make mistakes and waste my nicer materials. - I cant tell you how many times Ive cut my angles going in the wrong direction and am always so much happier when that happens on scrap wood ! - When you 're ready to get started , use a miter saw to make the following cuts : <p> 1 1/2 ? - x3/4 ? oak hardwood planks cut one end at a 50- angle. - Measure 9 1/2 ? from the pointed side and cut the other end at a 9- angle. - Do this process eight times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 ? x 3/4 ? oak hardwood planks cut one end at a 50- angle. - Measure 19 ? from the pointed end and cut the other end at 50- as well. - Do this process four times , giving you four identically-cut pieces of wood . <p> 1 1/2 ? x 3/4 ? oak hardwood planks cut one end at a straight angle. - Measure 17 ? and cut the other end at a straight angle as well. - Do this process twice , giving you two identically-cut pieces of wood . <p> 1 1/2 ? x 1 1/2 ? oak hardwood plank cut one end at a straight angle. - Measure 14 ? and cut the other end at a straight angle as well. - You only need one piece cut like this . <p> You will also need a piece of 3/4 ? plywood cut to a 17 ? square , 4 ? -thick foam cut to 17 ? square , at least a 30 1/2 ? square of cotton batting , at least a 30 1/2 ? square of the fabric you want to use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholstery nails ( I used 88 nails purchased from Lowes ) , a staple gun and staples , 1 1/4 ? and 2 1/2 ? finishing nails , and 1 1/2 ? wood screws. - I needed four 6 ' -long 1 1/2 ? x3/4 ? oak planks to make the first three groups of cuts above . <p> Once the wood is cut , use sandpaper or a pad sander to sand it down. - Lay one of the 19 ? pieces on the ground. - Lay one of the 9 1/2 ? pieces on top , lining up the ends , to determine which sides will be facing each other. - Spread wood glue on the bottom side of the 9 1/2 ? inch piece and press into place on top of the 19 ? piece , fine tuning the positioning so all edges line up exactly. - Lay another of the 19 ? pieces on top , perpendicular to the 9 1/2 ? piece , and repeat the wood glue and positioning process on the other side with another of the 9 1/2 ? pieces. - Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood has slipped . <p> Do this same thing with the other two 19 ? pieces and two more of the 9 1/2 ? pieces. - Let the glue set up for 30-60 minutes , then carefully flip the glued Xs over and follow the same process with the remaining four 9 1/2 ? pieces. - Also add a dab of glue in the center notch where the two pieces fit together. - Let the glue dry fully overnight. - Once dry , hammer three 1 1/4 ? finishing nails down each length of the 9 1/2 ? pieces and into the longer leg . <p> Lay one of the Xs on the floor and put a dab of wood glue in the center. - Position the 14 ? piece of oak in the center and let dry 30-60 minutes . <p> Carefully place the other X on top of the 14 ? piece. - And then very , very carefully , pressing the Xs together , place the legs on the floor as they will stand when finished , to be sure everything is lined up properly. - Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the glue to completely dry. - The positioning part is very important or you could be left with a wobbly , uneven leg base . <p> When the glue has dried completely , hammer two 2 1/2 ? finishing nails through each outside X-middle into the center piece to strengthen the bond between the X-legs and the middle piece. - Then stain the wood using the stain of your choice ( do n't  forget to stain those two 17 ? straight pieces ! ) . - For this bench , I used Minwax oil-based stain in Kona . <p> To make the top , lay the batting on the floor , then center the foam and plywood on top. - Wrap the batting snugly around the foam and plywood , a bit like wrapping a present , and staple to the plywood . <p> I 'm going to deviate a bit from my actual process here and make a different suggestion for making the cover. - If you 're a confident tailor , by all means , sew a cover for the top. - I 'm a semi-confident seamstress and chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much easier to have done a no-sew cover. - To do this , you lay your fabric down on the floor , back side facing up. - Lay the batting-wrapped seat upside down on top of the fabric . <p> Pull the fabric up over the box on one side rather snugly and staple to the plywood a few times in the middle , leaving the edges unstapled for now. - Repeat for the side across from the one you just stapled. - Then play with tucking and folding the edges until you get a smooth , flat , folded edge. - You can press a warm iron on top of the fold when you have it a way you like to press the fabric even more flat. - See the below picture from a previous reupholstery job for an example of what it should look like . <p> Once you have the folds as you want them to be , finish pulling the fabric underneath and stapling to the plywood so all is secure. - Flip the seat over and , using a ruler , mark dots 3/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the seat. - Hammer the upholstery nails on top of the marked dots . <p> Place one of the 17 ? straight-cut pieces on top of one of the X-legs and position so the ends are flush. - Holding tightly , pre-drill small holes to make sure the screws go in straight and everything lines up. - Drive a 1 1/2 ? wood screw through each pre-drilled hole , one on each end , then repeat on the other X-leg . <p> The final step is laying the assembled , covered seat upside down on the floor , carefully positioning the X-base upside down on top of it , and pre-drilling a couple holes at a slight angle in the middle of each 17 ? piece , now attached to the X-base. - Drive a 1 1/2 ? wood screw through each hole , and repeat on the other side . <p> Flip it over , and have a seat or prop your legs up ! <p> I hope you all enjoyed the tutorial on how to make an X leg bench ! - Feel free to contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime at The Chronicles of Home. - - Thanks so much to Kate for having me as a guest today ! " <p> Thank you Jennifer for sharing your beautiful piece with us today . - What say you readers , do you have a place for an X- leg- bench in your home ? <p> Allison is right . This project is not structurally sound , at least not for holding any sort of weight ( like a person ) . The short pieces of each X need to be attached to the longer pieces of the X with more than just wood glue , or else eventually the whole structure will collapse when weight is put on it . <p> That said , its really , really pretty and these plans are a great start for how to build an X bench ! <p> Hi everyone ! Thanks for all the nice comments on the X bench . Just wanted to address a couple of the comments above in case some others have similar questions or concerns . <p> Regarding the cost of making the bench , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $10/yard and I used less than a yard . I had everything else left over from other projects but believe you could make the whole thing for under $50 . <p> As far as how sturdy the bench is , we 've been sitting on it for a few weeks now and its as sound as can be ! The use of both wood glue and nails in constructing the base doubles the strength and the puzzle-y way the pieces fit together naturally adds support . I can push , rock , and shake mine and it does n't  budge . <p> Love this little bench . This would be perfect for my make up area I 'm creating in my closet . Thanks for sharing this ! Now let 's see if I 'm able to actually pull this off . It just might end up on my Hubby to-do list : ) <p> Beautiful bench-beautiful tutorial ! Thank you . I love how chunky the legs are and the simplicity . I bought two of these at K Mart and need to cover the original fabric . I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> For those of you asking about the fabric , I bought it online at Fabric.com . Its made by Waverly , the pattern is called Ellis , and the color is Hemp . They also carry it in other colors . <p> Just to be clear regarding the structural questions , I did n't  use just wood glue for any part of the base . Every time I used wood glue , I let it dry then reinforced it with finishing nails . Each X has a total of 12 nails supporting the legs ( see photo where there are arrows pointing to here they should go ) . The bar across the middle is glued to the Xs then two 2 1/2 nails were driven in each side to help ensure strength . It absolutely holds the weight of a person . <p> Thank you so much !

I really do n't  have $1000 to spend on these two items so I am using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands help ) . Once again thank you thank you ! Well done . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057792 @3257792/ <h> From Bronze to Silver : Lamp Transformed <p> By Kate Riley March 29 , 2010 <p> Over the past months , I 've been putting just a few finishing touches on my stepdaughter 's bedroom , and one of the last things I wanted to do for her was inject the space with a dash of big girl glam . As you know from my fixation on metallic finishes , I 've been wanting to silver leaf something , anything , for quite some time . An inexpensive bronze Kmart lamp became the victim . I 've had this lamp for over three years and it was just looking a little , well , plain to me . So rather than buying her a new lamp , I just decided to give it a glitzier look . <p> Now , for those like me who adore all things shiny , feast your eyes on my latest transformation , a lamp refinished in silver leaf . <p> Before and After : <p> This project was incredibly simple , and took only a few hours to complete . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come a little closer , I 'm about to say something that the silver leaf company does n't want to tell you . There is no need to buy those expensive adhesives and coating sprays that are sitting there next to the metal leaf products . Sssssh . It was n't me who told you . Pass it on . This message is brought to you by a gal who has silver leafed only one thing in her entire life . <p> But seriously , other than the $10 dollar package of silver leaf available at a craft store , I used products I already had for this project including multi purpose spray adhesive and Minwax Polycrylic to seal . I 'm sure the other products designed for applying metal leaf are fine and dandy , I 'm just a cheapo , and I wanted to save the $15 bucks . <p> The instructions tell you to use wax paper to iron on ' the leaf with your fingers to the wax paper before you apply it . Hey , it worked ! This stuff is incredibly thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper as a guide . <p> I applied my spray adhesive to the area of the lamp where I wanted to apply the leaf , and used the backs of my fingers to adhere it to the lamp . <p> I cut smaller sections for the skinnier and curvier parts . <p> When I was done , I applied two coats of Minwax Polycrylic to the lamp to protect the finish . That 's it ! <p> Flirty gray lampshade from Tarjay . <p> Some of you spray paint devotees are thinking why not just use silver spray paint ? You 're right , I thought of that . After all , I am a self confessed spray paint junkie , and there are a ton of metallic spray paints available . Valspar has an entire metal ' series that is fab ! However , I 've been wanting to experiment with silver leaf forevah , and I like the subtle textural difference between a smooth spray painted surface and an silver leaf crinkly surface . Glamour injection ? Check . And my daughter loves it ! <p> What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pale moonlight ? Er , I mean , have you ever used this product , and what were your results ? <p> I did the same thing with a thrift store lamp . I loved how it turned out , except I was n't sure about the shade so I kept the plastic wrap on . My husband relegated into the garage and I am going to sneak it back into my daughters room once I find her a desk . <p> Oooh la la . That is what thing I have never tried before . I even got some for free from a friend . I guess I have had the inspiration strike yet . But silvers are growing on me . I am redoing my master bath in blues . white and silvers . I am going to paint my nasty oak cabinets in there . And you , my dear , are my inspiration . In my head I want to do a Silver Sage base with some sort of blue wash and a opulence pearl over the top . Plus wallpapered insets like your cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , my cabinets are not real wood everywhere so I feel like I cant do the same treatment as you did . You are queen of finding cool inspiration pics . Have you seen anything like that ? <p> I want you cream cabinet makeover with your patina dresser mixed together but with more of a blue than a turqouise . Confused <p> Are you kidding me , I love this and I love even more the fact that you gave us such great hints about not needing the extra steps . You always do such great work and I think this one is just as good as all the others . Thanks for always inspiring me . <p> Oh my goodness ! ! I love this project ! ! I have wanted to do something with metallic leaf but I 'm too afraid to try . Isnt that awful . The worst part is I have bought it and the sticky sizing and all , but it kind of just sits on the shelf . This is some serious push here . Thanks for the inspiration . <p> Gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors in the room and those beautiful flowers ! I silver leafed a mirror once . It was my first time and I did n't  put a dark base coat on , which I should have . I am going to redo it . I did n't  realize you did n't  need to use the sizing . Good to know ! <p> Hi I just popped over from Tracis Linky party at Beneath My Heart . I love your lampbase it is just perfect for a girly room . Thanks for including pics on how to do it and your fabulous tips ! I love the silver next to that gorgeous splash of turquoise blue . Wishing you a wonderful day Tina <p> Super scary that you 're in my head right now . Ive been looking for THE right shaped bedside tables to give this treatment to , its the only glam I plan on adding to the grand master bedroom reno plan . Havent found them yet , but good things come : ) <p> You know , I did your brass/ crystal lamp makeover with the Heirloom White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love how this silver lamp turned out , so I believe you 've just inspired me to move forward with my idea . thank you &amp; awesome job ! ! ! <p> Hi again Katie , loved your playday feature yesterday . a delightful day for your precious family and yum the coup detat the fab chowder at the end of it . so fun to read I was almost right there with ya ! Instead were in the middle of painting the kitchen and I almost scored on your pulls from Tar-jay- but when I went back to get them- THEY WERE GONE ! CLearanced out over the weekend ! So The Home Depot version will have to do meanwhile , I started to tell you before I digressed .. the silver leaf lamp is too wonderful in that room Kudos on picking that lamp for the treatment once again you 've done another WOWza project ! <p> LOVE IT ! And its convinced me that I 'm right and I do need to make the currently green lamp in my living room silver . I used silver leaf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you have to hold them and I wanted them to still open , I 'd do it again in a heartbeat . <p> I &amp;heart ; this lampthe colors in the photos are so serene ! lo , and how funny that you quoted the Joker I ? that movie toothe original ( first one ) was the best ! By the way , thank you for all your wonderful inspirationskeep em coming : ) Nikki <p> GORGEOUS , Kate ! I silver leafed a letter " R " when I was in college , but it I used a kit that was WAY more complicated than what you 've done and yours turned out so much better ! I may have to give it another go . <p> It looks great ! Where , may I ask , did you manage to find the silver leaf ? Did you have to buy it online ? I searched the aisles of three different craft stores and still have not managed to find it . Do you know any stores that carry it ? What section is it in ? Thanks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light but I was under the influence of too much sugary goodness . There there were children involved . And silliness . Much silliness . <p> How well does the poly protect the silver leaf from flaking off ? Metal leafing is a project I 'm dying to try but I 'm afraid of it flaking off after much hard work . How is it holding up ? Did the poly affect the finish ? <p> Thirty years ago ( 30 ) my sister wanted to have a silver frame for her wedding picture that was taken 30 years prior to that and was in black and white . Silver leafing was n't a crafting item at that time.so I had to bright idea to use the thinnest and cheapest aluminum foil I could find at the grocery store and some good glue . Yep ! ! I covered the wide wooden frame with pieces of randomly torn foil , burnished it with a soft cloth and it still hangs in a place of honor in her living room . Just thought you and your followers would like to know of another option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver leafing . LOVE your blog . <p> The " new " lamp looks very expensive ! I want to try leafing , but probably wont splurge for real silver leaf . I found a recipe for the adhesive I may try 2 sheets(diamonds) of plain gelatin to 1 cup of water . I got ta say , yours looks simpler and I appreciate the tip about the aluminum foil . <p> I LOVE IT ! ! ! ive always wanted to try silver leafing something , but never knew what to try it on ! you always provided such wonderful inspiration : ) and just so you know , i am fixated on transforming lamps ( and have been since i saw your crystal and bronze lamp that you re-made ) . every lamp i see , i think " what could i do to make this lamp pretty and loved again ? " thank you for all the time you take doing posts , detailed explanations , before and after pics , etc : ) <p> Now you tell me ! I just bought that exact pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it on Saturday ! However , I 'll redeem myself with the fact that I had two 40% off coupons so I did n't  pay full price for either item . I can not wait to tackle my first shiny project a small baroque-style framed mirror ! <p> I have been wanting to try this stuff too ! So glad you shared your little secret . I wont tell . : ) I am wanting to try this on some little birdies for my mantle . I 'll let you know if I try . Thanks so much for linking up to my party ! ! <p> Hmm as another self-proclaimed spraypaint junkie , I think I would prefer the spraypaint . A nice hammered texture . I will keep this in mind , but putting this sort of texture on a lamp seems a little like putting carpet on a wall . But then again , I do n't  recall ever having seen this texture up close . The lamp is pretty though and definitely meets the glam look . <p> absolutely delightful ! I cant wait to cover something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soft Place to Land and am so happy that I did . Please accept my invitation to drop in at my place one day this week when you get a moment . I have become a follower and I hope you 'll do the same . until later <p> I love gilding ! It is so much fun . Check out the gilding materials from the Country Living Artisans Collection by Caromal Colours . I teach with this in CA . It is way easier than the spray stuff . Its all waterbased , and we have silver , gold and copper leaf . I have some pictures on my website as well as Facebook . We are gilding everything from pumpkins , gourds , apples , leaves , picture frames , cabinet handles , gilding through stencils on walls , trays , etc. etc . So much fun ! ! If you want to know how to get some just let me know . <p> Wow , I commented here almost a year ago and I 'm finally ready to share my attempt at silver leaf ! I posted my lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspiration . I loved it so much I told my husband I am going to silver leaf our Wii. ; ) 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057794 @3257794/ <h> DIY : Colorful Dessert Stands <p> By Kate Riley March 31 , 2011 <p> Hello friends , happy spring , the sun is shining today , at last ! There 's just something about sunshine and bright colors that is making me happier this week . I even painted my toes a bright coral yesterday that 's me , livin ' on the edge . <p> First , make a stop at your local Goodwill or thrift store . There are always plenty of glasses and miscellaneous plates for sale . Often , you can find matching sets , but among those sets are the equal amounts of hodge podge and mismatched stemware . Grab a few of those , the ones with no mates . They 're the cheapest , always less than a buck . This is a great way to repurpose your chipped china too ( like the one below ) . <p> Old fashioned ( wide bottom ) champagne glasses and martini glasses work well , but go crazy ! Pick whatever you like . The more variety in shapes and heights , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemware and plates . Center your stemware on top of your plate . You can use spray paint designed for glass , but some are not designed for it ( or at least they do n't say can be used on glass ' on the can ) . The way to use any color spray paint you want , even those not designed for glass , is to first prime ' your glass with frosted spray paint . It dries in less than 10 minutes . <p> Give each side of your plates and stemware a good coat , both tops and bottoms . Make sure you do n't bump your stemware , you need a clean ring for your silicone . I chose to paint first to use the ring as my guide , and also because paint does n't stick to silicone and you 'll have a slight residue , see below . <p> Next , spray paint away , two to three light coats for the best most even coverage . Never spray painted before ? Check out this article on spray paint FAQs . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in Real Orange and Berry Pink . <p> Once your paint is fully dry ( at least a few hours ) it 's time for the silicone sealant . Use the ring where there is no paint as your guide , and apply a good layer of adhesive sealant around the edge . Lay the rim of the stemware right on top of your ring of silicone . There may be a slight amount of residue around the outside as you press down . It 's your choice whether to scrape it off , but because it 's hidden underneath , I left mine thick for the best grip between the glass and the plate . It takes about 12 hours or more for the silicone sealant to fully cure , but read the package . <p> Once your silicone sealant is fully cured , you can do this ! <p> Yes , your stands are completely hand washable ! <p> Sorry hot glue , silicone 's got ya beat there . <p> Be sure to use layers of paper doilies , parchment paper , or other food safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spray paint , even why dry , is not recommended . <p> I made both of these plates for under $10 dollars total , including the cost of the spray paint and glassware . I had the silicone and frosted spray paint on hand , but you 'll pay an extra few dollars for them at the hardware store . <p> I 'm thinking you could make tiered versions too . Would n't a series of these dessert stands be perfect for a whimsical cupcake party ? Or a bridal shower ? Or for little trinkets or favors on display ? Great for jewelry or business cards too ! <p> If you want the recipe for my orange cake , you 'll have to wait ! Sorry , I 'm such a tease . <p> The marvelous Ms. Layla has an upcoming Spring eZine all about color inspiration , so you 'll see it appear there next month . <p> That fabulous fabric is from my patchwork picnic blanket , I found it at Joann 's , but the receipt does n't show the maker or name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I 'll update the post with the name of it when I find it . <h> 133 comments <p> So pretty I love the colors you chose ! However , the real show-stealers are those cupcakes and cake you 're killing me , just killing me . I desperately need a bite of one of those with my afternoon coffee ! <p> These are so beautiful , thanks for showing how easy they were to make . I 've only spraypainted a few things , so I 'm wondering what works best for the mat so that the items do n't  stick after they dry ? Newspaper makes a mess ! <p> While cute and colorful , am I the only one alarmed here by the fact that you 're encouraging people to use spray paint on food service dishes ? I do n't  mean to rain on your parade here , but this is a major health hazard . That flimsy piece of food safe paper is not enough to protect the food . <p> I LOVE these little stands ! Such a great idea . And I just painted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One question can you attach the stemware to the plates before doing the spray painting so you do n't  have to worry about accidentally knocking them out of position ? Is there a reason the assembly has to happen after the painting ? Guess that 's two questions . Hope you do n't  mind ! <p> even though its a long post and you have to scroll down a bit , you can see the cake plate i made last year using a goodwill crystal cut glass plate and a parfait glass that i glued using epoxy glue . i never thought about using silicone sealant . i have also made them using candlesticks as bases as well . <p> I love this ! I am working on making my dirt and concrete back yard this weeksome fun stuff like this on the table may make me feel better until we have the $$$ saved up for sod ! Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> Youve inspired me to tackle this project this weekend . I am giving a bridal shower next month and these would be fun and colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange . Ill be patiently waiting for the recipe on that orange cake . My mouth is watering now . That would be yummy to serve at the shower as well ! <p> These are brilliant ! ! I 'm hosting a community bake sale in support of the Japanese Red Cross Society May 1st and was just thinking how I can add some colour and beauty to the tables of baked goodies . Thank you ! ! <p> HI Elaine and Stephanie , the paint wont stick to silicone so if you want perfect coverage , I decided it was best to paint first . Plus it gives you a perfect guide for your silicone . <p> Hi AW , I have to disagree ! The layers of doilies are sufficient , plus you 'd be surprised how well fully cured spray paint adheres to glass . I washed it pretty well and see no danger of paint or residue coming off . I do n't  claim its food safe by any means , which is why I used the paper doilies . Thanks for bringing the subject up ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Make sure you use food safe papers to protect any snacks . The spray paint is steadfast once its dry , but not considered food safe , so its best to take all precautions . xo Kate <p> Excellent idea and perfect for my upcoming English Afternoon Tea birthday in May . The best thing is that you can re-spray them when you want a colour change for another occassion and be able to re-use them again and again . <p> Hello ! I have been eyeballing these cake stands in your previous posts and wondered were you found them .. Now I can make them too ! I look forward to you blog everyday and feel inspired when I see it ! I have just started blogging about my design projects personal and clients and all of my DIY projects it is amazing to see the community of people who enjoy the same thing ! If you have some free time check out my blog Living Savvy @ **25;1075;TOOLONG <p> Just a thoughtif you are lucky enough to find two identical clear glass plates while shopping , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the remaining clear glass one on top , you would have no paint contamination worries and it should be barely noticeable . This would make for easy clean-up , also . <p> Love , love , LOVE this post ! ! ! Thanks for the awesome inspiration ! My hubby will be very thankful that there is a much more inexpensive way to match up serving dishes to the theme of a current partyas am I ! ! ! LOVE . IT . <p> My 1st ever comment ( but you are sooo worth it ) Ikea has the perfect doilies to line these beauties for penniesthink I paid $1.99 for my multicolored set of 4best of all , they are very thin plastic so they are washable , reusable , and completely cover the painted area protecting food from contact , while showing a decorative cut edging ! And if they 're too large , you can easily trim them down to fit , giving your own cute edging ! <p> Super cute ! I actually tried this over the weekend . . . I could n't find any cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for candlesticks ! They turned out just beautiful ! I also bought a couple of extra candlesticks to paint and actually put candals in for easter decorating ! My only tip for anyone giving this a whirl , is to try and stick to the lighter colored plates ! I liked the shape of some that were black . . . several coats of light blue later I had finally covered the dark plate ! <p> I absolutely love this idea too ! That makes 2 of your ideas in the last week that I am going to have to try . Youll have to stop producing such great posts until I get caught up ! ! ! ha ha ! Thanks for the fabulous idea ! CC <p> I loved this fabric so much I went out and bought four yards . I 've made three table runners one to go lenthwise on my table and two for the sides so I have six ready-made " placemats " . I put the runners over a peachy/orange colored table cloth and have turquoise chargers that will go under my all-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal candle holder and a birdcage which I spraypainted in two colors of blue . I found cute little birds that clip onto the cage ; one of which is the hummingbird that goes with this beautiful fabric . I had enough fabric to make matching napkins too . I have gobs of Princess House heritage pattern crystal which I 'll use to complement the dinnerware ; wine glasses , salad bowls , small bowls to hold pastel candies , etc . I 'm looking forward to a few spring and Easter dinners with this theme . <p> I LOVE this idea ! I was on the hunt for something to put our wedding cupcakes and mini cheesecakes on , and I thought this would work perfectly ! I tried it out , and am blogging about it in the morning ! here 's a link to my blog : <p> If you used a clear glass plate , you could just paint the underside of that and then when you turn it right side up , the surface where you place the food would not have paint on it . Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide the painted edge if it does n't  look quite right . Just a thought ! : - ) <p> I 've had my eye on that exact fabric at joanns for sometimeIm thinkin it would make a fun skirt ! As for these platesYUM ! ! And not just the desserts on them ! I love these ! One question , how did they hold up to the weight ? I was looking at some glasses and plates but I was concerned that the martini glasses I saw were to think at the brim to hold the plate with a desert . How did yours work out ? <p> Hey Kate ! I know this project was done a while ago , but I 've always loved it and thought of it when I was working on using a little spray paint to give new life to a severely tarnished silverplate bowl recently . Also , loved your post on creativity the other day : ) <p> I love the colored plates . I have made these kind of serving trays before but not with color ! You can make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyurethane , also available in spray cans in the paint dept . I mod podged paper onto tray and made it waterproof by using this stuff and it is just fine . just coat them after your paint dries . <p> Krylon Triple Glaze can be sprayed over the spray paint for a gorgeous " glass like " layer . I usually do two layers and then you can put food directly on the plate if you like . The Krylon will also prevent the inevitable scratching of the plate . <p> I suppose the clear plate couldve been left unpainted on the part that touches food to make it food-safe I wonder if that wouldve looked as pretty , though such a cute idea . I did n't  know there was such a thing that could adhere dishes together . Brilliant . <p> Hi Ashley , I did n't  seal mine with any protectant , the gloss spray paint was hard enough , but there 's nothing I 'm aware of that would make these food safe for direct contact , which is why I used the paper doilies . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! These are so adorable ! I want to make these for my daughters birthday party . I 'm wondering how you spray painted them before you glued them together ? That seems difficult to me ? Could I glue the pieces together &amp; then spray paint it all ? Thanks ; - ) <p> I like how you painted them , such bright colors . When I made some ( years ago ) I glued the bottom of the glass to the plate which made them a bit more stable . I wish I had thought of painting them . Thanks for sharing . <p> I did this project today and everything turned out beautiful . I painted a cheap plastic cupcake stand pink , I painted , glued and sealed a glass &amp; plate cupcake stand , and then I did the same with an old copper candle stand and used a glass plate for the top . I now have 3 great cupcake stands to use at the Farmer 's Market ! Everything was items that I planned to put in the yard sale this Saturday . LOVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The instructions were very clear and easy to follow ! <p> I have done this with colored melamie plates from Target . Dinner plate , salad plate , and bowl and used clear glass candle sticks from Dollar Tree . I also used E6000 glue . No painting needed . They are great on a dresser for jewelry , pocket change , etc. or for holding makeup , etc. in the bathroom . <p> Great idea ! My daughter made these over the weekend , when she went to touch up the paint all of the paint cracked . Any idea what might have caused this ? Any suggestions to keep this from happening again ? Please email reply if possible . <p> This is just a suggestion . For people who want to be able to eat off the plate just use a clear plate and only spray the bottom of it so you still see the color and it is safe . You could also glue a pretty plate on top with similar colors . Just a thought . 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057801 @3257801/ <h> DIY : Lacquer Lookalikes <p> By Kate Riley January 25 , 2012 <p> It has been said to me by my mate on more than one occasion that when it comes to decor I have champagne taste on a beer budget . You 'll get no denial from me . I 've long been in love with lacquer nesting boxes like these and these they are such glamorous little vessels for storing everything small from jewelry to keepsakes . I happen to find them completely irresistible , but the problem is they 're pricey , up to $80 a box ( or more ! ) for the designer versions . <p> So last weekend I decided to do my thang and mimic the look of these beauties with a few supplies from the craft store . <p> To make these yourself , here 's what you 'll need : wood jewelry boxes from craft store , small Phillips head screwdriver , paint colors of choice , wood filler , painter 's tape , medium and small paintbrushes , fine sanding wedge , high gloss coating . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the open-and-close hinges in place . Fill the holes with wood filler ( or wood putty ) and sand the box to get it smooth . Paint the boxes with your base color of choice , but be sure to use painter 's tape in the opening , otherwise your paint will seal the box shut . <p> Once your base coat is fully dry , give it a light sanding if necessary to get rid of heavy brush strokes and tape off the box with painter 's tape to form your stripes . <p> Do you know the best way to get perfectly painted stripes ? I learned this from readers ( thank you ! ) and wrote about it here . Use the base paint to seal your painter 's tape , then paint over it with your stripe color . Peel up the tape while the second coat of the stripe color paint is still wet , it works every time ! <p> I took my time with the stripes , painting the horizontal ones in the morning and waiting till they were fully dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint to fully cure ( at least 12 hours ) before giving it the protective coat . The final step is to give it two coats of a high gloss , if you want a super shiny finish , or you could just leave them more matte , your call . I tried Martha 's High Gloss for this project , and it was pretty good , giving the boxes a nice glossy shine . <p> Allow the nesting boxes to fully dry , and there you have it , lookalikes for a fraction of the cost . Are they perfectly smooth like the real thing ? Nope . Is there some visible wood grain ? Yep , a little . They 're certainly not as perfect as the expensive lacquer versions but they look just as pretty to me . <p> I 'll use them to store keepsakes , cards , or other tiny things . The little one now holds all my business card contacts in my office sweet ! <p> LOVE IT ! I need to do this ! Such a great money-saving idea . About how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the look of these boxes for stylish storage . **37;1102;TOOLONG -Morgan @ A Bright Idea <p> yay those look awesome ! i love those lacquer boxes too but i 'm afraid of chipping them and therefore wasting money . at least with these its easier to repair the wood if need be and you can paint over them if you ever want a different colour ! <p> Great job . I seem to learn something from my projects and I say next time I do this I 'll know but most of the time I never do the same thing again . I would n't have thought to tape the inside edge soas not to seal the box and that would have been my " okay next time moment " . I do a lot of painting and I too love the tip about sealing your stripes with the base color first darn , why did n't  I know that years ago ? By the way I 've found you notice differences only when they 're side to side . The wood grain etc. looks like its suppose to be and looks great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side . ( I learned these tricks a long time ago i.e. if you want to look betteralways stand next to someone heavier than you ) Its all relative : ) <p> I have some leftover Rustoleum oil-based enamel I could try this with ! That stuff is suuuuuuper shiny and has awesome coverage . Weve painted a dresser and our yucky old bathroom tiles with it . Magic , I tell ya . <p> Those look great . To funny too because I just picked up some boxes like that at Michaels yesterday because my daughter loves them . Unfortunately for me she wants birds stenciled on them . I can do it , I 'm just wishing she liked these stripes more . <p> I just saw these on Pinterest a few minutes ago ! So cute and fairly simple , something I can do ! I have so many wood boxes in all shapes includin birdhouses that I 've picked up from Michaels . This could be fun . Thanks Kate ! <p> I LOVE these ! I 'm adding this my list of to-dos . I 'm already thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for my daughters room when we re-do it , but that will be a while . LOL ! Fantastic job on these ! They look GREAT ! <p> Brilliant ! My library is painted that exact color and I 'm always on the lookout for accessories to bring that Tiffany blue color into other parts of the house . To be honest , I actually used a real box from Tiffany on an Ikea dresser ( the box had contained a baby gift ) just to fancy-it-up . Thanks for the idea ! <p> I love your boxes ! ! Did you know that if you paint the boxes with primer first , then sand , then paint your color , that you will get a much smoother finish ? ? If I 'm looking for an extra smooth finish I will sometimes use two coats of primer and sand between them . And now I 'm off to paint some little wooden boxes , too ! <p> Your boxes are stunning ! Were trying to declutter our house , so I 'm not sure if I 'll be making any of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wooden boxes seal themselves shut every . single . time . I close them , though . Thank you so much for that part of the explanation ! <p> If/when we get our place cleaned up , I 'll have to come back and take another look . These really are beautiful , and I especially love the color . <p> Oh I love it ! I do n't  have a thing for lacquer boxes so the fact that the wood peeps through does n't  bother me- they just look adorable . And this is a small enough job that I can try doing it on the porch of my new apartment . I really want to pretend that porch is a garage and just have at all kinds of projects : ) <p> So cute Kate ! I had to go out and immediately get some supplies to make this ( besides , I had an A.C. Moore coupon burning a hole in my pocket ! ) . : ) <p> I had been looking for an excuse to try out some of the gloss acrylic craft paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up gifting the boxes ( most likely an end-of-year teacher gift ) , so it works out well for everyone in the end ! Thanks for sharing this project with us . <p> I discovered your blog this week and I love it . I would love to interview you for a blog I write for Redwood Writers . Send me an email when you can and well schedule a phone interview . ( I live in Santa Rosa . ) <p> Hi Bettina , yes you could spray paint them , being such a little project , I chose to hand paint them instead , but yes you could . Also I know both Krylon and RustOleum offer clear gloss spray finishes , give them a try ! Kate <p> Tsu Dho Nimh has great advice for making them look more like real lacquer . I do know that real lacquer is made from multiple thin coats of , well , lacquer , but there 's a product on the market that is a pour on finish that would give great lacquer-like results in one coat . I think Michaels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Ive not looked for it in years . While its definitely pricier than other finishes , by the time you used enough spray or paint on finish as it would take to make the thick glaze of the pour-on kind , it might be pretty close money-wise and a whole lot easier work-wise . Youd have to take the boxes apart to use it and stand them upside down on something so the finish could drip off and youd probably have to sand the edges where the box closes , but it would give that thick gloss like lacquer . It might be over the top for boxes , but would be great on a table top or chest of some sort By the way , I stumbled across your website just last weekend and have already read almost every post . Your projects are amazing and you write with a very accessible and entertaining style . <p> I also love lacquer boxes . I was looking around for some for my daughters room but found them too expensive . So I decided to give your idea a try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I wanted it to . Thanks so much .

@@99057803 @3257803/ <h> The Impact of Negative Space <p> By Kate Riley February 22 , 2016 <p> I was looking through some favorite images on Pinterest and realized that one of the reasons I found them so captivating was the designer 's attention to negative space . When we decorate we 're so tempted to- fill the emptiness with furniture , art , and accents , yet often less is so much more . <p> Negative space is used in art and graphic design in a calculated way , the point being to use blank space to place emphasis on the highlighted subject . In interior design , the idea is very much the same ; it translates to calculated restraint . Rather than filling up all the walls or corners with objects , spaces , or areas are left purposefully blank . <p> One effect that stems from such calculated restraint is it allows specific decor to shine . In this classic entry , using more art or furnishings or color would take away from the isolated beauty of the landscape print , the pedestal table , and the leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negative space is that your home will simply feel less cluttered . Walls or shelves that are too crowded can leave one feeling claustrophobic . An open bookshelf is the perfect example , certainly it can be used for its practical purpose and filled to the brim with books and accessories . <p> However our desire to collect , store , and display all of our things is in competition with the concept of minimalism and the serenity that stems from an uncluttered nook . See how the white space that surrounds the decor on these shelves creates a calming effect because instead of filling them completely , the designers chose negative space to surround the objects instead of more things . <p> Negative space is also a great styling tool . The use of negative space in photography purposefully- allows for a place of emptiness . The result ? It puts the focus on the objects that are the subject of the photo shoot . Magazines love this technique because this is where they can add copy ( words ) in the publication to explain what 's seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper right corners of both of these images . <p> Using negative space in decorating gives the eye a place to rest . Instead of things everywhere , the edited decor is- a breath of fresh air . It 's like that feeling we get in January from taking down all of our Christmas decorations and the subsequent sigh of relief that occurs from a space cleansed of extraneous stuff . <p> I totally agree . For the longest time I was looking for a piece of artwork to hang in my little library/den. 3 of the walls already have pictures , books and a mirror . I finally realized that I do n't  need to fill up the 4th wall with more visual clutter . It will make the tiny room feel even smaller and more overwhelmed with things . Its a bad habit of mine to want to fill every space ! <p> Beautiful images and great post . I 'm most surprised by how much I love the last oneit would never occur to me to leave the space above a mantel blank , but its just lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a post about negative space ! I find it especially attractive when organic pieces are used as the statement , like the plant in the first pic . Its an artful skill I 've frustrated myself with time and again . One of these days ! Lovely post . <p> Very timely post . The Minimalists have amassed quite a following and whether its feng shui or Buddhist , its catching on , After hearing Marie Kondo speaking at TED , seems we all have stopped stressing over how much time we want to spend getting a " gallery wall " JUST right and would rather focus on capsule wardrobe as The Next Thing . Is home your sanctuary and place of rest and rejuvenation , or is it where you go to forget about what you do the rest of the time you 're not there ? <p> I love this post ! I also love the " less is more " approach to my own home decorating , as an empty-nester , and not too far away from retiring . We have been in our home for 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we go from room to room , refreshing paint &amp; some DIY projects , I have decided to leave some blank walls and spaces , and just some simple decorating done in the rooms .

@@99057805 @3257805/ <h> Painted Herringbone Pattern <p> By Kate Riley November 8 , 2012 <p> I 'm a huge fan of the herringbone pattern that originated with the classic weave especially on floors , walls , and in fabric patterns too ( did you know it 's named after the skeleton of a herring ? ) I love the modern spin with a vertical stripe running through the short diagonal stripes and colorized in two or more offset shades . <p> The other day I was in one of my creative moods so I painted a modern herringbone pattern with some fabric paint and stencil tape on a flour sack then stitched it up into a fall accent pillow . <p> I used Martha 's fabric medium and acrylic craft paints since I wanted a combination of rich caramel and taupe gray . I also grabbed a large flour sack towel at my local mom and pop hardware store they carry stacks of them in their kitchen department for $3 . Martha 's stencil tape was what I used to create the pattern , the product is designed for holding stencils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a pretty basic pattern that does n't have to be exact , I eyeballed it as I went along but if you 're uncertain , you can use a small measuring tape . To make the center stripes , I cut the tape in half and ran it down the length of the flour sack cotton fabric to form three dividing lines . <p> I did n't measure any angles , I just started by placing one strip across the middle at an angle connecting the thin middle stripes and then mimicking that all the way down the fabric . Creating the entire pattern took about 15 minutes , it goes fast once you get started ! <p> Do n't worry about minor creases in your fabric , you can iron the back of it later after the paint dries , but if you prefer to work with wrinkle free fabric then use the iron first . <p> I mixed up the ratio of paint and fabric medium and started sponging the colors one at a time in an offset pattern . Do two coats for full coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-8 hours and then peel up the tape ! The pattern would make a beautiful table runner for Thanksgiving ! <p> Or a pretty tea towel for your kitchen . <p> I was curious about how steadfast the paint would be if I washed it and good news , a wash on a delicate cycle with detergent did n't change the pattern . <p> It dried on my laundry rack and a quick press with the iron brought it back to life but be sure to iron on the non-painted side . <p> Are you a fan of the herringbone pattern too ? It 's easy to recreate with craft paint , fabric medium , tape , and some cotton fabric ! <h> 33 comments <p> Hi Kate ! Thank you so much for all your ideas you have me believing I can DIY anything lol ! <p> I recently painted a shower curtain and I 'm disappointed that it looks streaky even though I did two coats . I hoped it would look like the fabric was already that way ( not be obvious that I painted it ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint and did n't  use the fabric medium ? I wanted to do our living room curtains next but do n't  want to mess them up . Any advice you have would be awesome , thank you ! ! ! ! <p> Yes , I recommend using the fabric medium it softens the paint but I cant explain your streaks , sounds terrible ! There are other brands besides Marthas fabric medium but its designed to make many paints work with fabric . <p> Currently I am in the process of reupholstering my couches with dropcloths . I have been planning on reupholstering these hideous things for the last 10 years . I even bought a pattern years ago . So far ( last month ) I pulled out hundreds of staples and practiced sewing a cushion for a side chair with caning ( thrift store find 6+ years ago ) . I would like to paint something on my dropcloth either for the chair , pillows , or curtains and will refer back to this post at some point . Your blog was my first and has inspired me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I redid these chairs that I found for $5 each . LONG ... Thanks for the inspiration ! -Elisha <p> How perfect . I have been thinking about painting fabric for some time now because I have n't found the blue I want to use in the livingroom for pillows . This will be a great weekend project . Thank you for you wonderful posts . <p> I love geometrics and herringbone is my favorite . I once lived in an apartment in Geneva that had the most gorgeous , time worn , centuries old herringbone wood floors . I wanted to bring them home with me . I 'm going to add this idea to my list ( yikes , its horribly long I blame pinterest ! ) . <p> Incredible , Kate ! I love this . Last year we updated our dining room with a gorgeous 72-inch ( fixed ) round carved pedestal table in a dark walnut finish . So I have put the idea of table runners aside . For centerpieces , Ive gotten by with placing a large square napkin or fabric in the center but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the traditional oblong table runner across the center or even place two in an X pattern ? I 've done a Pinterest search and came up with no tabkescape ideas for a large round table . <p> Hi Christine ! Yes , two criss cross runners would work in the form of an X I also love a layered look on a round pedestal if you 're looking for a fabric covering , think a neutral base such as linen or plain white and then a square patterned cloth on top in a fun plaid , stripe , botanical , or geometric ! Then add your place settings for a gorg table ! <p> These are positively STUNNING ! I will definitely have to try these out . I love the grey but I have a dark brown couch cover ( covering up a HIDEOUS green and red plaid . Not even cute for Christmas . ) I wonder if the grey and brown would still look okay or if I should try it with a brown and a lighter brown or if that would be too much brown . Hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more patience than I. : ) BTW I love your Moms dining room tablescape ! The round balls that look like pinecones are awesome ! I 've already bleached a batch of pinecones for the holidays , but where did you find those awesome round balls ? Thanks for your many wonderful inspirational projects ! 23102 @qwx883102

I really do n't consider myself an expert by any means in the field , but I have learned over the years how to take a pretty good picture of a DIY project , vignette , or room reveal . <p> I wrote an article last year about better blog images , and it was mostly about moving out of automatic settings and into manual mode . It 's a good read , and today 's post really piggybacks off what I wrote last year . <p> As decorators and home bloggers , we are constantly surrounded by gorgeous interiors , whether it comes from shelter magazines , other blogs , or the newest sensation , Pinterest . The bar continues to be set higher when it comes to photographing our projects and our homes . Do n't be discouraged by this , feel the opposite . Any novice can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , projects , or spaces with patience and practice . I know . I 'm proof . <p> I look back at my pictures from a few years ago and I cringe . Just take a look at this and you 'll see what I mean . Back then I knew nothing about photography beyond the simple point and shoot . But I realized that I had to better my ability to take decent pictures if I was going to grow as a blogger and have my work recognized and featured . I 've been blogging for almost three years and along the way I 've taught myself a few of the basics of better photography . <p> So to answer the questions of a few readers , I 've narrowed what I 've learned to these ten very basic tips for taking better images of your interiors or projects . <p> 1 . Invest in a Good Camera <p> I 've read a few posts here and there from bloggers who use a regular point-and-shoot camera , and yes , I do believe a more basic model has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my iPhone . However , a good SLR digital camera with variable settings ( F-stop , shutter speed , ISO sensitivity , white balance , etc. ) is the best ticket to high quality interior photography simply because it allows the user to manipulate the amount of light that enters the lens . And if one thing is true , a great interior shot is all about proper light . <p> Both Nikon and Canon offer excellent choices , personally I use a Nikon D90 and I stick mostly with two lenses , my 18-55 mm lens ( the standard one that came with the camera ) for close ups and a Tamron 10-24 mm lens for larger room shots . A great camera will do most of the work for you , so I consider it a worthy investment . <p> 2 . Read Your Manual and Get Intimate with Your Camera <p> The ability to manipulate your camera 's light settings makes all the difference in the world in less than perfect light conditions , especially when shooting interiors or capturing detail shots . Each camera is slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn where all of the settings are to prepare you for manipulating your captures . <p> It can feel overwhelming at first especially since most manuals are written in technical terms and your eyes can quickly glaze over with all the language . Do n't try to absorb it all at once . Start small and learn how to change the focus mode or image quality one day , then add to your knowledge a little at a time as you play with your settings . <p> 3 . Learn the Exposure Triangle <p> Studying your manual will teach you about the three ways to pull light into your lens when you 're taking your picture and the natural light is not enough . These include 1 ) widening your aperture , 2 ) slowing your shutter speed , and 3 ) increasing your ISO sensitivity . <p> Ack , what the heck ? I know , these are slightly intimidating concepts at first , but you 'll be surprised when you apply yourself that you will be able to understand the basic formula with just a little memorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bulb in your head goes on and you 'll finally get the concept of manipulating light in manual mode it 's a really great feeling ! <p> Here are the basics : <p> Aperture : the aperture is the width of the opening of your lens and it is measured numerically in what are called f-stops ( f/4 , f/5.6 , f/8 , etc ) . Your camera will list them for you as you rotate the proper dial up and down . <p> What 's important to know : A lower numerical f-stop translates to a wider aperture which means the opening is bigger and more light will enter the lens . Lowering ( or widening ) your f-stop also decreases depth of field which results in a blurrier background but it will definitely brighten your image ( great for detail shots ) . <p> Increasing the number of your f-stop decreases the size of the aperture which reduces the amount of light that enters the lens but also increases depth of field ( ideal for larger room shots ) . <p> With aperture , you 'll notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lower numerical f-stop equals a larger amount of light , and a higher f-stop equals less amount of light entering the lens . Think of it like your pupils , which get larger in dark environments and smaller in bright sunlight . It 's the same with aperture , you need a wider aperture ( or bigger pupil ) in low light situations ( wider = lower number ) and a smaller aperture in bright light ( smaller = higher number ) . <p> Shutter Speed : the shutter speed is the numerical representation of your exposure time . In other words it 's the measurement of how long your lens is open when you take your picture . <p> What 's important to know : A slower shutter speed allows more light to enter your lens in darker environments as the sun sets or on cloudy days . However a slower ( or lower ) shutter speed ( especially below 1/10 ) can make your shot blurry because your lens is open longer , so it 's best to stabilize your camera on a still surface or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can work with slow shutter speeds , but when shooting people in action you 'll end up with blur . But since this is an article about interiors , and not action shots , always consider you do have that added option of slowing the shutter speed to 1/10 or below to allow more light to enter the lens because your subject is n't moving . <p> ISO Sensitivity : this is your camera 's sensitivity to light which varies depending on your camera from 100 to 1600 or higher depending on the camera . <p> The higher the ISO setting , the more sensitive your camera is to light . A higher ISO translates to a brighter image , however a higher ISO leads to grainier or noisy ' images so it 's best to keep your ISO as low as possible , typically under 1000 . <p> These are the three ways I always use to manipulate my camera when snapping images of rooms or projects . If I need more light , I simply widen ( or lower ) my f-stop , decrease my shutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apply the Rule of Thirds <p> This is a basic photography trick for composing more dynamic or interesting images . I do n't always use this rule , but I do find it works for more mid to close up shots of a subject . Think of it this way , every time you compose an image through your lens ( or crop it with basic photo editing ) , split the image in thirds from top to bottom and left to right . In other words , imagine a tic tac toe grid on top of the photo and simply place your subject on or in one of the four intersecting points . <p> When you consider this formula when composing an image , you 'll often end up with a more dynamic shot . Take for example this recent tablescape . I chose the napkin ring as the focal point and weighted it so that the napkin ring appears in the bottom right intersecting point of the grid . <p> The result is a well composed attractive image . <p> settings : f-stop 4.0 shutter speed 1/30 ISO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you want to show off your project or space in the very best way you must shoot it in the best light . Ideally , that 's a sunny day with all your blinds open allowing for the most natural light , but in winter or late afternoon , your light is often compromised . Knowing your best lighting conditions is key . <p> For us DIY and home bloggers , this means you should plan ahead and shoot your subject when your lighting is best and brightest , whatever time that is in the space you 're capturing ( late morning or early afternoon ) . <p> 6 . Turn Off the Flash <p> I have n't used a flash indoors in years , instead I 've learned to manipulate the light that comes into the camera 's lens . The flash can be useful outdoors , or late at night , but 99 times out of 100 , using the flash indoors will not produce a pleasing image . I know there are some fancy flashes that you can manipulate that do n't blast your subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For now , I stick to the only shoot interiors in daylight ' rule which is trickier in winter but I still plan accordingly . <p> 7 . Snap from a Different Perspective <p> Some of the most interesting images are taken from somewhere other than eye level . Try standing above , getting down below , or zooming in close when capturing your subject for a more artistic shot . Experiment and play , that 's how you improve . You 'd be surprised how interesting a subject becomes behind a lens when you think beyond eye level . <p> settings : f-stop 4.0 shutter speed 1/10 ISO 400 <p> 8 . Stabilize <p> It 's important when shooting interiors to be able to stabilize the camera indoors especially with lower shutter speeds as mentioned above . <p> Sometimes I 'll use just a stack of books or a stepladder to hold my camera still . Mostly I use my tripod which is a versatile lightweight ProMaster Featherweight 23T that cost me $90 . <p> Tripods range in price , but I recommend skipping the cheap ones you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent one from a photography shop , which you can pick up for around $80 to $120 . <p> . . <p> 9 . Take a lot of Pictures and in High Resolution <p> I 'm never satisfied with just one and I 'm rarely satisfied with ten images of the same thing . Typically I 'll shoot 150-300 pictures of one single scene . I fire away at different f-stops , shutter speeds , and angles and will often take away only ten worthy images from a collection of 300 . <p> I also shoot in high resolution , above 2000 px per image . This is especially important for magazines or websites that contact you and want to use your images , they always want high resolution pictures . Many advanced or professional photographers shoot in RAW ( I rarely do ) but that 's useful if you 're using Photoshop or Adobe Lightroom to edit . I simply up the resolution on my camera settings and use a high GB memory card . I also delete the images I do n't need once I 'm done so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> . <p> 10 . Simple Photo Editing <p> As you improve with your skills , you 'll see that often the camera takes a perfect shot because you got the light and settings just right , and sometimes you 're left wanting more . I tend to like less saturated and whiter , brighter images so sometimes I 'll pull my picture into a photo editing program to tweak the exposure if necessary . <p> There are several programs available that will give your image that extra boost you need . Picnik , Picasa , and Photoshop Editor are all free , I like the first two just because they 're so user friendly , especially Picasa because you do n't need an internet connection to use it once it 's installed on your computer . I also like Picasa because it will tell you at what settings you captured your image , so it 's educational for those of us still experimenting with manual settings . <p> I rarely use Photoshop because I really only know the very basics , and Picasa is so quick and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my images since it reads any font installed on my computer . <p> I 've come a long way with my photography skills since the beginning of this blog with trial and error and a whole lot of practice . I still see grain in some of my images , or there will be times when I do n't like the color composition , or I really want a lot more depth . All of these things will get better over time as I continue to improve my photography skills and experiment with more lenses . <p> For those of you just starting out , be confident that anyone and I mean anyone can improve their ability to take great interior pictures with a little study , patience , and practice . Good photography is a skill that is fun to learn , so be encouraged , enjoy the process , and document the journey . That 's what I 've done . <p> If you want to hear from someone who has years of experience and the most amazing photography skills , come on back in a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the most gorgeous magazine quality pictures and he 'll be sharing a few tips with you on better close-ups and holiday bokeh ! <p> Great post , Kate ! I have a D90 also and I *love* it . Its definitely a learning process , and it took me awhile to understand the " Exposure Triangle " , but I have been enjoying the learning process . I always love your blog photos , so I really appreciate tips like these from someone I consider an " expert " . : - ) <p> @ShaunaI just bought a Nikon D5100 bundle set on Amazon . VERY reasonably priced I think and I love it . There are tons to pick from and I was so torn between Canon or Nikon . My photographer friends suggested the Nikon , so that 's what I went with . Good Luck with whatever you decide ! <p> I liked the post very much , thanks a lot . It is very helpful ! I love digital photography but as you mention it , manuals are so confusing ! The same is tutorials ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greek ( or all of it , it depends ) and use it in my blog , if you do not mind , to help some friends with their photography skils : ) <p> This is a fantastic post ! I 'm especially appreciative of the exposure triangle ! I 'm always confused about F-stops and ISO and the like that little image chart will really help me out ! Thank you for this entry ! <p> This is a wealth of information Kate ! I just got my first DSLR ( D3100 ) and have recently started blogging . High on my to-do list : really get to know my camera . Its intimidating , but your advice is encouraging . Thanks , as always ! <p> Thanks for the tips ! I just received a Canon T3 Rebel for my birthday a few months back , and I 'm slowly learning it by trial and error . I appreciate you taking the time to put some of the crazy , tech verbiage from a manual into a more user-friendly version . <p> Shauna- Choosing a camera is definitely a daunting task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking your options , and physically picking them up . I have a Canon Rebel T1i , which is fairly similar to the Nikon D90 . So , I 'll come from the Canon perspective . <p> When I chose my camera , I made sure it fit easily in my hands . There are many cameras out there that are bulky and fit larger hands better . Those larger cameras are also heavier . When you add larger ( ie heavier ) lenses to it or added battery packs , that adds to the weight . I take a lot of landscape pictures and carry my camera around my neck . You can definitely feel the added weight after a while . <p> Then , you have to check your options . My camera can shoot HD video , but not everyone needs that . So , I had the option of the Canon Rebel Xsi ( without HD video ) as well . <p> Ultimately , I chose Canon because I have a Canon point-and-shoot and have been happy with their products . Plus , I discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lens , it would still fit on the current Canon camera body . Nikon changed the way lenses attach to the camera body , but there 's probably an adapter to help with that . <p> Overall , definitely check whatever camera you 're interested in in-person . Once you find one you like , check online for a better price . Amazon has some pretty good deals . Kates other recommendations are absolutely true too . Happy shopping ! <p> This is so helpful ! I just got a Nikon D3100 a few weeks ago with an 18-55 lens as well as a 55-200 lens . I 'm still reading through the manual and figuring it out , but I love it so far ( even though its a beast to carry around ) . <p> Kate , thank you so much for so generously sharing your knowledge with other bloggers . I check your blog ( several times ) every day . I genuinely look forward to reading your posts , and looking at your amazing pictures and transformations . You are truly an inspiration . This was really helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I noticed how wonderful your photos are .. what timing .. I am printing your tutorial as it is such a great resource . Hmmm , I think I just added something to my Santa Wish List ! .. Thank you for taking the time to share all of your expertise .. <p> Thank you so much for your generosity sharing tips for other bloggers . What a kind gesture . Guess it could be considered your Christmas present to your readers . In my most recent post , I apologized to the readers about the lack of my photography skills . I know I 'm not supposed to use a flash , but had n't  had time to learn the basics of manual photography . This kick-started me in that direction . Now I 'm digging out the manual and will spend some time taking a higher quality photo . Again , thank you for taking time to share something so fundamental to bloggers , yet so often overlooked . <p> I love this post !

Thank you ! <p> I think its my first time I leave a comment here , and its a shame I did n't  do it sooner . And I love your explanation on how to take better pictures with a camera ! It is definitely much easier to read here than what my Canon guide ; - ) And now I will definitely try and use my Canon for real this time . Ive been experimenting with my Canon without really knowing what I was doing , but now I 'll know better , thanks to you ! ! Thank you sooooo much ! Love this !

I took over 80 shots just to get a few that I liked for our cards ! I feel much better knowing I 'm not the only one ! : ) Looking forward to practicing your photo tips . <p> These are ALL great tips . I never thought about checking for the settings on Picasa ! My husband bought a DSLR a couple months ago , and I 'm definitely still figuring it out .

As for the 150-300 shots : He tells me the best tip is to take a TON of shots , so I believe ya . <p> Excellent tips ! Ive been blogging for a year and a half and my photos used to be so-so . Okay , they were bad ! But during an online contest this fall I had the chance for some one-on-one with a blogger " bigger " thank me . Her advice was pretty much what you posted here .

Reading this is encouragement , to just take the time to read the manual from my camera . I know the problem with my pictures is in the exposure triangle you talked about , but its exactly what you said , I do n't  know how to get my camera there . I have to become intimately familar with my camera . Thank you ! Little Bit from **26;1141;TOOLONG <p> Thanks for the tips ! ! Do you have any advice for shooting in low light ? It seems to me that all the successful bloggers have photos that look like they were taken in a light , airy , sun-saturated room I have little to no natural light in my home ( apartment ) and am forced to rely on indoor artificial lighting . In a perfect world , I 'd buy studio lights And someday I 'd love to . But for now , I 'm on a grad school budget !

I have had a Canon Rebel for 6 years and thought I had gotten quite good at it , until I started reading blogs regularly and looking at Pinterest . WowI really suck at photography . I am going to put to practice some of the tips Ive learned here to hopefully get my photos where they need to be . <p> Well Kate , I have spent my entire day with you !

I do , its so fun- to see the all the- collections revealed , what 's new and what 's trending. - I study the cozy layered spaces , the best ones mixing wood tones and/or painted finishes with a variety of textures including beautiful fabrics , woven and organic materials . I also look for a touch of metal somewhere , cooler chromes and silvers- or warm gold and copper . Metallic sheens add that extra layer of luxe , they pop out at me as I pour over my stack of fall catalogs , latte in hand . I 've noticed a few visiting some shops recently too , here are some favorites ! <p> First up this coffee table that I 'm crushing on and considering for our family room , it 's the right size and brings a touch of glam . Slightly out of my budget but I absolutely love it ! <p> Next up this curvy brass shelf . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 80s but the shape is reinvented with a modern twist featuring more elegant lines and in brushed metallic gold . I have n't seen this particular piece in person but at first glance I find it very chic for a living room or home office ! <p> I spied this last month at World Market and tried to think of a place to put it , this desk makes an instant home office anywhere . Elegant enough to tuck under a window in a bedroom or living room and of course perfectly placed in a home office . <p> Rose gold and copper are just as alluring this season as they were last autumn . This pair of tables can be pulled up anywhere next to a chair or sofa or tucked in a corner , the skinny design makes them perfect for potted plants or as a place to set your beverage . <p> A console table multitasks , squeezing into hallways , up against walls in dining and living rooms , and behind sofas too . This streamlined gold version is at home in any space from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love receiving all of the Fall catalogs ! I adore the Gold + Marble coffee table in the first pic .

Now all I need to do is convince the husband that we absolutely need it ! Thanks for posting real product that real consumers can afford ! 23102 @qwx883102

You knew when I spied those jeweled wineglasses at Chateau St. Jean winery last weekend that I would be forced , literally forced , to recreate the look for less . Just cause it 's in my DNA . <p> I spied some beautiful crystal wineglasses and a gorgeous hurricane on this outing at one of my favorite wineries a few weekends ago . <p> I literally choked when I saw the price tag . $75 dollars ! For each wineglass ! ? Gag me with a spoon . I wo n't even mention what they wanted for the hurricane . <p> So my little brain clicked into gear . How is this made ? It 's certainly not hot glue .

You are probably right , just like when I see something I have to start imagining it as something else . DNA or a disease , its up for debate .

@@99057817 @3257817/ <h> Kitchen Lighting Switcheroo <p> By Kate Riley September 24 , 2012 <p> We made a change in the kitchen last week , something I 've been wanting to do for months now . A couple of years ago , I found a free fixture at Habitat ReStore , brought it home , rewired it , and painted it white . That free fixture hung in our kitchen for two years and it was really great ( especially since it was free ! ) but I 've been dreaming of something a little more snazzy . I wanted to mix it up and bring in some lighting that was bigger , bolder , and modern . <p> I 've been fixated on statement pendants over kitchen islands lately , so I finally decided it was time to upgrade ours . Say hello to the two new polished nickel lantern fixtures that now hang over our kitchen island ! <p> They 're really gorgeous in person but do you notice the slight problem ? <p> At first , we could n't figure out why one was slightly lower than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . The ceiling was n't crooked , what could be wrong ? So we stared at it for a few minutes , then Matt noticed the difference . <p> It took five whole seconds to fix the pendant late last night and I did n't feel like reshooting new images . Anyway , they 're perfectly even now . <p> Here 's the old ( free ) fixture that was hanging in the kitchen before we started : <p> We had only one round electrical box for a single chandelier and we did some research online on how to turn one into two . I love a great DIY project , but I get squeamish with wiring walls since I 've never done it before , so we hired an electrician who came highly recommended to do the switcheroo for us , and I 'm so glad we did ! <p> First we decided the proper spacing for the new fixtures while holding them up above the island . Then our electrician cut open new holes in the sheetrock with a hole saw to anchor new round boxes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing with the wall in our hallway bathroom too , since we 're switching from one overhead fixture to two sconces on the wall in that space more to come on that remodel soon . ) <p> The center hole was patched with joint compound for sheetrock , then the next step is to sand it smooth , prime with water based primer for walls , and touch up the paint . <p> The polished nickel finish on these lanterns sparkles like jewelry , I 'm pretty crazy about them . They make quite the statement when you enter the room ! <p> I also pulled a switcheroo on the mantel shelf above the range . I kept the collection of white ceramics , several of them thrift store finds , but added some new botanical prints . <p> To see more scenes from our kitchen , take a peek at this post from earlier this year . Aaaaaand speaking of mantels , the Fall Mantel Link Party posts tomorrow at 8 a.m . PST . I 'll snap some pics of our living room mantel today and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 60 comments <p> Oooh la la , I love them ! I 'm really having a thing for lantern-style lights right now , and I think your two new pendants look fabulous . Also have to say that I love the style of those botanical prints too . Hopping over to check out the etsy shop now ! <p> I love the lanterns ! ! They are gorgeous . I also love the botanical prints . My mom just gave me some hand-me-down kitchen tiles to hang from her mothers kitchen they are 70s brown with an artichoke and mushrooms on them : ) <p> Wow those are stunning ! I love that you added a modern touch to your more traditional kitchen . The difference between the two styles makes the lights stand out in a fabulous way . Lovely , and definitely worth the splurge ! <p> I love the new lights , but wondered about the wiring job . I just bought a house and wanted to move change and move the light fixture over my breakfast table by about a foot . My dad said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved it then I could n't just plaster over the old hole because it would be a violation of housing code . We have decided to instead cover the hole with a ceiling medallion so it would still be accessible if needed . How were you able to plaster over the old junction box without violating housing code ? <p> Hi Jen , there is a process that is required by code , different counties and states are different but your dad is right , you have to follow your local codes . I was gone during the hour our electrician did the wiring running errands but as I recall from what he told me , he routed the existing wires to one new pendant , closed off the existing box in the center before it was patched , and then ran new wires to the new pendant . Kate <p> Love your new lanterns ! As my husband and I work our way through the fix up on our 1983 home , we have what I call " place holders " ex. : the vinyl wingback recliner that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being functional for us until we can find ( and afford ) the chair we really want . I spray painted the dang thing red , and it looks great but . well you understand . <p> Another ex. : the dining/kitchen table that we WANTED was a reclaimed lumber 10 ft. farmtable , but sticker shock sent me running to Craigslist . We ended up with a beautiful mid century " Surfboard " table ( including THREE leaves ! ) for $100 . A good loving up with furniture restoring and followup with wax , and that baby is just gleaming and gorgeous . It is n't what we initially wanted , but we love it all the same . ( and WHAT a deal ! ! ) <p> Some day when I grow up , I 'll be able to replace my Place Holders with my hearts desire , just like you did with your lanterns . Congrats ! <p> Lovely ! The chandelier was so pretty , but I like the new pendants too . Very sleek and elegant . <p> Timely post b/c we just installed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the old one and discovered that whatever dummy that lived here before us simply cut a jagged hole in the ceiling and ran wire through it , then hung the fixture up by nailing it into the dry wall ! How lucky are we that our home never caught on fire ? ! He had to cut some more drywall , put in a new round anchor box , just like yours . We have a lot of patching to do though <p> Those are beautiful &amp; smart girl for hiring an electrician . We started a little DIY with a light and quickly realized we were in over our heads and had to call in folks who actually knew what they were doing . Live &amp; learn ! <p> Your new fixtures look gorgeous Kate ! I actually got the less expensive version with the X pattern from Shades of Light and love it so much . They really have a fabulous selection . I actually have another fixture that I ordered from them and its on backorder till November . Anyway , you kitchen looks beautiful thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mail today . Love them ! But wondering if they 're too big for my space . Would you mind telling me how big your island is and how high your ceiling is ? Thank you so much ! ! <p> Hi Kate- I was wondering if you could help me out with a question I have on these lanterns . I absolutely love them and really want to use a lantern over my kitchen table . My table is 36 ? wide and I know the general rule of thumb is to pick a fixture that is half the width , so technically , I would need a fixture that is 18 ? wide . However , I think these lanterns appear pretty large , even though they are only 14 ? wide and was wondering if you think one might work over a kitchen table ? Thanks so much ! 23102 @qwx883102

Often it 's the designers mix of pattern and color but there is one way to simplify the process and that 's with monochromatic decor . <p> A medley of color is wonderful , but so is tone on tone or single palette styling . You can get away with a mix of pattern and style abstract , traditional , contemporary , large and small scale , it all works when your palette is limited to one color . These neutral spaces are great examples of how calming an edited single palette is . <p> Blue and white never goes out of style , mimic a retail styling trick you often see in catalogs by pairing multiple prints and accessories in a single colorway . Keep it classic by sticking with one blue hue or mix in lighter shades of aqua , paired with natural textures the medley creates a chic coastal vibe . <p> lt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's released each spring , some of the styling is monochromatic to showcase the collections .

That inspiration pix is still pinned to the wall and I smile every time I walk into that room <p> Thanks for the reminder that monochromatic does not mean " neutral " or " no color " but rather taking one color and letting your imagination loose . <p> I 'm not a purple/lavender fan either but those purple lanterns on the patio have given me a wonderful idea for my screened catio <p> This could not be more perfectly timed !

Ever since I visited the Sunset Idea House I 've wanted a living centerpiece of my own and I 'm so glad I turned to Jodi for this creation . <p> While I waited for my creation and watched it take shape I took photographs a few of the other arrangements- in her shop . I was inspired by the creativity seen , how she filled different shapely containers with succulents and airplants and accompanied and paired them with vines , moss , and rocks to create living works of art . Jodi 's work inspired me and reminded me how beautiful nature can be when controlled in a skilled way . <h> 4 comments <p> How timely ! I have had a plate of succulents for years now , but they feel so well they started to propagate like crazy this summer . Now I feel responsible for their offspring and was looking for inspiration . I need to find the right container though . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057825 @3257825/ <h> Flip House Progress <p> By Kate Riley January 3 , 2017 <p> January greetings and Happy New Year ! The past ten days have been really great , I took a break from the blog and most of social media and that felt so good . As a blogger I 'm always thinking about new content , but I forced myself to step away and not worry about it until January . And here we are ! <p> Stepping away helps me so much with clarity and setting new goals for the future . After taking a break and then looking back , I see that 2016 was very good to me in my personal life . I feel so blessed to have had a year filled with exciting travel and one spent making great memories . I flipped through all the snapshots on my phone and could n't help but smile at all those good times I had just living in the moment . My hope for 2017 is much more of the same ! <p> Ive been in Vegas for a week working on the flip house- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over gathering in town and we spent days talking and playing games and it was the BEST ! <p> I 'm easing back into blogging with a flip house progress report . Yesterday we left the subcontractors in charge of finishing the two bathroom remodels underway . Here are a few cellphone snapshots I took before I left town showing the progress that 's been made so far. - While in town we worked mostly on the hall bathroom and the fireplace in the living room . <p> I shared a picture of the hall bathroom here , now its looking very different . We removed the old tile in the shower and floor and replaced it with more modern choices . The new shower tile is larger in scale ( link below ) , it still needs to be grouted . The floor tile is a graphic pattern I found at Home Depot , it also needs grout . I forget the name of it but I 'll share it when I photograph it and feature it next month . <p> I 'm going for contrast in here , white walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chose this vanity and this tile for the backsplash behind the sink , its gon na be gorgeous when complete ! <p> The master bathroom has been gutted and the walls retextured but still needs everything : new flooring , a new vanity , and shower tile . I 'm ordering a custom vanity so this space will take a few more months to finish . <p> For this shower I 'm also using the same calacatta porcelain tile as in the hall bathroom shower , it looks fantastic in person and is so affordable . Highly recommended ! <p> The only thing that 's complete in the kitchen is the smooth textured walls and vinyl plank flooring . Right now its a blank canvas . I mapped out the measurements for the cabinet plan since I 'll be ordering those next week . I like the idea of using green gray cabinets in here with white quartz countertops . Ill share more ideas on this space as decisions are made , catch a glimpse of the before here . <p> The new Armstrong vinyl plank floors were completed a few months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We replaced all the old yellowed electrical plates with white ones , the baseboards are also new . The walls are painted Gliddens White on White which I also used in the community spaces in the first Vegas remodel . Weve measured for new windows and they will replaced in February . <p> We also finished up a remodel of the fireplace with marble stone tile and a DIY mantel . Ill share the details and better pictures of the fireplace makeover tomorrow . <p> Fingers crossed we can finish up the bathrooms and kitchen by late spring since the plan is to stage it and put it on the market before summer . Much to do ! - : ) <p> When I read the words " re-texturing the walls " I immediately wondered if you have the same problem as us . When we tried removing the wallpaper in the bathroom , it was immediately obvious that the drywall had not been primed nor had sizing been applied prior to the paper and we have an absolute mess . We are at odds about what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts but am hoping you 'll reply with your plans . We are considering a knock-down drywall mud application as a last resort . I wish you were here to advise us but must settle for your blog posts . Thank you . <p> We like the look of smooth textured walls the old walls were beige knockdown and retexturing them to level 5 smooth and painting them fresh white makes the older home feel brand new . But weve also experienced drywall damage and had to texture in those circumstances too . <p> So Gorgeous and I look forward to seeing the updates . I love two things about this post especially : 1 . There does n't  appear to be a panicked rush to get the flip house done . You are taking your time to do it right and I love that it does n't  appear to be a stress in your life . It should be a fun project and it sounds like it is fun ! <p> 2 . I 'm grateful for the positive outlook on 2016 . Everyone was so excited to bid 2016 farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful year with no unpleasant surprises . Yes , there were challenges , but at the end of the year we were all in tact and well . I got my 2016 Chatbooks and giggled and smiled through them all . I am grateful you showed 2016 the love that it deserved . Wishing you a blessed and happy 2017. 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057826 @3257826/ <h> A New Solution for Transforming Your Cabinets <p> By Kate Riley February 17 , 2011 <p> It 's no secret I 've been using Rust-Oleum paint products for years . I remember back in 2009 when I was spray painting everything that stood still Heirloom White ' . I went through my Gloss White ' phase , then I dabbled in so many of their colorful and specialty spray paints . I truly believe they have the best quality spray paints and I appreciate the variety of their more modern colors . And as you know , I 've always adored Zinsser primers . <p> Did you know both Zinsser and Varathane are part of the Rust-Oleum family ? Yes indeedy ! <p> Rust-Oleum 's motto is a solution for every surface ' and they are serious ! I thought I knew about most every product they had to offer , but I was delighted to discover at the two day event I attended last week that there are so many other specialty products they manufacture , and now am anxious to try several of them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people at the helm of Rust-Oleum , plus I also got to try out their brand new Cabinet Transformations product , which is a completely new approach to refinishing your old kitchen and bathroom cabinets . <p> Ive refinished kitchen , bath , and laundry room cabinets all the old school way which can often require stripping and sanding , but always requires a good coat of primer , plus two coats of paint and a protectant . <p> After much research and development , Rust-Oleum has recently introduced on the market a Cabinet Transformations kit for kitchen and bath . This refinishing kit eliminates the need to strip , sand , or prime . Shocking I know , and I admit I was skeptical . No primer at all ? Seriously ? It sounded too good to be true , and I was very concerned about durability . <p> I learned ( and asked a lot of questions ) about the formula for this new product , and based on the extensive testing in the lab and Rust-Oleum 's reputation for durability , I 'm feeling pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to use it in my hall bathroom later this year . <p> I was able to try it out for myself , and I 'm like a kid in a candy story when given the opportunity to try products that transform outdated cabinets . <p> The kits come in two sizes for smaller ( 100 square feet ) and larger kitchens ( up to 200 square feet ) . Rust-Oleum provides an online tool for measuring your kitchen for this DIY project . This Cabinet Transformations kit approaches refinishing differently than the traditional method of strip + sand + prime + paint + protect . It also works on surfaces beyond just wood , which includes laminates and melamine surfaces . <p> In the shop , we worked with a standard oak cabinet door and all the supplies that come in the kit . <p> First comes the deglossing step . For anyone who 's used deglossers or strippers before , you 'll be happy to find this goes on more like a cleanser , and has no harsh chemical smell . The second step is to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to a primer+paint combo in one ) , a water based low odor formula that cleans up with soap and water . <p> Third ( and completely optional ) is the decorative glaze . Skip the glaze and you 'll have a single color surface ( which I prefer ) , but for those who want to add detail to the ridges or deepen their color , the glaze allows for that . It 's a wipe on , wipe off method . <p> The fourth and final step is to apply your clear UV protective coat to the cabinet surface . <p> The Pros : The Cabinet Transformations is the quickest and easiest way to give your cabinets a fresh new look in a weekend . 1 ) The big plus is the kit avoids the traditional stripping , sanding , and priming involved in the ordinary refinishing method . 2 ) The kit is extremely user friendly , and comes with everything you need . The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow , and the step-by-step is one geared for any level of DIYer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based , so clean up is a cinch . It is also low odor. 4 ) The kits are very affordable : $79 for the small kitchen or bath kit , $149 for the large kit . 5 ) The product has been heavily tested in the lab , and is manufactured by a company with a reputation for long lasting finishes and durability . 6 ) Rust-Oleum backs their product with a money back guarantee , and 7 ) There are over 30 base colors to choose from , from neutrals to cool blues and greens to warmer tones . <p> Factor in the optional glazing step , and you can deepen your color more . <p> The Cons : 1 ) As of yet , no paint swatches are available to take home to look at in your home , you have to choose a color on the box . After a roundtable discussion , several voices including me encouraged Rust-Oleum to provide the consumer some sort fan deck or swatch card to take home and examine in the light of their home before buying the kit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most latex paints ) so there is not a lot of open ' time to work with the paint compared to oil based paints that I 'm traditionally inclined to use in a kitchen . 3 ) The final finish result seems a bit thin compared to traditional primer + 2 coats of paint methods I 've used in the past . Expect even after two bonding coats that grainier woods like oak on the underlying cabinet surface will still be felt to the touch . <p> ** 3/1/11 update : I 've heard from my local paint department that you 're not restricted to Rust-Oleum 's colors . Because the product is tinted like other paints , you can choose whichever color you like from a different swatch . Rust-Oleum recommends you choose a color among their selections for a color guarantee , but note you do have that option . <p> I plan to use this product in my hall bathroom cabinet makeover , so I 'll have more details then after I use it in my own home . The full instructional video is here , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm liking the Linen ' Winter Fog ' and Seaside ' colors ! <p> For an idea of how the Transformations kit would work in your kitchen or bath , you can play around with their virtual tool . <p> I also got my hands dirty with their Countertop Transformations kit ( charcoal finish shown below ) , my opinion on that product later , but you can read all about it here . <p> I 'd like to thank the kind folks at Rust-Oleum for sponsoring the event in New Orleans last week , and giving me the opportunity to ask the million questions I had about this and some of the other products they make . Browse the Rust-Oleum site to see all the solutions they have to offer ! <p> **Disclosure : This post and review is not sponsored or paid for by Rust-Oleum . It is my honest opinion and evaluation of their Cabinet Transformations kit based on my experience refinishing cabinetry , and with the product thus far . Rust-Oleum did pay for my flight and hotel to attend the event . <p> Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen or bathroom ? <h> 166 comments <p> Very cool product . I may be inclined to try it in a bath if I had one that still needed painting . I am currently in the middle of painting my kitchen cabinets the " old fashioned " way or I may have considered it ! Thanks for the review . Looks like a fun event ! <p> I have been looking at this product at Home Depot for a few months . I have the dreaded oak cabinets everywhere . I was thinking of starting small in one of the bathrooms . I was excited when you told us about the Rustoleum conference . I was hoping this product would be reviewed . Thanks so much for the info ! <p> I 'm totally excited for this ! Ive been wanting to try painting cabinets in one of my bathrooms before the kitchen and even then , I was inclined to just pay someone to do it , but now I think I 'm going to have to try this method ! ! ! It looks 1 so easy and 2 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to repaint kitchen , bath and laundry cabinets but always get overwhelmed with the time and labor commitment involved with all the steps . I 'm so excited to finally be able to do it ! Thanks for sharing and THANKS Rust-Oleum ! ! ! ! <p> very informative post ! Thanks for sharing ! I 'm really excited about their new product ! Ive been going back and forth about tackling my own kitchen cabinets . Their method seems like something I can handle ! <p> I saw this at Home Depot back in November or December and asked the guy working in the paint section what hed heard about it . He had n't  used it yet , but he did rave about the DVD it comes with . <p> I 'm actually planning on using this in the Linen color with the charcoal Countertop Transformations in my kitchen after I get my taxes back . I have 20 year-old cabinets that are the original builders usual , semi-glossy AND two different colors . Got ta fix that ! <p> Hi Kate , I do n't  have much experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a project I 'm working on . I have two large bookcases and a small desk that I am planning to paint . They are new and the bookcases are very shiny stained look . <p> How does this product work on shiny surfaces ? I like the idea of the glaze . I would like the furniture to have more texture than just a solid paint color . Will the glaze work well on a flat surface vs . The raised panels of the cabinet door that you were working on ? <p> Can you tell I have n't done this very much ? Thank you for your patience ! <p> Thank you so much for providing the info on this product . I have been considering my options for re-finishing my bathroom and laundry room cabinetry and now I know where I will start . I have seen this product at Home Depot and wondered quite a bit about it . I look forward to giving this a try ! <p> Ive been dying to redo our kitchen cabinets and have been too afraid that 1 ) it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess it up big time . This product sounds great ! I cant wait to see how your bathroom turns out ! ! ! <p> Wow were getting ready to move into a new house and the downstairs bathroom just happens to need a little fixin up . This could be the perfect temporary fix until we get around to actually putting new cabinetry in . Thanks ! ! <p> I 'm with Lori I wonder how this would work on things like my old oak pedestal table with glossy finish that I 've wanted to refinish but too afraid to take the leap b/c of the steps involved . What would you do ? Would you stick with the traditional method of sand , prime , two coats and poly in oil based paints or go for this new product ? Thanks for all you do to make our homes sensational too ; ) <p> I 'm actually really excited to hear about this product , Kate ! Our upstairs bath has a small cabinet that is light oak and needs some paint . I 'd be more inclined to try a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals . Or buying a new one for $$$ . Thanks for sharing your review ! <p> Thanks for the review . I saw this a few months ago in Home Depot and have been considering trying it . I had n't  seen much on the internet blogs yet so it was interesting to see your take on it . I 'm thinking of doing the cabinet in the extra bathroom to see how it turns out . How does the finish feel ? <p> Absolutely ! ! Ive been wanting to paint out our kitchen cabinets for the past 3 years we 've lived in our home , but the thoughts of all that sanding has really stopped me in my tracks . This would make it soooo much less of a drudgery. : 0 ) <p> I have never seen this and I appreciate your post . I have really been wanting to re-do my kitchen cabinets but was dreading all the work I was going to have to do ( I have lots of cabinets ) . I am SSSOOOO going to try this ! ! ! <p> Hmmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a water-based product in the kitchen , but with the grain possibly showing through , I 'd almost be tempted to try this on my fireplace mantel and the railing on my stairsIve been wanting both darkened to an espresso finish ( stain ) , but all that sanding and stripping if I could get a similar painted look , it might be worth it . <p> Ive been wanting to redo my kitchen cabinets for several years ; however , just thinking of all the work ahead has me putting it off to the last household renovation . After seeing this product I think I may tackle the project this year . Thanks for a great review . <p> I 've have the pamphlet hanging on my kitchen cabinet for weeks now , but I cant seem to decide on a color . I definitely think some large swatches would be very helpful or maybe even some sample sizes of color that you can take home and try .

Thanks for your input on the product ! <p> I just saw this at Lowes and as I passed I was hoping somebody would blog about it ! We just gutted our whole kitchen and got new cabinets but I would so be ready to use this in one of my rental units ! I cant wait to see how it all turns out somebody post afters ! ! <p> Wow , this was exciting to see ! I have old 70s knotty pine cabinets and a fake butcher block laminate countertop that have got to go . We just bought our house a few months ago and the kitchen is the last intimidating room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countertop kit is more expensive , it beats having to buy a whole new top when the existing one is totally usable just old and dated . Thanks for your input and demo . I may just have to try this out ! <p> This seems incredible ! I have a windowless galley kitchen and this seems like it might lighten up things considerably . Since we have to sell our home soon , I was really worried about botching the cabinet job , but this seems like it is a bit foolproof . I also like the option of the glaze to add just a bit of depth . Thank you for highlighting this product ! Do you know anyone who 's used this in their home ? I 'm just wondering about durability . <p> Wow-what great timing for me to read your post . I am getting ready to redo a clients kitchen and bought a sample door at the local ReStore and was going to show some samples to her . I will have to check this out . <p> I 'd have to say the finish is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with durability and I 'd rather go with the primer + 2 coats of paint . That way I know I would n't have to repaint them later because of an issue with durability . I might be more inclined to use this on cabinetry that may not be used as frequently . <p> Rust-oleum definitely invited the right person for their conference and to provide feedback ! You certainly have had lots of experience with different products and methods . Hey , maybe you can be on their panel of experts ! <p> I 'm currently repainting the porch railings on our house . I 'm using Rust-oleums rust products and I really like the 1-step , low-odor , and inexpensive aspects of their products . <p> I would love to try their new cabinet transformation productsmaybe on my guest bath cabinets first to try out the techniques and products before attempting a bigger project like the kitchen cabinets . <p> Theres been a lot of buzz about this product in the last couple days and I 'm really curious to see what it looks like 6 months down the road ( more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle Ive been waiting for ! <p> It is an onging debate in our home do we replace the kitchen cabinets ? $$$ do we paint them , replace just the doors and drawers and paint them ? This product makes the latter seem more reasonable and not as intimidating ! Thanks for trying it and sharing : ) <p> My friend Sophie sent me over to read this because I have been talking about painting my kitchen cabinets for quite some time now . After reading your review , I am pretty much sold ! I used the Varathane Renewal kit throughout my house , and although my wood floors werent in the recommended condition , it worked out well . The system was very easy to use , so I trust that this kit would be great as well . I 'm all about simplicity and low odor . Looks like I have a nice project for spring ! <p> I cant wait to hear what you have to say about the countertop product . I painted my kitchen cabinets two years ago ( and wish I had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have helped ) and redid my whole kitchen . But the countertops are still heinously ugly . This could solve everything ! <p> Thanks so much for reviewing this product ! I want to refinish the cabinets in my master bath , but have never attempted such a large DIY project that could be potentially disastrous ! This may be the way I should go . So glad you showcased it ! <p> Ive been dying to paint my bathrooms and kitchen for a while but did n't  lay my hands on it because of the stripping and sanding process . This product sounds wonderful ! I am so excited to give it a try ! <p> Saw this on Apt . Therapy the other day . Glad to see you review it and anxious to hear your " real life " observations . We are slowly working on our kitchen/dining room and cabinet refinishing is on our list of things to do . <p> I am definitely interested in trying this product ! I have been wanting to paint the oak cabinets in our bathrooms and kitchen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it since I have n't worked on a project that big before . The only thing holding me back on this product is the thinner finish . I am not sure I want to have such a grainy finish on my painted cabinets . Ca n't wait to hear how you like the product in your home ! <p> Wow ! I knew it was only a matter of time before the paint companies caught on to the paint-the-cabinets trend . I wish I had it when I did the cabinets in our old house three years ago ; it sounds like this is a great product . I 'm eager to hear your opinion after you work on your bath cabinets ! <p> WHat a great idea ! It seems everyone is painting their oak kitchen cabinets lately so this sounds totally awesome for those DIYers ! I loved reading about this new product and would consider it in my kitchen if I had n't  already sanded and primed ! Ca n't wait to see it in your bath in the future ! <p> Hi Jewel , the product does n't  have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be clear , the product goes on just like paint . If you have a grainy wood like oak , my point was that the grainy texture will still be present underneath to the touch , not as much as the original surface , but it will still be there . The bonding coat does n't  make the oak perfectly smooth , there are still those subtle textures to the touch . <p> Using a traditional method and priming oak with at least one , perhaps two coats of primer then adding two coats of paint tends to fill in the grains more in my opinion . For any smooth surface like laminate or say maple or alder wood , there should be no grainy texture at all with the Cabinet Transformations product . <p> Yuechen , the product is marketed for cabinets , but if you go to the Rust-Oleum site , you 'll see on their additional product usage page they are including other pieces of furniture . If you 're inclined to paint instead of stain your bannister , then yes , I do think it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant transform our kitchen ( we live in military housing ) , but I would have given my right arm ( after the work of course ) to have that when we owned our house . I look forward to reading about your review of the counter top kit . <p> Thank . you . Kate ! I have always wanted white cabinets but somehow got talked into cherry-stained maple cabinets when we built . Well , after YEARS of showing my husband comparison pictures of white versus stained cabinets , he is almost on board to do white . However he thinks itll look amateur/sloppy to do it ourselves . ( This is the same guy whose home office is wall-to-wall Star Wars , what-ev . ) Well , he removed cabinets to add a wine fridge ( woo-hoo ! ) a while back , so we have a cabinet door in our garage and I am all.over.this. product to try out on that sample door to convince him we can do it ourselves . Just a couple of days ago I watched your tutorial on painting your island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw this box at Home Depot and walked by . May need to revisit it since I am looking to paint a laminated piece of furniture . Thank you for the heads upyou are like the DIY Library of the Internet : ) <p> Thanks for this post Kate ! I am a fairly new DIYer . I want to re-paint my kitchen cabinets this summer . I am wondering if this treatment would be a good option for me . My cabinets are already painted an off-white color and I want to go to a more stark white color . I have no idea what kind of paint was used before ( oil-based or other ) . They are solid wood cabinets too . Thanks for any advice you can give ! <p> I just finishing up my three bathrooms in the expresso color with one coat of glaze last month . While I liked the ease of it I found the top coat really annoying to use . I worry about how well it will hold up over time since the paint was really cheap and flimsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how much as it seemed really thin . I also found it hard to get completely smooth which left white marks on places where I missed the build up . <p> I am currently doing my kitchen and chose to go with traditional primer/paint because I did n't  think the kit would hold up over time on a heavily used area . <p> Ca n't wait to hear your take on the countertop kit ! My husband and I saw a demo on it at the Country Living Fair in Atlanta in the fall , but we have n't taken the leap of faith to buy the kit and do it yet . <p> Ca n't wait to hear your take on the countertop kit ! My husband and I saw a demo on it at the Country Living Fair in Atlanta in the fall , but we have n't taken the leap of faith to buy the kit and do it yet . Secretly I think I 'm holding on to the thought that MAYBE we could get granite . : ) <p> I have been eyeing this product at Home Depot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people at Home Depot told me that it was waster based . I would not have to worry about fumes . I would love to hear from someone who used it and thought of how well it holds up . <p> Wow ! I 'm so excited ! I have been hoping I could find an inexpensive way to re-do my kitchen cabinets and countertops ! I have a grainy wood ( oak ) for my cabinets and from the Rustoleum website , it almost looks as though its more of a stain than a paint when its on grainy woods . Am I correct ? <p> Our HD does have brochures with color swatches ( printed , though , so not sure how accurate ) that you can take home on this product . I 'd love to see a side by side comparison of this and caromel colors another line I 'm considering for painting cabinets . <p> Just came back to your post to read it more thoroughly and yes , I would like to try out this product ! I 've already painted my kitchen cabinets ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store that priming was not necessary . Huge mistake , and a huge undertaking to correct ! ) . I 'd use this product for our bathroom cabinets . I also have a great oak book display cabinet handed down from an elementary school library Ive been itching to paint it , and I think this product kit would be perfect . I 'd also use it for our coffee table . I cant wait to see the countertop kit demonstrated I 've got some real purty peach-speckled laminate that could use some updating ! <p> I actually saw this in Home Depot when going for another project and was wary , but intrigued ! So glad to hear you give your opinions , as well as the pros and cons ! Thanks ! I think I might try it as a quickie fix until we get the kitchen re-done ! <p> I am VERY tempted to give this a try . Our kitchen has blue countertops and pink cabinets . Yikes ! We 've tried offsetting the pink with a beige paint on the walls which has worked a little , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be replaced , but I could totally live with the cabinets if they were a different color . I wonder if I could talk my DH into letting me give this a try. ? <p> That looks awesome ! ! ! And its affordable enough that I might be able to get m landlord to spring for it ( i.e. take it out of my rent ) . Oh , the thought of not having builder-oak cabinets anymore ! Woo-hoo ! ! ! <p> I cant wait to see what you think of the countertop transformations , too . Weve got 80s mauve laminate , and man , oh , man , is it awful . I would LOVE to refinish them , and doing right before going out of town ( over which time it could fully cure ) would be perfect . Now , to schedule a vacation . . . lol <p> Hmmm , ok here 's my situation . I 'd LOVE to use this on my bathroom vanities . The drawers are wood , but surround is that paper-like laminate stuff that they tack over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , or would it just peel right off ? <p> Saw this at Home Depot a couple of weeks ago and came home to search online for reviews of it . So , I 'm so glad to read your review . Have held off painting our kitchens cabinets because of how many we have and the sanding , priming , painting process seemed overwhelming . Would love to try this , but the one thing that held me back was not being able to test the colors . Ive been considering using SW Creamy for the kitchen because I did n't  want a stark white and also did n't  want an off-white . Did you see the Linen color in person -if so , what did you think of it ? <p> I 'm curious if you would use this in lieu of the standard strip + sand + prime + paint + protect to do pieces of furniture you were planning on painting . I recently tried to take a darker wood dresser and paint it white and the process with fraught with frustrations and disappointment . I thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latex paint with floetrol and still ended up with a lot of brush marks and poor adhesion . I tried to use a water-based polycrylic over the top for protection and ended up with crackling . I guess I should have primed first . = P I was trying to avoid stinkier stuff , since we live in Tahoe and the garage has been about 40 degF of late , so I was working in the game room downstairs . Just wondering if this would have been an easier process with better results . <p> Note to TREVA : Water-based does n't  necessarily mean no or low-VOC . I just tried using a water-based polycrylic and it was to fumy for use in the closed house during winter . This product may be safe and low-VOC , but being water-based does n't  necessarily guarantee it is . <p> Does this leave paint strokes ? I 've never really been able to " paint " something without it looking like it was " painted " . I would love to do this on my kitchen cabinets , but my house is brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want it to look bad . I like that the oak texture will still be there , but want to make sure its smooth . What do you think ? How were the paint strokes when you were testing it ? <p> Hey , Kate ! This does look like an amazing product , I can see someone using this who is not experienced in painting cabinets and might want to take a little shortcut . Definitely looks like a good product to try out . Love those 3 colors you featured . <p> Wish Rustoleom would have invited ME to be there with you all ! I 'm heading down tomorrow to enjoy a few days with my niece . Glad you enjoyed your visit too . <p> I actually just THIS WEEK used their countertop paint " kit " ( really its only one can ) . You can see the results here in my own home . <p> As for this cabinet paint , I am totally excited about the product and cant wait to try it out in my bathrooms . I plan on replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great to freshen them up a little for now . Thanks for posting about this , I 'm really looking forward to using it . <p> Forgive me if this has already been asked and forgive me if this is a dumb question : ) We have oak kitchen cabinets and would like to paint them white- can/should you paint the inside of your cabinets white with this product ? I 've always seen before and afters of cabinet makeovers , but no one has shown the inside of the cabinet so I 'm curious . Thanks ! <p> I love this stuff ! I did my whole kitchen in January . If I can find a USB cable anywhere , I 'll send you before and after shots . It was AMAZING ! I couldnt be happier . Well , I 'd be happier if I knew where my darn USB cable was : ) <p> I have white melamine cabinets in my bathroom and would love to try to paint them with an espresso finish . Did you you get to test refinishing any other finishes other than the oak cabinet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks ! <p> My husband and I have been looking at this product for a while now . We wanted to use on our white melamine cabinets in our kitchen . Our main obstacle has been the lack of color samples . Ive been concerned about making a decisoin on color and hating the final results . The " seaside " color was one we were considering but I was n't sure if leaned more to the blue side or green side . Its very hard to tell based on the box and our computer moniter exactly what colors would go best with our countertops . Our countertops are a green stone-look laminate that we wnt to keep for now . Thanks for your input on this product . Its always great to hear real people opinions . <p> I have wanted to paint our cabinets for the past few years . When we built this house , we were on a tight budget . I got 19 maple cabinets off of Craigslist ( for dirt cheap ) which were taken from someones kitchen redo . But there werent enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find similar cabinets . In order to get the same door design , we had to go with a different woodcherry . Well , over time , cherry darkens . We knew this , so we got ones that were lighter than the maple . Fast forward 5 yrs , and the color of the cherry cabs has darkened more than we expected . I just hate going into my kitchen because I can tell the difference in a heartbeat . And I had an appraiser say " Ohyour cabinets are made from 2 different woods . Interesting . " " Interesting " is apparently appraiser code for " WTH ? ! ! " So I want to paint them so badly , but have been afraid to attempt it . This product would be perfect . The only problem I foresee is the fact that the paint coats look thin , as you mentioned . I do n't  want a look that is transparent in any way . SoI am wondering how you think one could get around that . Any ideas ? <p> I 'm wondering why the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polyurethane . I have painted many cabinets and never would put a clear protectant coat on as they tend to yellow over time . Any feedback from the manufacture on what is in this coat and if it will yellow ? <p> Emily : the choice is yours ! Personally , I like a finished look and feel so I always paint the inside too , but if it does n't  matter to you , then the outside frames , drawer fronts and cabinet doors are really all you need to coat . Note , everytime you do open a drawer or door , the contrast will be evident . <p> Kristi , so great to hear ! ! ! Please do send the B&amp;A shots , would love to see ! <p> Sarah , so great to hear you love the Countertop Transformations product ! <p> Carmie , it works on laminates too ! : ) <p> Brooke , gunny you should mention that , the cabinet I show down at the bottom ( white with dark countertop ) had the same situation ! Veneer like sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like surfaces . <p> I painted my laminate cabinets about 7 years ago , the traditional way with Zinser primer and Melamime paint . I was a little impatient , and only used 1 coat of primer and I coat of paint , so now it is chipping off on corners . Will this kit work on previously painted cabinets with Melamime paint , or would it be better to just redo it correctly , with 2 coats of primer and several coats of paint . It looks interesting and I think I would try it . Since I 'm using a creamy white similar to what I have , I 'm not concerned about not having a color sample . The counter top transformation kit looks like an awful lot of work and for a small kitchen like I have , I think I would just get a new counter top . It seems like a good idea , but just too many steps . Thanks for the info and video though , it was very informative . <p> The **39;1169;TOOLONG told me the R countertop product can be made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way as any paint base . However , I am concerned about countertop chipping , heat causing bubbling , etc. , i.e. Durability over time . <p> And with the cabinet product I am wondering about doing the insides of the cabinetry too . Especially since all of my shelves are immovable , and the deep lower shelves in the base cabinets look like black holes in outerspace . <p> Hey , thank you CG for speaking up at the event and sharing with Rustoleum . The things you mentioned are exactly what my concerns have been and why I have yet to invest in these very products . As always , you are the greatest ! <p> Did I mention the same cabinetry is in the bathrooms too ? Except those countertops are white laminate with gold veining yee-haw-gross ! LOL ! <p> I am SO GLAD you posted this . Ive been trying to think of a way ( an easy way ) to refinish the cabinets and countertop in my new kitchen , and these look like they will be perfect ! Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be using some of this stuff . It might be in a year , but it will be used ! My husband loves the color of our kitchen cabinets ( cherry wood ) but all our bathrooms have the standard oak stuff and it pains me to look at if especially with our dark wood floors and dark wood doors and dark wood banisters and dark wood windows . well , you get the picture ! <p> Thanks so much for this great post ! Ive been painting my kitchen/dining furniture lately and the cabinets are next on the list . I also have 30 year old counter tops , so I will be waiting for your post and opinion on the painting kits for counters . <p> We used this product and totally agree with you that they need a color swatch to take home , as matching from the box is not a good way to do it . The color chosen off of the box was much darker on the cabinets . However , after speaking with Rustoleums representatives on the phone they reimbursed us for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the look we were wanting . Great customer service they just need to get their kinks worked out on this new product ! ! <p> I saw this for the first time a few days ago ( of course after we just finished up painting our cabinets and looking at glazing the regular old way in the next week ) . I definitely would have given it a shot if it had been available a few months ago . Thanks for sharing the before/after great product ! <p> Hi Kate . My husband and I are going to use this product on our kitchen cabinets do you know what color they used in the demo you did ? ? It looks like maybe Linen or Quilters White ( the two colors we are considering , minus the glaze ) . Thanks for your help ! <p> Just an FYI on the colorswe had an extra drawer left over from the builder so I picked up a small dark color kit to test it out . I 'm always a bit skeptical with this sort of thing . From the brochure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be too dark . When I went to HD they were out of brochures ( I had picked one up at Lowes the day previously ) and I forgot to bring mine , but decided to go with Cocoa . I did notice on the box , the colors looked a bit different from what I remembered on the brochure , but I went with it anyway . Trust me when I say the colors on the box are exactly as they come out and NOT what you see in the brochure . There is a clear difference in what is on our drawer than what the brochure shows , but it does look just like the color on the box . So , when picking your color out stick to the color samples on the box for a more true color . I 'm not sure this would be such an issue with the light colors , but we have countertops that would match better with the chocolateshould have gone with my first instinct . Well likely use the cocoa in our guest bathroom so we do n't  waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being a DIYer for 25 years , let me tell you this is a TON of work ! I started with textured laminate countertops and even with sanding , sanding , sanding and more sanding , the decorative chips did not adhere ! I applied the base coat exactly per instruction , used the wetting agent and redid one are 3 times and still the chips would not adhere ! For the cost and the work , I should have just replaced the counters , which I will now have to do ! <p> I just used the product and loved it ! Blogged about it ! It only took one box to do my cabinets . I 'm still trying to decide if I 'll use the same color ( Expresso-Glazed ) or if I 'll go with a lighter color . So easier than the " old " method of sanding , priming , etc and so much less expensive than having them refaced or replaced ! <p> Ive been interested in doing this for quite sometime . My only hold up is the top coat on the countertops Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top coat ? Does it cause any type of " de-gassing " when exposed to heat ( i.e. when the stove or oven are operating ) ? I worry about that when preparing food , you know ? <p> I 'm also wondering if this can be used on " golden " oak doors and trim . We are in the process of purchasing a house built in the 80s with ridiculous amounts of golden oak ( like floor to ceiling built ins in multiple rooms , doors , trim , crown molding , paneling , banister , cabinets , windows , etc ) . To my husbands horror , I 'm looking at painting ALL of it , yes all of it ! <p> I 'm very interested in this treatment , especially eliminating the sanding mess . I just redid my old Formica counter tops with Ralph Lauren River Rock paint in my kitchen . I primed used 3 coats of River Rock ( could have used 2 if I 'd gotten my technique down sooner ) and 4 coats of UV sealant . Im thrilled with the results and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with water . <p> We tried the light kit and were less than thrilled with the results on our laminate cabinets . Had to do at least 3 coats of the base and could still see some of the 1980s showing up underneath . We are now trying an epoxy product . <p> I have grainy oak cabinets in my bathroom that I would like to change to white . Will this product cover the grainy-ness of the wood ? Is it low VOC ? If I want to sand before using it , will it still work ? Will a regular brush leave brush marks or should I use a foam brush ? Thanks ! <p> I am using the Harvest right now on my melamine cabinets and it is covering everything beautifully . If you feel you need a third coat you can certainly put it on . The trick for me has been getting the glaze to look right . I just do n't  have enough experience with this treatment but I 'm determined to get it right . Once you put the top coat on while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find that it gives a soft sheen to the paint . The biggest issue is taking your time , prepping properly and being ok with the time it takes to complete . You have to wipe down your cabinets and let them dry , then tape off what you do n't  want paint to get on , then degloss both sides of your cabinet fronts and let them dry again and then apply 2 coats of base and allow 2-3 hours in between coats . Then if you chose to glaze you need to wait another 8 hours before applying the top coat and then you need to give 24 hours before you can put drawers back in and fronts back on . As long as you are realistic in the timeline you 'll be fine and its well worth it . I 'm not even done yet and the difference already is simply amazing . Good luck everyone ! <p> With the housing market in a slump , selling right now is out of the question . I am doing an inexpensive kitchen makeover instead . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem I have had is choosing colors . I 've decided to mix things up a bit so will be painting the lower cabinets with " Toasted Almond " and the upper cabinets with " Winter Fog " . I am going to have new laminate counters done and after that will re-tile the backsplash all the way up to the bottom of the upper cabinets . I wanted to try the Countertop Transformation , but the color selection is very limited with nothing available that suited me . Thanks to all for sharing their experiencesit helps to take away some of my anxiety over tackling this project . <p> I am planning to paint my oak kitchen white so of course I came back to your blog for all the tips and advice . After scouring all I could find on here I 'm still not sure what I should do . I love the idea of the Cabinet Transformation but then I notice that you did n't  use it when redoing your kitchen island . Truly , do you still think oil based primer and latex paint is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " honey oak " golden cabinets to a darker color ? I want to go to Expressor darker , but with an antique-type of finish . I do n't  want a flat black look when Im done . <p> I have experimented on an old pie safe using Cabernet ( the pie safe was a walnut stain ) . I still have the UV protecant coat to put on , but so far I 'm liking the change on the pie safe . I have a lot of cabinets in my kitchen so I want to be VERY SURE before I begin such a huge project . I 've not seen any comments or pictures from someone who has gone to a darker finish from the golden/honey oak of the 90s ! <p> Is there any way to fill oak grain before painting to get a flatter look . I have really nice golden oak cabinets that are currently very grainy due to the poly but some . Would not consider painting if couldnt do some filling in of the grain . Anyone know of a way this has been done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be needed . <p> Has anyone done it on the laminate cupboard boxes ? I 'm not worried about the wood cupboards I 'm concerned about the laminate side of my cupboards . The builders ones have faded and it has left me with a mismatched kitchen . <p> @ Karen I have done two bathroom vanities with the Espresso color . They turned out nice , much better that the " orange oaky " color they started . This product takes a lot of time so plan for it . 3 base coats are needed . I did use the glaze , to add depth , but the color is so dark you can hardly tell . The hardest part for me was getting the top coat on just right . It tends to get white and bubbly as you brush it on . Daping the corners with a rag helped get rid of most of the extra , but even after wiping the bottom edges of the cabinet doors still had a bit of dripping , lucky it is in the inside of the door . Not sure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pre-teen boys bath ! <p> I just tried the linen cabinet kit as an experiment on my laundry room cabinets . I have been mulling over the work of painting my kitchen cabinets and have been too chicken until I found this kit , and it looked so easy ! <p> Now that I 've finished I 'm thrilled with the results compared to the pickled oak I started with , but I 've decided I 'm probably not going to use it for the kitchen . Instead , it just made me brave enough to go get some sandpaper and cabinet coat paint and do it the other way . <p> The rustoleum kit sounds appealing with no sanding , but believe me , the scrubbing with the deglosser is no less work , and there is little visually to let you know you 've done a thorough job . I would have actually preferred sanding . While it also does not require sanding between coats , that kind of sanding is super easy anyway . <p> As mentioned in other reviews , the bond coat is thin . I used 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of the pinkish oak through it where the grain is the strongest . Somehow this did not detract from the overall look . Kinda pretty . You will definitely see the grain of oak through this , so if you want not to , do n't  try this . ( I do not know of a product anywhere that will hide the grain of oakyoud have to use filler and sandpaper , and its generally not recommended as it rarely looks uniform ) . On the up side , this thin paint goes on super easy and smoothly , never sticky like some of the thicker paints . I enjoyed every coat I had to do because it was so quick and easy . The paint levels nicely and brush strokes are minimal once dry . Do pay close attention to drips though . <p> I found the glaze to be too difficult to master . I did not want the overall glazed look , just some color in the grooves . I found it nearly impossible to completely wipe color off the places I did n't  want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth as they suggest did the trick , it also removed the bondcoat ! The glaze does get sticky and the gauze wiping cloth catches on the corners and the stickiness . I gave up and painted over my two failures . The allover glazing is probably a lot simpler to manage , so if you planned on that , do n't  let me scare you off . <p> The biggest complaint I have is that the dried topcoat appears yellow in the grooves and in some corners where it accumulated a tiny bit . Makes the white cabinets look kind of dingy in those areas . Frankly , its the big dealbreaker for me . I do not know how to prevent it from happening , as I can not see it until its dried . I 'm so frustrated by this that I just want to avoid topcoating altogether by using a nice hard cabinet paint instead . I figure if sanding is n't any worse than deglossing , and cabinet paint does n't  require topcoat , what makes this kit easier at all ? <p> Overall , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ( even slightly yellow cornered ) white laundry cabinets . I finished in a day and a half ( no glaze ) and did not find application to be very difficult excepting the glaze . If it werent for the topcoat problem , I 'd be painting my kitchen cabinets with it right now ! <p> I wish I could post a fairy tale comment , but its not the same thing to do one or two doors in a paid for , controlled environment and to do an entire kitchen . I 've repainted many items in the past without sanding by using liquid sandpaper , a primer and a satin finish . The only new thing was the staining . But , following the directions on the DVD , we used screws to hold up our product and ( 1 ) the doors slid on the screws , messing up the top surface and ( 2 ) the screws scratched the bottom surface . We had to redo the doors . But , here 's the big issue : Rustoleum will not sell bond coat . Every other part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of bond coat , the only solution , according to Home Depot and Rustoleum " customer service , " is to buy another kit . $80 was a lot to pay for one kit , but $80 to buy just the paint . Its not a good product , not a good deal and Rustoleum does not support it . <p> Yeah , their inflexibility to sell you anymore bond coat is beyond belief . I would advise anyone that busy this that you MUST be sure about your color choice . Rustoleum will not sell you more of ANY parts of the kit . I bought the large kit in " Porcelain " . I painted the inside of one of my cabinet doors and it just was n't right with the rest of the kitchen ( tile , wall color , etc . ) . I called Rustoleum and BEGGED them to sell me ( SELL me , mind you , not give me for free ) another can of the base and they WOULD NOT do it . They said I would have to buy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative would not let me speak to anyone else or transfer me to anyone else in the company ! ! ? ? Sorry , but that is really poor customer service . The kit is very expensive in the first place , but their inflexibility to help you out is absurd . Even if I could afford another $150.00 kit ( which I cant ) I would never buy anything from them again . " Satisfaction Guaranteed " my foot .. <p> Wish I had found this site . earlier .. two major comments on this product . BTW , I am using tudor ( very pretty ) on solid oak honey colored cabinets . <p> 1 ) Use a heavy hand on the deglosser . If you do n't  , the bond paint will not adhere to the wood . I mean , rub it goodlike sanding with a scrub pad . <p> 2 ) Secondly , if you use the glaze , be super super gentle when removing it because it will remove the bond paint and you will see your original cabinet color ( mine are oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tried the Cabinet Transformtions kit on both bathroom vanities . Im thrilled with the results and cant wait to start my kitchen . The hardest part was waiting long enough between coats to see the results ! Oh , and picking out the new hardware . I made sure to do a thorough job of deglossing and had no problems with the glaze coming off . Love it , love it , love it . <p> Have you found that one method is more durable than the other ? I am trying to decide between the Rustoleum kit and the good old fashioned priming and painting . I know Rustoleum is known for durability , but in your opinion is this product super durable ? Thanks ! <p> Hi Courtney , I actually used the RustOleum product on my guest studio LONG ... It was a quick and easy fix and has held up to date , but that kitchen is n't used nearly as often a our homes main kitchen . but so far , so great ! Kate <p> I used this product in our guest bath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use a conditioner with the topcoat . I was very frustrated with the drying time and felt like it could have finished smoother . <p> Great idea , great price . I bought the small dark kit for our previously painted cabinets . Everything went smoothly until I got to the protective top coat . I followed the directions by applying a long even coat using a brand new , good quality ( Purdy ) synthetic brush . Since the product is varathane it is important to not overbrush . The directions say to then touch up weak or missed areas . Its easy to have missed or weak areas when doing long cabinet doors . The doors now look streaked and the touched up areas look awful . They look even worse under direct light or sunlight . My only choice now is to apply another layer of top coat and see how it dries . Otherwise , I 'm going to have to start all over again . This product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee ! <p> Kate , I just found you blog , love it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning with this Rustolium kit . After reading through your posts I am wondering if we should use this kit or prime and paint with oil based . My kitchen gets used a lot and I just really want it to last . Would you use this product in your big kitchen ? <p> Hi Katie , if I was painting my own kitchen I 'd go old school , with Zinsser primer + paint . I love the RustOleum kit but I have no idea of its durability over time . It is the RustOleum company , and they 're known for their products being incredibly durable , but if it was me , I 'd still prime a heavily used kitchen with a bonding primer then use water based Ben Moore Advance enamel paint on top . On a positive note , the kitchen where we did use the RustOleum kit is still holding up niceley . A few minor scratches around the main cabinet where the garbage can is , but other than that , the cabinets still look beautiful , but again , that kitchen is not heavily used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this helps ! <p> I was wondering if the surface of the countertops are rough or smooth after you complete the countertop restoration ? It looks like it is a rough or plastic type feel in the pictures but I was wondering the texture after the project is complete ? 23102 @qwx883102

I 'm a huge fan of block print fabric so I decided to mimic the look by using some old stamps in my collection and applying the pattern to tea towels to brighten up the kitchen . <p> I used the Martha Stewart paints since they 're inexpensive , readily available ( found mine at Michaels ) , designed for use on fabric , and they come in such nice colors . Be sure to buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft , and washable . <p> 1. - If you want to make your own color , first mix it together , then 2. add the fabric medium after the color is mixed . I used about one part medium to one part paint. - - <p> Next , roll your paint on a nonporous flat surface ( I wrapped a piece of plywood in aluminum foil ) . - 4 . Use the sponge roller to apply it to the stamp. - I found the color came out more even this way instead of placing the stamp directly into the fabric paint . <p> Next , apply your stamp in your pattern of choice. - Sponge roll a light coat of paint before every single stamp for even color distribution. - <p> Change colors and sizes to add interest ! <p> I also made a second version with another old speckled stamp I had in my stash . <p> The paints are water based , so cleanup is crazy easy , just a little water . <p> Allow the paint to dry for 24 hours , then heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain cotton sheet between the tea towel and the iron to prevent direct contact . <p> Once you 're done , you have your own custom tea towels that are unique and completely washable. - I recommend a delicates setting on your washer , just to preserve all your hard work . <p> So pretty and so easy , and they make great gifts. - You can apply the same technique to simple cotton to make pillows or window panels too , have fun creating your own ! <p> Oh this looks like such fun ! Im def gon na give it a try ! For the lady at the top asking to buy plain tea towels , I used to work as a waitress and we had to have plain towels for polishing cutlery and glasses ( the most horrible part of the job , I hated it ! ) and I used to get my in either kitchen supplies stores , or kitchen uniform stores , they were pretty cheap too . <p> Yes Ruth , plain tea towels or flour sacks are inexpensive , I found mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen section ! Kitchen supply stores are the easiest place to find them in bulk , but check around at any place that sells kitchen or culinary goods . Kate <p> I love this ! I am new to your blog and cant get enough of your fabulous ideas . I made the lavender sea salt scrub yesterday . Easy peasy and smells great ! I filled 5 small mason jars with one recipes and can not wait to give out . Thank you . MC <p> Oh my goodness ! You just made my life a million times easier , ha ha ! I cant sew to save my life , but I 've been wanting to do tea towels for christmas gifts : ) Yay ! ! ! Thank you so much for this idea . Pinning it ! <p> I think the use of a sponge roller to apply the paint is an important point . I cant tell you how many times I 've " goobed " out paint because I tried to get away with just dabbing the stamp in the paint ! <p> Oh so pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , all of your things are beautifulI noticed even your ironing board cover is gorgeous ! Thanks for passing on a great idea so well thought out and clearly explained . <p> These are lovely , Kate . Beautiful colors youve used and yes , they would make a lovely hand made gift . I made some home made jam today for a friends birthday . I might have to make a couple tea towels to go along with the jam . Thank you for sharing your tutorial ! <p> Another great idea and tutorial . Those definitely would make great gifts . I am going to a housewarming party in the near future and rather than wrapping the gift with the usual wrapping paper , I am going to wrap the gift in a monogramed tea towel ! <p> If these are not the typical flour sack towels ( which are very thin and low thread count ) , I was wondering where you found them . I am always on the lookout for heavier flat surface dishtowels for painting . Thanks <p> Hey Rose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 depending on size ) and the paints are $2 each so if you find the one color you love you can stick with that .

Just finished our kitchen reno and my old tea towels are doing it for me anymore . Would love to give this a try.can you advise where you picked up the plain white tea towels for this project ? Many thanks , Karelyn <p> This is just amazing ! I was wondering where you got your white tea towels from , though ? I can not seem to find them . My friend bought me a gorgeous set of stamps a few years ago , and I think making a set of these towels would be perfect ! <p> I 'm wondering about what exactly the printed tea towels can be used for ?

You did a great job and I worship you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well deserved finished product ! <p> What an absolutely beautiful job . We did the oppositechanged our floors all to dark and the stairs for now are still light . You just made me realize I could probably change the stairs at some point . You are very talented . Enjoy your date night . <p> This is gorgeous Kate ! You did such a wonderful job ! I wish we had wood under our carpet , its really bad partical board but we are starting to take the carpet up : ) Did n't  you have wallpaper in the shadow boxes before or am I loosing it ? Love the transformation ! XO Kristin <p> Wow ! I must say you did a fantastic job ! We did the same to our stairs a few years ago , so I know exactly what you went through . Way to go ! Would you mind if I used this in my before/after Friday Post ? <p> They are gorgeous ! Wow , you did an amazing job ! I want to do the same thing w/my staircase , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go to all the effort but I think it might be worth it . Although , it sounds like you put a lot of man hours into it and I would have the same issue blonde wood floors and dark stained steps while I would n't mind it , I 'm not sure how that would do in resale ? <p> Beautiful ! Do n't  do the main floors thoughyoull regret it . I have dark wood floors and a dog and I hate them ( the floors not the dog ) every time I look at them . The dark floor will show every drop of slobber if you have a dog every paw print , every shoe print , every lotiony foot print every speck of dust . They are a pain . <p> Kate they are beautiful ! Love the dark stain . I am loving the molding treatmenthmmm , maybe after my " date night " ( akahigh school football game , Its Homecoming ) , I might be saying " now honey , about those staircase walls . I so want to rip the carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> LOVE LOVE LOVE ! I have natural maple floors ( which I like ) . I always thought I wanted to rip out the carpet and stain the stairs dark , but I could never find any pictures that showed what dark stairs would look like with a light floor . Well , now I know and I LOVE IT ! So pretty . And thanks for sharing all the info . <p> Kate you out did yourself with these stairs ! One question : Will you marry me ? ! Oprah says every wife needs a wife ! I 'll let you do whatever you 'd like to the houseHa ! Again girl , your stairs look fabulous ! Now let me go show my hubby ! <p> Gorgeous ! As I knew it would be . I can not believe you did all this yourself . Wait , yes I can , because you 're marvelous and you take on projects not for the faint of heart . I am so so inspired . I cant even lay eyes on my blond railing right now , I have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well done ! <p> Job well done , my friend ! ! ! I have a question about your Zinsser " Cover Stain . " Do you think that would work well as a primer for the buffet/credenza thing I bought at Salvation Army for my dining room ? It is real wood , and I was n't looking forward to sanding it . : s The can in your picture said " without sanding . " I was thinking of painting it white ? ? Maybe I ought to just send you a photo of it . : s That whole room needs to be redone , and I 'm starting with that piece ! ; ) <p> Wow ! They look amazing . You did a great job . Thank you for sharing tips on product and procedureI appreciate it ! The room would look fab with dark wood floors as well but for now it all looks beautiful . Karen <p> Kate , those stairs came out fantastic ! But you know that ! ! It is what I would love to do to mine . I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So classy . That was a lot of work ! Great job ! <p> Stripping paint from furniture is one of the hardest tasks out there and you managed an entire staircase ! Incredible . The end result is well worth it and the new white paneling makes all of the difference in the world . You have a great eye ! <p> You have inspired me to do my steps ! I so want to do them but my floors are light . You showed me I can do a mix ( and one day I will have them stained dark too ) . I love it and your work is GREAT ! Zizette <p> Kate ! What a labor but what a result ! I love seeing the before and after . Isnt it truly the best compliment when your husband puts up with it all and still loves it ? I love secret plansgirl , you know when the best time to ask for things ismmhhhmmmm . <p> Gorgeous ! Just Gorgeous ! The first thing that comes to mind is the courage you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see when you come in the front door , and it always comes out so perfectly because you keep on working at all the details . A true inspiration and what an incredible transformation ! xo <p> Yay you those are LOVELY ! The house we just bought has nice new hardwoods up the stairs and the entire second floor . They are kind of orangey blonde oak just a couple of weeks ago it dawned on me we could have them sanded and stained . I do n't  see it in the immediate future as there are SO many things higher on the priorty list , but definitely something to look forward to ! <p> Absolutely SUPERB Kate ! And to think that you did this yourself just blows my mind ! I love the new look and the new wall art and light fixture too . So gorgeous . A date night and glass of wine is definitely in order ! <p> I am so impressed ! Staining things and I are not really friends , hopefully one day we can be , but so far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impatient is a better word . I would love to have wood stairs , but one am just too darn clumsy I would slip and I have not convinced the hubby : ) <p> They are gorgeous . It changes the entire look of the house ( or at least the part I can see ) . The molding you added makes it all look so much more expensive . I am trying to imagine the job it will be to do those floors , but I 'm sure you will not only get it doneit will be stunning ! <p> Oh my wordthis is an amazing transformation ! You did a fabulous job . Especially considering it was mostly done at night after the kids were in bed . How did you get up and down the stairs while it was wet ? It has completely changed the look of the house . Lisa <p> SO beautiful . I have already warned my hubby that I want picture frame molding , wood floors and wood on the steps . Like your hubby he likes the carpet . I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ! Thanks for the examples . Awesome work . Lori <p> Fantastic job ! It looks spectacular .. really ! ! ! Thanks so much for sharing thisits very inspiring for people like me who have some pretty nasty carpet on our stairs ! ! Have a great weekend and enjoy the beauty of all your hard work ! Angie xo <p> Hi Kate ! Ive been waiting for this and it was worth the wait . It looks beautiful ! I love the duraseal color and want to do this to my stairs also . Ive been hesitating because I have a cream colored tile in my foyer . Do you think staining the treads the antique walnut color would work with the tile ? I was thinking of ripping the tile out and putting hardwood . That would be quite a project . <p> Congratulations on a fabulous job ! The staircase looks gorgeous . I love the feeling of accomplishment at the end of a long project like this one . For me , just seeing a project completed makes me happy for days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . I 'm sure you 'll be thrilled every time you walk up and down the stairs . Enjoy ! <p> They look wonderful . What a transformation and workout for you . I am in the process of re-doing my steps and I enjoyed reading your husbands view on the steps . Are all guys alike ? Mine thinks the same liked carpet and thinks the steps are noisy now . I just had to remind him has he ever not liked what I have done in the house ? He suprisesd me that other day when I came home from work he had removed the rest of the carpet that I had not gotten to yet . Got ta love him . Hope you had a fabulous date night last night . My best Diane <p> I just love how the steps turned out and have been dying to do this to my own staircase . The problem Im having is I have 2 landings and I 'm pretty sure there is ugly plywood under the carpet . I see that you have a landing too ! Could you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million ! ! <p> I am new to your blog and am absolutely blown away by your staircase transformation . I had been thinking about doing this and you have given me the motivation to move ahead with it ! Now that you have the experience you do with the stairs , would you do the handrail the same way as you did or would you change it up based on what you learned doing the stairs ? ? <p> Just one word AWESOME ! ! ! If I had these stairs I would be lounging around all over them day and night ! ! Thanks so much for sharing the complete process and all the steps it took you to get these beauties the way they look and I love the fact that you showed your " messiness " with the stain on the walls ! ! Now that I have the tools and your how-to-guide Im hoping I can convince my DH to do the same to our stairs ! ! <p> Thanks for this post . I have always wanted to take up the carpet in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bottom floor is a medium colored wood . This looks amazing ? Thank you <p> Kate , you totally inspired me to do my stairs and banister when we moved into our house a year ago . They turned out really great ! You did a really awesome job and i can appreciate all the labor so late at night . I almost fell asleep sanding ! <p> Fantabulous ; ) I do n't  care about my woods matching eitherespecially where the floors go through-out the entire floor as shown in your photoyou know into other rooms , etc . The moulding/chair rail up the wall just makes this " landing " area seem larger and more substancial . You go girl ! <p> So gorgeous ! Youve really got my wheels turning now . My oak floors are quite similar to yours , and I 've been thinking that removing the carpet from our stairs may be the best option ( its ugly ! ) , but I was trying to figure out the best way to make the treads match . Now I see they do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love your posts . You have inspired me so much ! I have gotten a plethora of ideas for my new apartment from your blog . Upon reading your refinishing/staining blog posts I am encourage to transform my china hutch back to its true mahogany beauty . Thank you so much ! ! <p> WOWZA just beautiful . truly a LABOR of LOVE ! I grew up with wood treads , and learned every step by heart . your kids will too . the makeover , including the lovely mouldings and photographs lining the starwell , is just incredibly elegant . Your hub already knows his days are numbered on the floors ! ( He s great , we also know , re ; pics of kitchen painting ) <p> These came out beautiful ! I 'm in total awe of you , your house , your skills ! I think I spent about two hours on your blog after I found it ! We just bought a new house with the MOST FAB double staircase , and I WILL be following your directions and doing the same ! Although ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing it will look . Thank you for this beautiful piece of art that your blog is , you are SO inspiring ! <p> They 're absolutely beautiful , Kate ! Definitely looks like the end result was worth all of the hard work that you put into them . You did a great job . I had to laugh about your date night strategy . Hope that worked out for you . : - ) <p> I am finally rejoining the human race after being sick for nearly a week and just now saw your new stairs . Congrats lady ! These are absolutely beautiful ! You are truly magnificent ; is there no DIY project you ca n't tackle and conquer with flying colors ? ! ? ! Hats off to you , friend ! <p> Kate , your stairs look great , and I even like the contrast btwn the light and dark floors . I would caution you on staining the rest of your floors- I have very dark cherry floors , and wish they were lighter ! Is your house fairly bright with natural light ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your rooms . The dark floors also show everything . Drip some water on the floor , leave it long enough to attract some dust , and it shows as a light spot on the dark floor . Keep up the good work ! <p> Amazing ! ! I 'm hoping to get rid of the carpet on my stairs and put down hardwood too . It is so great getting the play by play to prepare me for our future project . On a somewhat related note , I love the little table there next to the stairs . I would love to see the whole entryway . Is there any chance , if I ask really nicely , we can get a 360 degree view ? Your stairs look so similar to mine , and I 'm a little stuck on the entry and I desperately need some inspiration . I love your blog , you do amazing things . <p> Your stairs looks beautiful . I have the same boring oak staircase with carpet that I dream of doing the same thing to it , but boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time outside the house and with a toddler at home , I just cant find the time to commit to it yet . I have a ( stupid ) question , would it be easier to stain the steps after it is cut to size , then nail them in place ? touch up can be done after , but that way it wo n't take too many late nights . Just curious ! thanks <p> It is so worth all the work do n't  you think ? I live in an 1890 house . We had a carpet runner on painted stairs that had tons of paint . Lead at that ! So in the months before our wedding I pulled up the carpet , then the tact nails , screws that we do n't  know why they were there , staples , stripped the stairs , sanded , sanded more , sanded again then did the stain . I finished my staircase much the same . It made a dramatic difference in our foyer . I love it . I will never live with fully carpet stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railings . <p> It came out SO beautiful ! I hate carpet on stairs and blond oak wood . You must have had a dreadful time looking at that everyday with visions in your mind on how you wanted it to be . Great job though and the fact that you tackled this project yourself speaks high volumes on how hands-on you really are . *Clapping my hands in a circular motion . Bravo ! Bravo ! Job well done ! <p> OK , seriously , I am in AWE ! You have inspired me , we have been wanting to do the same , and now I can not wait to get at it ! I only pray mine turn out as well . You have done an incredible job , THANK YOU so much for sharing the process . <p> Congrats on the newly finished stairs , must feel great . I think I would be camping out on them day and night because they are so pretty .. <p> Oh my ! GORGEOUS ! ! ! ! ! I actually like that the stairs and floors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what you mean about the stairs being louder . I took the carpet off mine when we moved in 2 years ago and our stairs are SO LOUD ! <p> I love your stairs ! Your blog was an inspiration when I painted my handrail and spindles this summer . Now I 'm noodling over what to do with the carpet on my stairs What kind of flooring do you have at the top of the stairs ? Is it hardwood also ? <p> What do you plan to do about dings on the white risers ? I have white risers and two kids , and I have a hard time keeping them from looking banged up and dirty as every shoe seems to leave a scuff mark . In fact , I am thinking about installing a carpet runner just to cut down on noise and dings . Any suggestions ? <p> Floored by this floor ! I have almost this exact same staircase scenario , and the same blonde wood floors . I considered painting the rail white because the light rail seems dated , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me the different colors would look great , I would n't have believed themThis is gorgeous ! I , too , have young children with draggy , jumpy feet ( not to mention a medium-sized dog with sadly neglected nails ) : I 've been told by some that the dark stain shows every scratch and every speck of dustHow does the dark finish hold up ? <p> This is beautiful ! What color is your wall colorit looks like its the same in the foyer as in your dining room . I love your dining room . I would love to know where you got your paint and what color you chose . Thanks ! <p> First of all , what a fresh breath of air these photos are . This is such an amazing transformation ! I know personally what kind of work you had to go to finishing it . I have n't posted on my blog our staircase redo , but it sure was months of work . <p> so i loved your stairs so much i went out and got the duraseal stain . how did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and let it dry that way ? after i wipe the stain it becomes lighter than the minwax dark walnut stain i have . granted I have red oak and not blonde oak , i cant imagine it making that huge of a difference . <p> I lovve your staircase ! I 'm trying to get my unhandy husband to do fake waincoting going up our stairs . Hopefully I can convince him he can learn as he goes ! I love your wall sconces . Can you tell me where you got them ? Thanks so much <p> Youve inspired mehowever working with stain and polyurethane in the humidity of June and July is not something I 'd recommend in my neck of the woods . Anyhow , I striped , stained , retreaded , striped , stainedagain , and applied 3 coats of poly . My mocha brown hardwood steps are b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l ! The QUESTION : Now , how long do I need to wait to use the white primer on the risers ? I am scared that taping the paper onto the steps will take off the poly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for my sanity and that of my family ) and I cant seem to find help in Internet land . Can you please advise me ? Again , thanks for your inspiration- you 're work is beautiful ! <p> I love the work you did ! I have been hesitant to attempt painting and staining my stairwell.until I read your blog . After reading what you had done I started painted my stairwell bainster spindles and went and got the Minwax polyshades in Antique Walnut . 2 coats of white on the spindles and one coat of the stain/poly mix on the railings , platforms and main posts . So far , looking really good ! Our stairs are carpet ( for now ) but the foyer has hardwood , I 'll be starting that this weekend ! Thanks for the inspiration ! ! ! <p> This is just what I want to do to our stairs . I 'm curious how it is holding up over time ? And if you still like it as much as when you first did them ? Do you have to sweep them everyday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had done different ? <p> And thanks for all the inspiring stuff you always share . My house is going to be so much more beautiful because of you . <p> Hey Elesa , the staircase is holdin gup great , absolutely no regrets ! Yes , I still love them as much as when I first finished them , definitely an improvement on what was there before . I sweep them about twice a week , more like wipe them down only when necessary . Dark floors do show more dust . <p> I 'm another person who youve inspired with your tutorial . I 'm finishing a kitchen project and then its on .. me vs . The stairs . I have the same setup you started with and cant stand to look at it anymore . I love the color you ended up and am even going to try the craft paint trick . Thank you so much for the inspiration and the tutorial . <p> Actually , you inspired me and my wife , we 'd like to do almost the same as you . Our only concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Can you send us a picture . Because the fact that the stair do n't  match the floor , we think its beautiful , but which color is your nose a the top of the stair ? <p> Hi Mike , we have cream colored carpet at the top of our stairs , and natural wood floors at the bottom . I go back and forth whether to stain the downstairs floors dark , but I confess the natural wood is much better at hiding debris , the dark shows everything . So while I like the look of the dark , for a family with kids , the light is more practical . <p> I was wondering if you ended up staining your floors . My staircase looks almost identical and I love this look . I have oak coloured hardwood floors right through though and am worried how the dark stained staircase will look as I have no intention of changing the flooring throughout but need to modernize to my style a bit . Thanks . I love it . <p> Hi Catherine , still havent changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two different tones of wood , but Ive grown to like it ! Lighter floors hide more dirt/dust and with little kids , I 'll take all the help I can get ! : ) Kate <p> Ive been researching stains and have vowed to use Minwax since it obviously superior however I am having the same issue with not being able to find the perfect color just as you mentioned in this blog post . The Duraseal in Antique Brown appears to be the perfect color from what I can see here . We are re-staing our very light wood kitchen cabinetry and we are looking for a dark/rich/chocolate color/kind of modern-sh . What would you think of using that product for the kitchen cabinets ? Any extra tips/tricks/suggestions would be super-duper ! ! ! ! Thanks ! <p> W.O.W . Yes , I am in love with your staircase wood redo as well . Heavens to Betsie , girl ! I must say you have more guts than I could poke a stick at ! I 'm right there with you on having a hesitant DH since I pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though , our stairs are already wood which takes a couple steps off of your plan , its still a big undertaking . Our floors are the 80s honey oak , yes .. lovely . Oh , and do n't  get jealous now .. we have a mondo matching oak fireplace mantle ! I know .. take a breather . The rest of our house said bye bye to the 80s a very long time ago so I say its time for me to cut the Aquanet aresol cord and bring our staircase up to par . Seeing your results gives me much hope I can swing it . And I think that mantle is screaming for the same redo as well . <p> I was wondering if I could get your opinion on using the Duraseal on cabinetry ? We are about to re-stain our very light wood cabinets and I 'm struggling to find a good color . Since the product is for floors I was n't sure if it was a good idea ? Thanks ! <p> Your stairs look great . I see you finished the bannister first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bannister , you used minwax dark walnut and then added the craft glaze to help remove the graininess . Question , instead of doing this , would you recommend just using two coats of the dura seal and finishing with the polyurethane as you did with the stairs ? <p> How long did you wait after polying the stairs to put down the tape ? My husband and I are currently tackling this project , and I 'm not sure how long to let the stairs cure after he applies the poly . Thanks ! : ) <p> I am redoing my stairs ! I Love this look . I have used a dutch oil on the stairs to the basement and they are greatnot slippery . i wonder how the duraseal and poly compares to that . I have lots of kids and wondered how your stairs are for sock feet ? Are they slick ? Thanks ! <p> Hello Kate I 'm wondering what color white paint you used for trim and risers and what finish eg.egshell , semi gloss ? did you put the poly on the risers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on only the stained area or use it as a primer for all white areas ? what angle did you cut the risers at ? <p> Hi Ashley , I color matched the white , cant recall which one but it was eggshell on the risers . No poly on the risers , just the treads ( the wood ) the risers were pre-primed so as I recall I only primed the parts where the stain got on them . Not sure what you mean by " what angle " for the risers pretty sure those were straight right angle cuts but measured precisely for each one no wall ( or tread ) is ever perfect so we measured them and cut them individually . : ) Still looks amazing ! Kate <p> You are so talented and brave ! Question , now that you have had your staircase finished for a year and a halfhow has is held up ? Has it become dull or scratched ? If not , is that because you do not wear shoes in your home ? I have 4 kids and we wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would destroy ours . <p> Also , how did you install the hardwood on the landing ( not the top of the stairs , but the landing where the stairs turn to the left at the 10th step ) Did you just butt some boards up to each other ? <p> Hi Tracey , our staircase looks just as great after all this time , no scratches or anything , shoes and all ! Those extra coats of poly help but note it can get slippery with socks but my little ones are " trained " to go slow and/or hold onto the rail and we have n't had any accidents . On the landing we installed regular hardwood flooring with a specialty edge to match the rounded steps ordered through our hardwood installer , just like with the bottom step . Kate <p> Beautiful work ! I 'm in the process of finishing my stairs but I 'm at a loss when it Comes to the landing . I have a landing 2 steps from the bottom , and I see you have one in the middle . What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been eying your wonderful foyer and reading your tutorial . My husband has agreed to let me try this on our stairs ! Although , he has a concern and has been resistant . Are your stairs more hazardous ( slippery ) with the wood instead of the carpet ? We have three teenagers and they run up and down the stairs regardless of our attempts to stop them . And we all run around the house bare foot . He is concerned that the wood finish might be more slick ( and therefore hazardous ) than the carpet . What has your experience been ? Thank you sop much for your tutorial . If you would like , I will send you my results when I finish ! <p> Hi Cindy I have two small kids ( 6 and 8 ) and its not slippery with bare feet but with socks yes , so they just know to hang on to the handrail when going up and down in fast motion ! No accidents to date and its been a couple of years <p> Hi Kate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful blog but I do follow it . My questions is , I did my stairs exactly as you detailed above in your article but after a few days the poly and the stain started peeling off .. I put on two coats of poly and two coats of stain . After all my hard work , it now has to be redone because the stairs look awful again . Ideas/suggestions ? I 'm open . Please . Best , Jackie <p> Beautiful ! ! We are using Duraseal Ebony and for some reason your floors look darker than ours , despite Antique Brown being a lighter shade of stain . We want a VERY dark finish . Our floor guys are using rags to soak up every drop of excess stain after they apply the stain to the floor . When you did your stairs , did you apply a thin layer and leave it to dry , or did you wipe off all excess stain ? I 'm just trying to figure out how you got such a rich dark color , I 'd like to use the same technique ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain . I 'd love to hear your thoughts . We had to re-sand due to them using the wrong color in the first place , now they have one coat of ebony down on popped wood and its still not dark enough I 'm open to any suggestions at all for the second coat application . Thanks so much great photos ! ! ! <p> Hey there ! I 'm obsessed with your stairs- your entire staircase is identical to mine ! I even have the light oak wood floors that I plan on keeping that color- So , needless to say you 've given me hope . We just ripped up our hideous blue runner , and were left with ugly nail holes and light oak treads . I 'm thinking of tackling the project- however I 'm curious how you put the stain around the railing bars at the bottom- it just seems so likely the stain will hit the poles . did you tape them ? <p> Hi !

One of the two navy blue glass lamps I had up in my studio got knocked over and ( insert sad emoji ) shattered on the back side . I loved these lamps so much , the shape , the matte finish , the lucite bases . That combination made them the favorites in my home . I still have one but I believe bedside lamps look best when they match especially when the nightstands are different . So I went looking for a pair of new ones to replace them . <p> Now that the new floors are in , I 'm planning on doing a little redecorating in anticipation of renting the space out on the weekend to wine country visitors . I have n't found the perfect replacement yet , but this one is a close contender . <p> - <p> Like a throw pillow , colorful table lamps are an eye-catching way to add a dash of color to a console , side table , or nightstand. 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057835 @3257835/ <h> My Bamboo is Peacock Blue <p> By Kate Riley July 13 , 2011 <p> I have to say thank you to all of you for your suggestions on what color to paint the faux bamboo chest I scored last weekend while out thrifting . Quite frankly , it 's one of those pieces that would look really good in any color , but there were a few comments that coaxed me toward peacock blue . <p> Ooh , rich bluey-turquoise . . . <p> Make the gold hardware pop , yes that 's a must ! <p> Yes , me likey colors of the ocean , thanks for reading my mind Andrea . <p> Amen sister , peacock is da bomb . <p> So I busted out of my just paint my furniture white ' box I fit so nicely into , and pulled off a bold shade of glossy peacock blue . You saw the faux bamboo chest a few days ago that I dragged home from a thrift store . <p> Check out this hottie now : <p> Now that 's what I 'm talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From the start , this find required some minor repairs . First , there was the chipping veneer around the top that I peeled off , then patched with some wood filler . <p> Next came the broken leg , with a piece of bamboo falling off . Some wood glue and something heavy on top ( two cans of primer ) while the glue dried saved the day . <p> Now it looks like something you 'd pay top dollar for on 1st Dibs ( double fist bump to the chest , followed up by peace sign to the crowd ) : <p> The genie lamp was also a Pier One find , on sale and very pretty in brushed nickel , but given a coat of gold leaf spray paint , it plays off those awesome campaign pulls . <p> Bowl from Marshalls ( $3 dolla , holla ! ) , the vintage framed partridge bird patches also found thrifting last weekend , funny how they fit right in , I LOVE them . That vase was on a clearance rack at Michaels for $5 bucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced under $10 I just had to have it . Collecting simple white modern ceramics in all sizes is an addiction of mine because they 're just so darn versatile and look good anywhere from tabletop to bookcase to mantel . Those fat jungle leaf clippings are from my royal empress tree in my backyard , yo . <p> After all these years of teaching myself how to refinish furniture and working with all sorts of paints and products , I still believe if you choose to spray paint a piece of furniture , you can achieve a really nice look if you follow certain steps . <p> Here are the ones I followed for this faux bamboo chest : <p> Remove all hardware and/or hinges . 1 ) Clean off any debris , fill holes and make repairs ( mentioned above , and here ) ; then coat your furniture with a bonding primer ; 2 ) when dry , lightly sand with a fine grit sanding wedge to remove any drips or residue ; 3 ) wipe down any dust with a cloth ; 4 ) freshen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by Krylon ) ; 5 ) apply two light coats of paint with two cans of Rust-Oleum spray paint in Night Tide ' gloss allowing to dry in between coats 6 ) when dry , wipe down any residue with cloth ; 7 ) apply protective coat to seal and protect . <p> Tip #1 : when spray painting furniture , especially drawer or door fronts , it is best to apply the spray paint when the surface of the door or drawer is facing up , meaning do n't paint where it naturally sits in place . Remove the drawer or door and and lay it down on a painter 's tarp so that the surface you 're about to paint is facing the sky . I find that makes for more even application and reduces the potential for drips . <p> Tip #2 : often with spray paint , along long surfaces especially on furniture you will see a splotchy finish , which I mentioned in this article about spray paint FAQs . This is frustrating because in any light , the color is even , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this , which is why I often turn to a safe bet : painting a piece with a roller/brush combo and latex paint . However , there is an appeal to knocking out a quick paint job on a small piece of furniture with a few cans of spray paint , so I 've been experimenting to get rid of the potential for a splotchy finish . I think I found the solution . <p> The best way to get rid of a splotchy surface that results along long flat surfaces from spray paint is to coat it with one of these protective brush-on formulas with a cheapo sponge brush . Either one works great ( Varathane or Minwax Polycrylic ) . They are both water based , and they can both be applied to fully cured oil based completely dry spray painted surfaces . <p> Do n't worry that they look milky in the can , they always dry clear . Choose satin or gloss depending on your preference , and be sure to work with them when the temperature is between 60 and 75 degrees because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To appease both myself and my friend JJ , I chose a gloss finish : <p> And that , my friends , is how this funky faux bamboo chest . . . <p> . . . turned into this fabulous accent piece . <p> K8 I hope I 've convinced you : <p> I spent $25 on this chest , and $8 bucks on spray paint . By the way , Rust-Oleum 's Night Tide is the perfect shade of peacock blue , I 've used it here and here in the past and I find it at Lowe 's and Orchard Supply Hardware , but all stores vary their selection . <p> The rest of the supplies I had on hand , so this is a $33 dollar investment for me and I could n't be more thrilled ! What I mostly love is the statement in now makes in the guest room . Lesson learned : as tempting and lovely as it is , do n't always play it safe with white , black or gray . Every room needs a pop of color so why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all push ourselves to embrace bold colors to bring personality to our spaces . <p> Now it 's your turn , so go on . Paint something blue or pink or green or yellow or red . It will make you feel really really good . <p> Bowing down to you ! ! ! This piece turned out beautiful , Kate !

It is an old inexpensive set that can seat about 4 ( I have 5 chairs though ) that my parents gave to me . I have never painted furniture before . Do you think it would be wise of me to start with something smaller ? I 'm also unsure of what steps would be necessary to paint the very glossy surface of the table ( and make it food safe ) . I 'm fairly certain its just a thick layer of gloss but it seriously looks like plastic its so thick . <p> The current light-to-medium yellowy wood color they are right now clashes with my wood floor and is just not appealing to me at all .

The blue looks so beautiful with the glam gold handles , like a pricey piece of furniture ! Questiondid you replace the veneer with another strip of new veneer ? How did you use the wood filler ? <p> Hey Jess , I linked to the window panels in the post , look for it towards the top ! <p> RKLewis and Angela : the pulls were already gold , or shiny brass . I removed them first , then took them apart , cleaned them and gave them a light dusting of the Gold Leaf spray paint . Once dry , I put them back together and reattached them to the painted piece . : ) <p> Debbie , I did not replace the veneer , it peeled off pretty easily and underneath was just wood that I sanded . Some spots needed filling , but overall , the sanding down to the wood was all it took ! <p> Whoa , whoa , whoa , what a beauty ! I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but seriously , this is awesome . I LOVE the color , it goes so well with the gold . I 'm feeling really inspired now ! Xo , Katie <p> Gorgeous !

Any ideas ? <p> Also , would love to see your list of favorite places to shop for bedding ! <p> But what if you need a bigger " room sized " rug and not just an accent rug ? This was the case for us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . You can order Martha Stewart carpet ( through Home Depot ) cut to your custom size and have the edges bound into a rug . We were able to get a 10.5 x10.5 foot rug for our dining room and a 16 x 13.5 foot rug for our living room for a steal compared to other ( not nearly big enough ) extra large rugs . Bonus , it comes with stain and wear protection . <p> I just purchased an 8+10 area rug for my living room . I almost special ordered it from Home Depot , which I thought was the best price , but was put off that they would charge me a restocking fee if I did n't  purchase it sight unseen . Well , I did purchase the rug , sight unseen , from Overstock.com for over $60 less than HDs price ( plus no tax and free shipping ) . Very happy with my purchase . I think I should invest in a rug pad though . They say it extends the life of the carpet . <p> I also like Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes . I like to change things out fairly often , and I found I can usually get a great deal from them . I also LOVE their pillow selection ! <p> Pottery Barn , Overstock , and Joss &amp; Main are my go-tos ! I 'm surprised Pottery Barn is n't on this list because they have a lot of rugs in the $500 category which really is n't that bad compared to a lot of other places . I just did a mood board with a couple of rug options for the " thrify shopper " ! <p> I pined this page so I can refer to it when I need rugs but I could n't fine a pin button on your great post of " Favorite online retail stores " That is another post I will want to refer to in the future <p> We use one of Dash and Alberts indoor/outdoor rugs for our bathmat . I was n't sure it would work , but we love it . The one thing I would n't do again is buy a rug with white in it . Easy to clean , yes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it ) , but still shows dirt quickly . <p> I know this is an old post but can someone suggest a brand of indoor/outdoor rug that is n't scratchy ? I love the cleanability factor but afraid that it will be too uncomfortable for a baby to crawl around on . With online stores I obviously cant go feeling them all first and retuning a rug seems like it would be such a pain and also expensive to ship back. ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057842 @3257842/ <h> Chalk Paint Mirror <p> By Kate Riley May 24 , 2011 <p> Yep . I gone and done it . Two weeks ago , I clicked the Buy It Now ' button and ordered some of Annie Sloan 's Chalk Paint . I had read such rave reviews , I just could n't take it anymore , I had to try it for myself . So I did . <p> Two days ago , my shipment arrived . <p> If the French distressed look is what you 're going for . . this paint will do the trick . <p> This is Paris Grey ' . It 's quite lovely . <p> I mentioned awhile back I had a thrift store mirror sitting in my garage . I loved its shape , especially the arched cathedral top . Since I planned to have it sit in the foyer , I did n't want it to be dark wood because the dresser below is already a dark stain . I saw the mirror above it in a complementary distressed paint treatment . <p> Like this : <p> I paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for the Annie Sloan Chalk Paint experiment . <p> My review , thus far : <p> What I love : This paint is very easy to use , it 's water based , has no odor , and has a nice consistency for flat paint . I was able to cover my mirror 's frame in just one coat . This paint goes on very quickly , I painted this mirror in ten minutes , which is a heck of a lot quicker than my traditional method ( primer + latex paint ) . The chalk paint cleans up with water and a little goes a long way . According to the company , there is no primer required and the paint will stick to varnished furniture or melamine surfaces . <p> There is little open time since this paint dries very fast . I noticed that with a brush , there were visible strokes when wet due to the quick drying time , but when the paint dried they virtually disappeared . The paint dries very quickly ( in about 20 minutes ) , and has a chalky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress with a sanding wedge , the paint comes off in tiny dust particles . <p> What concerns me : This paint is very expensive : one quart cost me $39 from my closest California retailer House of Anne . ( $51 total with shipping , ouch . ) That is one pricey quart of paint . Not gallon . Quart . Also , what is it about this paint that allows one to skip the primer step ? What is the special additive ? I could n't find the answer on the Annie Sloan website or anywhere on the internet , so I wrote to them . <p> I 'm always concerned about durability , you can read Annie 's answers to my inquiries in our Q&amp;A . I 'm still curious about the formula , and want to know what exactly distinguishes this paint from all the other water based paints which allows one to skip the primer step . Annie is keeping her ingredients a secret . <p> Also , this paint is available in only 24 colors , which you can mix to create your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quick . <p> To finish off my mirror , I gave it one coat of clear paste wax ( Johnson 's ) which slightly deepened the color . I did not purchase the waxes from House of Anne , they are an additional $25 for each wax ( clear or dark ) . However , the chalk paint + Johnson 's paste wax combo looks really great up on the wood mirror , and I can say I will certainly use this paint again ( after all , I have most of my quart left ! ) There 's a dresser revamp I have in mind , and this Paris Gray ' will be perfect for it . I do want to see how it performs over a long flat surface that gets a lot of wear and tear . <p> My first impression is a good one thus far . This Paris Grey ' chalk paint looks aged when dry and distresses exceptionally well . <p> Bottom line : If you can stomach the cost of one quart , then I encourage you to try if for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm loving the result so far . If you love a flat finish and a European distressed patina , then this paint will give you the look you 're going for . <p> hi Kate -Firstly I can not believe you got that mirror for $16 . WOW that 's fantastic . and i love how you painted it . we cant get annie sloan paint in australia but i 'm dying to try it . actually tempted to make my own chalk gesso paint . I 'll let you know how i get on . Am really keen to see how your other followers comment about the durability of this paint . i 'm always a stickler for priming . cheers Fiona from LilyfieldLife <p> Kate , I have n't used the paint but for a paint to adhere without a primer , it has to have some kind of bonding agent like a bonding primer . A bonding primer is different than a general all purpose primer . It just bites onto the surface and wo n't move . <p> A good ceiling paint has similar properties . I 'm able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest try that route next on a test piece of wood without primer . It also leaves a chalky finish so it may offer you a similar outcome for a fraction of the price . I use it on lots of wood projects . BUT it adheres so well its pretty tough to distress . : ) <p> The more I read this piece , the more that paint sounded just like typical German wall paint . Germans do n't  do latex ( for what reasons I ca n't be sure , but its definitely in the minority here , as is oil-based paint ) . My experience with German paint is that its also super chalky , does n't  need a primer , dries extremely fast , and is easy to rub off . <p> My experience w/German paint is that it sucks for the long haul . On something like a mirror , fine , but I would never paint furniture or walls with the stuff . I 've actually seen it flake off walls when bumped ( small flakes , but still ) . <p> My overall impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint with a massive price tag . A PPs comment about the ceiling paint certainly adds to my suspicions . I think somebodys making money hand over fist on this one . <p> Hi Kate , The paint sounds like it defeats the purpose of buying cheap and refinishing at $39 a quart ! I like the idea of the ceiling white Im going to try that . In any event , I love the mirror ! It is such a beautiful shape and the paint job looks beautiful ! Susan @ homeroad.net <p> So , I have done a few pieces in the Annie Sloan paint . I have just placed my second order , mainly because I ran out in the middle of a large 4 poster bed project . Ouch . The cost is ridiculous . In fact , the cost angers me , but I decided to try it based on one person recommendations , Marian Parsons ( aka Miss Mustard Seed . ) <p> The paint is like velvet and the finish is breathtaking , but it is the dustiest paint ever ! You HAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when sanding . It is a bear to get off for distressing purposes after the second coat . I have used a few different waxes , the Fiddles and Sons giving me the nicest results . <p> I would not use this on a piece of furniture that I felt was going to see a lot of wear and tear . But , I will say that if I was going to put this paint on the top of a dresser , I would probably seal it in the very least with three coats of a wipe on polly in a matt finish . I mean , come on gals , we do this with latex paint too ! <p> Regardless , I am holding my breath waiting to hear the ACTUAL results from everyone out in blog land as we continue down this road . I have my suspicions too . Remember something also , the reason that the paint is so expensive has a lot to do with the US currency rates . The dollar is weak internationally and that makes a huge difference in the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pint would cost me 16 English Pounds . Just my two cents. : ) <p> Hey ! I just tried it for the first time myself this last week . I agree with all the pros you pointed out but the price tag is PAINFUL ! I paid $89 for 2 quarts with shipping . I blew threw one already painting a big piece of furniture already . Its fun but I do n't  know how much more , if any , I 'll buy at those prices . My thrifty heart ca n't take it ! Your mirror is beautiful , btw ! JenT <p> Beautiful mirror . I bought a quart of old white and was suprised that it was a quart . I read wrong when ordering . I am not a furniture painter , by any means , I thought it was OK . I liked the finish it left after sanding . I had some major brush strokes showing . I was n't going to distress as much as I ended up having to , because of the brush strokes . I have a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I get better at it . <p> The mirror is beautiful ! But the price of the paint is just too much for me . I 'm glad Donna from FJI mentioned ceiling paint- I would have never thought of that and will probably try it first ! I wonder if ceiling paint can be tinted- would the tint formulas work right ? <p> Love getting the scoop on this I might spring for a quart for a project or two , but would be hard pressed to justify using a lot of it . I do love the look and the mirror looks wonderful in contrast to the chest in your foyer . Thanks , Kate , for the low down ! <p> I 've never heard of chalk paint before , but my guess is that its a water-based type primer with chalk added . Or maybe plaster . And pigment . When I Googled what chalk was made of , I learned that " Chalk is primarily calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) or magnesium carbonate ( MgCO3 ) . " I know that Annie Sloans information about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sure would be fun to monkey around with some cheapo ingredients here and see what we all could come up with ! <p> I have n't tried the chaulk paint . I tint the water based Zinnser primer with paint tints and use it as the base and the finish coat . It dries fast and looks the same as chaulk paint for a whole lot less . Your mirror is gorgeous ! Great find at a great price . Love that ! <p> I really liked Juliettes post and I am going to give the ceiling paint a try since I already have that . Your mirror looks very nice and I think I will try it on a vintage mirror that my neighbour gave to me . <p> I just read Wendys post , I will have to try that as well . I certainly have a lot of chalk dust around with a 9 year-old : - ) <p> Wow Kate , you really got me wondering now ! I was going to " save up " and purchase some ( ha ! ) , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am glad that you are questioning the paint a little . That way others can think more about something themselves . hmmmvery interesting . I 'm going to come back and see what other commenters have said <p> Oh and before I forget , That mirror is the BOMB , girl ! ! ! For 16 bucks ? ? ? Look at it nowWowza ! ! ! <p> I have n't tried this pain but your project makes me want to . I never find goodies like this in my area ot is it that I do n't  quite have the vision you do to see to make the miracles you do . I love this piece and can not wait to get DIYing . <p> I will try ceiling paint before paying for this chalk paint . I also looked up //www.milkpaint.com after seeing it on Martha yesterday painting terracotta pots .. This one comes in powder form and you mix with water .. cheaper also and wondering if this is worth trying . <p> Hmmm I have never played around with chalk paint and while it does look beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wince when paint is 10 dollars a quart . Also , I love the Paris Gray color , I believe it was Real Simple a couple of months ago did a piece on grays , and they had this beautiful room painted all gray and the designer swore this was the gray every Paris apartment was painted and it looked gorgeous much like your mirror ! <p> Oh , I use it all the time . You can see some of the projects on my blog . I think its wonderful and I plan on using it again . You did a wonderful job ! Its a beautiful mirror and the amount of distressing is perfect ! Thank you for sharing XOXO Laura at bandbnest.blogspot.com <p> Love , love , love it ! I tend to work with a somewhat limited color palette , so only owning 3-4 quarts of this stuff goes a long way for me depending on the size of the pieces I 'm working on . The biggest thing for me is that Chalk Paint actually makes me WANT to paint . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you think about the time and money you save by skipping those steps the higher price tag seems much more reasonable time is money ! Now its just me and my brush and of course a few sanding blocks , but I 'm really enjoying it . Oh , and I cant forget , your mirror turned out FABULOUS Kate ! <p> I 'm waiting for my shipment right now . It should have been here yesterdayhopefully today . I bought two colors and the dark and clear wax and a wax brush and the book . All I know is before I blinked I was up at $200 . Not telling my husband that part . Hope this stuff is as good as it seems . <p> i have used it and love it ! it seems to me that it gets harder and more durable over time meaning if its been on a piece a while it will stay there . i love the fact that i can skip steps , but the price is definitely scary ! but you are n't  paying for primer , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , that over time you will probably go through less brushes . i just do n't  like the limitations of color families , and sometimes i crave glossy moderns , which you cant really use this for . your mirror looks fabulous ! i had n't  yet tried the paris gray , but its on my list ! : ) <p> The mirror looks great ! I 've never used the Annie Sloan chalk paint , but I subscribe to Miss Mustard Seed ( **31;1210;TOOLONG ) , and she uses it a lot ! She seems to have nothing but great things to say about it . <p> Kate , I 'm so glad you tried this out . Ive been reading about it but havent tried it . Ive been worried about durability . I 'll come back again later today to read the additional comments that are left on this posts . I 'd love to know how it holds up on a piece that gets a lot of use , like a chest where drawers are being opened and closed . Perhaps the wax helps seal it . Its price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it might be worth it if a quart goes a fairly long way . <p> I just finished painting a mirror last week with Annies chalk paint and really loved the results . I too used Paris Grey . I decided to use a glaze and then a wax . Your expereince was very similar to mine in that it only took one coat to cover and once the paint dried there were virtually no brush marks . <p> Hi Kate , I too just purchased Annies paint . I am painting my dining room table and chairs . So far , so good . I have used just a tiny bit on 2 chairs and the entire base of the table . I have 2 more chairs to go and know I will need to do a second coat . It does try very fast . I wonder if we could just buy Rustoleum chalk board paint . They sell a tint base one so you can choose any color you want ; ) also I came across a company named Hudson that also sells colored chalk paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs is $24 per quart . I am going to try the Rustoleum brand on a end table soon . <p> Hi Kate , First off , gorgeous mirror , and love the result with the Paris Grey ! Secondly , good for you for giving your honest opinion on Chalk paint , and not just automatically jumping on the " Chalk Paint is the best creation ever " bandwagon . I have not tried it , and maybe it is a fantastic product , but I was impressed that you expressed your concerns as well as what you like about it . If given the chance , I probably will try it for myself , but I 'll also be anxious to see how you find the durability of this product is = ) <p> Yes , love the mirror . I bought the paint about 3 weeks ago and have not used yet . I also bought the waxes in clear and dark and have used these . I do love how easy the waxes are to apply and love how " easy " it is to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also love them . I agree the price is really high , its the reason I have n't used yet . I have 3 quarts and " stalling " to use since they are so expensive . Thanks for the honest post . <p> Your mirror is gorgeous ! The size , shape , and details the white distressing really works well on the piece . That was one great find . I have not used chalk paint yet , but have used Kilz original primer as a base and top coat . It is oil based , but is fully dry in 30 minutes and hides everything for about $10 a quart . It holds up extremely well and does distress . I use it on everything I paint , but found that I liked the look of it without paint on top on some pieces . Never thought about the ceiling paint that Donna mentioned , but that is an exciting alternative . My best-Diane <p> That is pricey paint , but if you look at your total investment for that stunning mirror is $70then its pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Belgium last month , I picked up 3 teeny-tiny 2 ? pots of sample paint from Farrow &amp; Ball ( what kind of diy blogger would i be if i did n't  pop in there ? ! ) to the tune of 25 EURO ! ! ! so , about $40 ? And no , there 's no gold flecks or hip slimming agents in it ! <p> I have used it , and I love it ! But I also think it is crazy expensive ! ! ! ! It is super durable after waxing I have done 2 dressers and a buffet . The wax seals it and makes it almost like a poly but with a more natural looking finish.but the wax is also CRAZY expensive ! <p> I love , love , love how your mirror turned out ! What a great product . I 'm not sure I need a full quart for a project , but maybe I can convince a friend ( or two ) to split the cost and have a little DIY party . Thanks for sharing your review of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great find . Ive been reading about the paint around the blogosphere but that price is over the top . I like Donnas suggestion of the ceiling paint . Great tip . The French gray is a color that I cant get enough of right now . <p> First and foremost can I say CENTSATIONAL site ! ! ! ( Sorry , just had to do it ) Second , love the mirror and the paint.youve peaked my curiosity , researcher at heart now I have to find the answer to your questions . while I only have a minute this morning , I did find this cool site . <p> Chalk paint has been around for years and I think , could be wrong , it was the main paint in the 30s , 40s and 50s.I remember seeing recipes for this type of paint , but I think they used lye in it . I 'm sure its the chalk that makes it dry so quickly . <p> None the less , love it , love your style , girl after my own heart . If I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the look so much and considering the price tag and the fact that I 'm a DIY kind of girl I want to find a recipe to make myself . I know there has to be one out there ! <p> Thnaks for reviewing the paint . I 've had my eye on it since I found it at a faux finish institute in Brandon , MS close to where I live . Has anyone else tried what Shannon said " water based Zinnser primer with paint tints " as a substite ? Thinking of doing this or the ceiling paint . <p> Hey Kate .. I also jumped on the band wagon for the chalk paint . Got three colors ! I am very pleased with them . I mentioned my personal pros and cons on my *new* blog . <p> Another Pro that I forgot to mention is that it does go a long way and so far in my experience , once waxed it is pretty durable . I did a side table , in Provence , that gets lots of use and the top is holding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so hard to do with regular paint , but Chalk paint worked awesome ( I was the one on FB that asked about spray painting over latex , OK if you do n't  remember : ) <p> Biggest con of course is the price but other than that I am a huge fan . Limited colors as well but the ones Annie Sloan did create are great . I got Paris Grey , Old White , and Provence . I figured any combination of the three of these will get me where I want to be , considering the colors I am loving at the moment . <p> I buy pieces used and choose to refinish them because I cant always afford to purchase what I need brand new . Does n't  the cost of this paint defeat the purpose totally ? I mean , I 'm a serious bargain hunter and I can not justify spending that amount of money on paint . I also do not want everything in my house matchy-matchy and feel I would spend a fortune on different paint colors . I looked into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have a stroke . <p> I hate using latex paint on furniture because I hate the peeling look when I try to distress . Why has n't  any company come out with paint that is strictly for furniture ? ? OR am I missing it ? I would love to try the Annie Sloan paint , but its just not in my budget , with food and all ! : ) <p> I 'm definitely going to look into tinting ceiling paint and will be doing more research on other chalk paint and different types after seeing other comments . <p> Also , Kate , I 'm so relieved that you gave an honest review and actually paid for the paint , and not a review because you were given the paint . I feel like some of the reviews are not as honest because they are being given free paint in return for advertisement . Bummer . <p> so tempted to hit the buy button myselfam redoing a $25 dining room table and think that old white would be fab on the bottom half .. just have not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wax .. anyone know ? ? thanks for posting ! <p> Love how it turned out ! I wish I could get some paint but I ca n't stomach paying that much for it . Are there samples ? There is a little hype working for sure but other manufacturers will get on the bandwagon and prices should reflect . <p> You did a goregous job as usual Kate , but can this look be acheived with less cash ? My thrifty soul would shake at a $51.00 ( with shipping ) can of paint to redo a thirft store find . You find THE most awesome things in thrift stores . <p> This looks fantastic .. and just out of curiosity has anyone tried to use on a non wood item ? I have a tv stand that is from Target ( craigslist find ) I was thinking about spray painting .. but this looks so pretty and I could tie it in to some of my other pieces . Maybe it would need a primer ? <p> I feel so behind the time with not having tried this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your concerns because I have some of the same ones . But , I am so close to buying some ! Ah ! Decisions I wonder if it would hold up on bathroom cabinets . <p> Just started a new project with the paint and I 'm going to try a two tone distress look with it . The piece I painted last night was done in old white and I was pleased again with the lack of brush lines when dry . It is super expensive and I too worry about no primer especially on pieces with stains . Look forward to the answer . I also bought the recommended hinnants wax and that was my favorite of all . I 've never been a fan of waxed finishes on my furniture but this wax is soft , easy to work with , and leaves a great finish . Check out my post on chalk paint and see my two projects . Love the mirror , Paris grey is a nice color ! <p> Hey Denise , you think like me ! I would love to find a less expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good place to start . Its hard to justify such a big expense on a small amount of paint , but I think this paint goes a little farther than most , I barely put a dent in my quart . Will report back with future experiences . <p> I have been very intrigued with this paint and wanting to give it a try . I have not jumped in yet because of the higher price . Your mirror looks beautiful , Kate , and perfect for your entry . I love the finish of the chalk paint . I appreciate your post and you sharing your experience with it . <p> Thanks for the honest post . This is the first one I 've read that has raised questions or expressed any doubts . Glad to hear it still seems amazing . I really want to try it and am waiting for a piece that I love enough to spend that much on painting . I willone of these days . <p> I ordered one of Annies books last week ( havent gotten it yet ) and a color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way , so I 'm trusting you to see just how far before I buy it ! : ) If it wears well and looks as good as your mirror , which is gorgeous BTW , it will be worth it to me to pay the HUGE price . I have LOTS of projects and little time to do them , so the savings in the time it takes to sand , prime and paint would be well worth it to me . <p> I had never heard of that paint before so thanks for sharing . It creates a really nice finish , but that is pretty steep for a quart of paint . Unfortunately , there are n't  any retailers in Minnesota . The shipping charges drive me crazy . Your mirror looks great ! <p> I 'm so glad you showed the color options . I have two things to paint for my daughters room re-do . She wants distressed white . The grey that you used looks like white in the picture . My problem is that i 'm not sure if i should order the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just painted my first piece with Annie Sloan Provence and I love it ! This paint is so easy to work with and because it dries so quickly , I was finished with my project in record time . I saved money on primer , I saved precious time and have plenty of paint left for many more projects . My brushes clean super quick and easy with soap and water . The best thing is that I am not filling the atmosphere with toxic spray paint overspray . Sorry , but everybodies spray paint obsession is really bugging the go-green part of my brain . I read Annie Sloans response to your questions and I liked her answers . Why should she give away her families recipe for the big guys to copy ( Valspar-Behr .. etc ) . Chalk paint has been around for many years . It is not , as some have suggested , a new fad with a high price tag . This paint comes from England .. that 's the reason for the high price tag .. it is not a rip off . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing mentality and realize that quality often comes with a higher cost . Thanks for an unbiased and helpful review . Okjust my two cents.or should I say $39.00 . <p> I was wondering when you would try chalk paint ! I just did my first project with Paris Grey as well and I am in love ! Hope to post about it later this week . I found it easy to work with and fun to wax . Look forward to some future projects with some bolder colors as well . -Amanda P.S. I remember the post about this mirror in questions . . . you were right to paint it ! It looks wonderful and makes the dresser stand out . <p> Hi again you guys on Centsationalgirl ! I can see you are all price conscious an important point but with this paint you do not use primers /undercoats and the paint goes further than normal paints , so therefore it is not a ridiculous price . It is quick and easy to use , can be used as a wash or thickly , it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker and you can then add water if it is too thick . You do need wax at the end though so that is an extra additional price . Anyway , we 've been making the paint for 20 years and its still sticking to the furniture ! Annie <p> I have n't tried it yet , but I certainly want to . I 'm also curious about what makes it so durable , and able to stick to any surface like that , but I want to give it a try ! I was incredibly shocked to find out that there 's a store in my city that sells Chalk Paint . I was sure I would have to order it and pay for shipping ! Your mirror is gorgeous . I cant believe you got it for such a bargain ! ! <p> I too jumped on the band wagon and placed a very large order . I have 5 cans of paint , the waxes and the wax brush . I love it . I used the Provence to paint a $15.00 GW dresser that was green . I sanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am in the middle of painting a Cherry coffee table the Off White color and used the Paris Grey for a sofa table . I think the initial price is shocking but I think the paint goes a long way . Since you only used 1 coat for your mirror you skipped several other steps and painted it in 10 minutes that could justify the price alone . You could easily do a big dresser and another project with the leftover paint . I would like to see the price lower . <p> I appreciate your review . I 've seen this paint featured on another blog ( Miss Mustard Seed ) and she seems to love it . But I 'm trying to figure out why its so much better than regular paint . ? ? ? What am I missing here ? I know you do n't  have to prime but I rarely prime when I 'm going for a rustic look anyway . <p> I guess I 'm wondering why pay so much for this paint ? Just to skip the primer ? <p> I have been dying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has kept me at bay . I also had all those questions about how this works so well without primer . And you along with others have mentioned how easily it distresses so how it will hold up over time concerns me . Wont all the paint just rub right off ? That would seriously defeat the point of using such expensive paint . So with that being said I 'm off to read the Q&amp;A = ) <p> Thanks for an honest review . Your mirror looks great ! It seems as if a lot of bloggers are jumping on the chalk paint band wagon . Other than your review , I 've only read one other that gave a thoughtful critique of this product . <p> Sorry , Annie Sloan . No matter how you try to justify it , chalk paint , IMO , is not worth the hefty price tag . If you figure in a gallon can of latex paint , a can of primer and wax or polyurethane to complete the project , I 'm still not $100+ out of pocket . <p> Thank you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cost . I really could not justify using for furniture for resale . I just would not make any money . It looks great and I would love to try it and I know it comes from England , but I am just saying . Come on ! <p> Yes , I just bought this and tried it yesterday and today . My opinion : wow , the price ( ! ) , but no primer needed and it dries quickly so the next coat can go on quickly.kind of balances out the price if time is an issue . I bought the old white and paris grey cause I 'm a safe decorator . I am refinishing a dresser . I grabbed a drawer and decided to practice . I put on a coat of the grey and hated it . Then I put white over it and I think I messed it up a bit by drying it with a hair dryer ( impatient as I was ) . I used latex glaze on the crevices . Hmmm.then I put on the wax . Umnot in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her ilk for making it look so easy . And then I cursed myself because I 'm not really a shabby chic kind of decorator , so *what* was I thinking in the first place ? ! <p> OK , so today I decided to just bite the bullet and ruin the whole dresser . I painted the body in the gray , then went back over it with a wash of the white paint ( watered down ) . And oh.my.word . It was gorgeous ! I felt like I was getting my mojo back . Tonight I brought in all the drawers and painted them in the white , and then followed up with a white wash so the paint would n't be thick . I plan on waxing it , and then going over the whole piece in a dark wax ( hey , does anyone know if I can mix Minwax stain with the wax to make a dark wax ? Cause this chick is n't buying anything else for this dresser ! ) . I like the fact that I can paint with this paint in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take it back outside to wax it , so I 'm not sure that I 'm gaining much on that . <p> So right now , here 's my conclusion : this is best if you want distressed paint , and it looks best if you use two colors , or at least sand back the edges of your piece . ( Sorry if this was too long ! ) <p> I 'm also so glad to see you give a straight-up review . I understand Annie Sloans desire to keep her recipe secret . But we are some of the most ingenious people in a country founded on ingenuity and there is nothing we crafty gals cant figure out right ? I am currently thinking about trying tinted gesso in lieu of Annie Sloans . Gesso is used by artists to prime their canvases and it is cheap ! Traditionally it was made from animal glue and gypsum , a chalk-like substance ( ! ) . These days , the animal glue has been substituted for more modern binders . From what I can see , my challenge will be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . Gesso is usually white , but also can be found in black . I 've seen brightly colored gesso made in Japan , but its cost prohibitive . I 'm investigating a highly-pigmented acrylic paint from Golden to use for added color , but havent tried it out yet . But I am looking forward to experimenting ! <p> I love the way the mirror looks and have been wanting to repaint ours in our entryway as well . I do n't  know if I can make myself pay $51 to get that paint in my hands . I wonder why we cant purchase it at any of the the regular hardware stores ? ? <p> I love the way the mirror looks and have been wanting to repaint ours in our entryway as well . I do n't  know if I can make myself pay $51 to get that paint in my hands . I wonder why we cant purchase it at any of the the regular hardware stores ? ? <p> I 'm going to play devils advocate here for a minute . I see several complaints here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quart of the paint , but it goes really really far . I can see the drawback of paying $39 ( or $51 with shipping ) for paint for a mirror . However , if you only used a little bit of the paint , then really , how much of that $39 was really spent on the mirror ? Maybe $2 or $3 ? You would n't hesitate to spend that amount on a can of spray paint for a mirror and you would feel thrifty doing it . You also save a lot of time because you do n't  have to do all the prep that would have to be done to get latex to stick . You do n't  have to use multiple coats to get good coverage . The wax step , I think , is easier than the regular sealing step and is a bit more fool-proof too . So , you have n't really spent more money and you 've saved time and energy . <p> As for Annie keeping her formula secretmore power to her ! I 've done a lot of reading and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets with it and it holds up . I do n't  think the pros would be using it if it werent holding up and they have many years of experience with it and its still working for them . So I think it does have a proven track record . <p> And finally , the last reason I can think of to use it instead of regular old latex is that you get a different look and the distressing is better . Plus , you can mix your own colors or add water for your own consistency . Its pretty versatile . <p> Just some food for thought . : - ) I do n't  have any affiliation with the company . I 've just been doing a lot of reading on the product and planning some projects of my own . Thanks for trying it out and reviewing it for us . <p> Hi ! Thanks for the review . I was initially SHOCKED at the price too , but I have to admit , I just ordered several different colors . I ordered from the seller Miss Mustard Seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shipping was the same if you ordered one qt or four , so why not order the most I can and save on shipping . : ) I 'm planning on using it for my kitchen cupboards because the thought of having to take them all down and sand and primenope . Not with 3 kids . I hope to get it in the mail any day now . I also ordered some to paint my daughters floor . We live in a 1850 stone house , and the wooden floors were not in the prettiest shape . I did n't  sand her floor when we moved here ; just painted over it . Its peeling and looks terrible now , so I 'm hoping this paint will spare me the trouble of sanding and all . My daughter picked Provence for her roomwell see how it looks . : ) <p> Ive been wondering the same thing why do n't  you need primer if its a water based paint ? I 'd really love to know what the " secret " ingredient is : ) I have n't tried this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Thanks for keeping it real with an honest review ! <p> I have n't bought any of the chalk paint , mainly because I do n't  have a project to use it on , and I just do n't  need to add to my stash of stuff I cant get to . But ! I wanted to put my two cents in : ) <p> In my opinion , from what I have read here and on other blogs , that quart of chalk paint really seems to go as far as a gallon . You even said you had lots left over and a little bit went a long way . And you do n't  have to prime , another savings . And the drying time is super fast , that makes time for other projects right ? And not to mention , this is not a paint you would use on your walls , so if furniture and mirrors are what you are going to be using it for , it sounds like the coverage goes just as far as a gallon of regular paint . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So can we really compare it to the cost of a off brand Home Depot paint ? <p> I am glad Annie does n't  give away her secret , and I feel bad that people are trying to figure out the mixture . I think this company deserves the success for all hard work and marketing it has put in for 20 years . Isnt that what the American dream is all about ? <p> I have n't meet Annie nor have I bought her paints , but I will probably one day , when that " have to " project comes along . <p> OK , I have tried this paint on a dresser and two small table so far . I did the dresser in my kitchen so the lack of odor and prep is great . So far I have found that if I wait a few hours before distressing I can control the look better I do n't  get to the base wood so fast when sanding . I also think that by waiting a day or two before using the piece the paint seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mixed with clear wax to color tint the wax , and I think this is a neat trick . I 'm thinking of mixing Paris gray with wax for my bed . Paris gray is a beautiful color . I still have a lot of paint left even though I first used it like a latex , two coats for base color , which is not needed . I do like this paint a lot , and I am lucky that I can take a two hour car trip and buy the paint for $30.00/quart . <p> I used the chalk paint to do my kitchen cabinets . One quart covered all of my cabinets . I did n't  have to do the prep work on the cabs , and that was the major reason I decided to paint the maple cabinets ( 5 yrs old ) with the chalk paint . It came out great . I started out by painting a secretary first , and I was unsure about it , but the wax finish does stand up to washing , so I figured it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grey looks like auto primer ( I bought both Paris Grey and Old White ) . I think essentially this product is just a primer , but it works for me. $70 to do an entire kitchen , not bad . <p> So glad you did this post ! ! I just received my Annie Sloan and Paris Grey paints today from the Faux Finishing Institute in Mississippi . I ordered yesterday and they were delivered this morning via UPS . I have a queen bed ( headboard and foot board ) , french dresser and four chairs that I am planning on painting . I am so excited ! Ive been debating for a month to purchase and finally bit the bullet . <p> Yes , the price is might seem a bit expensive but I 'm looking forward to using a safer paint that is water based , easy to apply , quick drying and best of all a little goes a long way ! <p> The mirror came out greatIve been using Annie Sloans Chalk paint for a couple of months now and love it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale it is still cheap compared to buying new . Its very easy to work with , forgiving , and cleans up so easy and is eco-friendly . A quart also goes a long wayand the colors are just so vibrant . You can also buy the small samples of paint which are a lot cheaper . You can paint an entire dresser + with the size of a sample . Happy Painting , Marianne : ) <p> After trying some of our own projects at home , were starting to use this paint in our furniture refinishing business . The benefits ( low-VOC , easy to work with , fast drying , no need to prime , lovely finish , easy to distress ) seem to outweigh the cost for us . I 'm very hopeful , because I 'd love to be able to use a product that 's effective AND safer for the environment ! <p> I talked with a stockist about this paint a few months ago and thought it was a great solution for putting together that look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decor for this to work in , but I think its great for that distressed French style . <p> Other than the cost ( by the time you buy the paint AND wax ouch ! ) , I was struck by the " feel " of the stockists samples . Perhaps they werent properly sealed although they were waxed , but they felt " chalky " to me . When I touched them , I wanted to wipe my hands on my jeans . It was n't the smooth finish Im used to getting on my painted furniture pieces . Does that make sense ? I 'd love to hear your thoughts on that with yours properly sealed . <p> Wouldnt milk paint work the same way , or does that give a different look ? I 've added water to regular old latex paint to use as a " wash " ( on walls ) and on furniture ( dresser ) for a distressed look , and after 10+ years the dresser still looks great . <p> I suspect that the secret to this paint is lime ( the mineral ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . There is no gloss when this paint dries and you can increase the open ( workable ) time of this paint by adding water . I personally like the smooth cool finish and then waxing it makes it glow . I also bought the colored wax and had some clear on hand . <p> I find after doing 3 projects with it that the paint is near endless in the can .. loves and fishes paint ! so while its only a quart I am getting tons of coverage and uses from one can so I think the $$ evens out with the exception of that shipping issue ( pooh ! ) <p> Next week I am using a new order of the paint in the green for the kitchen in my studio a bit nervous but totally excited to try it on SUCH a big project . <p> Love the frame Kate , beautiful finish ! I have just recently used the Annie Sloan paint . And yes , it was very very expensive , and I am a very thrifty crafter . I finished a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Armoire . I loved the look of it . I bought a quart of the paint , and both clear and dark wax . I gave the cabinet two coats of paint , and on the doors 3 coats . I still have at least 1/2 of the quart left . I used the clear wax , then the dark wax , and then followed up with the clear wax again . I ran out of clear wax , and had to finish up with a clear paste wax from Lowes . I will probably go that way again , as the cost of wax at Lowes was 1/3 the price of the Annie Sloan . I found that using a brush for the paint left brush marks , I think I needed to thin the paint more than I did . Anyway , I love the project , I will use it again , but will finish up this quart first . You can see my project here . **36;1243;TOOLONG . <p> In my opinion , when you consider the price of striping , priming , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost is n't that bad . The paint goes a long way and leaves a beautiful finish . Im sold on chalk paint . I have to stop myself from painting everything ! Debbie <p> Thanks for the great review ! I still have not made that purchase because of the ouch price tag . Might wait a few months to see how it is withstanding on everyday items that have been painted by others . Not having to sand and prime sounds like a dream ! Have a great weekend ! XO Kristin <p> I have often admired furniture pieces at antique markets that have a very matte finish and thought how they resemble gesso . One thing I thought you might appreciate in the above link is the recipe for chalk paint because the version you posted is uber-expensive . But then again , I 'm not sure how readily available and/or expensive " rabbit-skin glue " is ! " <p> I 've seen a couple of blog posts saying that chalk paint is just latex paint with non-sanded grout added . ( You know , like the DIY chalkboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it than for the chalkboard paint , but I have n't tried it myself yet . You can bet Im going to soon , when I paint a bookcase I just got for free . Maybe the paint is one of those paint &amp; primer in one deals , since it sticks so well . <p> I 'm wondering how painting with this compared to the tinted chalkboard paint you wrote about in March ? Chalkboard paint is very durable and will stick to just about anything , is cheaper and you can get the exact color you want.but I 'm curious if it performs as well as AS paints do . I 've often heard of people using it for furniture and whether its called chalk paint or chalkboard paint I 'm thinking its the same thing . <p> I purchased a quart of Old White and was very pleased with the coverage . I also purchased a quart of Louis Blue ( at the suggestion of the stockist because she was out of Duck Egg Blue ) . I did n't  care for the Louis Blue and doubt I 'll use it so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . Every time I look at the can I see wasted dollar signs : ( For my taste its just too little boy blue . Live and learn . I have 2 dressers and a chair to finish so I 'll be ordering more of the Old White and hopefully this time the Duck Egg will be in stock . Its just too easy to not use it . No smell , no prep ( other than cleaning ) and I can even paint it in the room its in , so no hauling outside to spray . <p> Try the milk paint girls ! ! I have used it for years with GREAT results . It is usually available at your local hardware stores for 14.95 a quart . It has that same chalky feeling and I have never had to sand or prime my furniture . I will be trying the Annie Sloan paint because her colors are fabulous and her paint can is super cute . <p> I am the northern CA stockist for Annie Sloan Chalk Paint . I would be happy to answer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple here it is n't latex paint with something added . There is no plastic in the paint . It is very porous and works wonderful with the wax ! YOu can even paint right over the wax if you change your mind ! It seriously sticks to everything and even though a quart pot is $38.95 , it spreads 140 150 square feet with no priming or sanding or stripping.not a bad deal . Teri so sorry you did not like the Louis Blue . You can change up that tint a bit if you use a bit of the dark wax . It will tone it down . I would be willing to give you a pot of Duck Egg Blue at a discount so you could paint over it . Contact me ! FYI we have workshops , parties and I will soon have a mini stockist up near Sonoma so it can be purchased more locally ! Follow my blog and keep up with the Chalk Paint family additions ! And Centsational Girl I am your nearest stockist ! ! <p> First , the mirror is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next week or two ( stay tuned ) . Second , I just had to say that Vicki Shoemakers offer was bar none the exemplary in customer service ( I 'd love to deal with her if I lived on the west coast ) , how nice of her to offer her expertise and a discount on a future purchase . <p> hi kate , thanks for the review on the chalk paint . your mirror turned out fab ! there are pros and cons to this product , just like any other paint-nothing is perfect . here 's what i liked , goes on smooth sands easily , if i did get brush strokes on my piece i just sanded them right out ! what i did n't  like , i painted a dining room table and waxed it with johnsons paste wax , when we ate at that table later after i had painted it ( probably a week later ! ) it was left w/ greasy stains from the shredded cheese we had w/ dinner . i had to repaint the whole table top w/ latex to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repainting it w/ chalk paint first , but that did n't  work . i also tried it on an end table in my liv . rm. and i am very pleased w/ how it is holding up . but , i was very disappointed about the dining table , the product says it can be used on kitchen cabs , so i would think it would be fine for a dining tabl. also , i had a desk w/ that fake paper wood w/ a glossy finish and after painting it w/ chalk paint i could just run my fingernail over it and scrape it right off ! so then i tried sanding the desk and repainting w/ the chalk paint , still it scraped right off w/ my nail ! and yes , that was AFTER waxing ! that being said , there are many things to love about this paint . i did use it on a dresser for a client and it turned out beautiful ! hopefully she wo n't eat cheese off of it ! ; ) anyway , just wanted to know if anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ! thanks ! <p> Ive been looking into the Annie Sloan paint lately , and I have a question I have been unable to find an answer for . The paint is touted as low-VOC which I love , but I can not find the VOC level in the Annie Sloan paste wax . When I looked at the wax containers at the box stores , they ran very high on the VOC level , so I am assuming that her wax is similar . <p> It says on her website that the wax is very low odor , but that does not necessarily equate into low VOCs . It is a little telling to me also , that the VOC level is not mentioned on the website description either ( it is on the paint description ) . But perhaps I am mistakenwhich I hope I ambecause I would love to try this out . <p> If anyone has a can , is the VOC content listed on it ? email protected Thanks so much for your help with this ! <p> I was given a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table is dated , but I wanted it specifically because its begging for AS Chalk Paint . Now I am scared to take the plunge ! One of my favorite boutiques carries it , but do n't  know much about it at all . <p> I have the same concerns with the Chalk Paintprice ! ! ! You might want to try Briwax for the wax after painting . You can get it in colors &amp; is wonderful I use it on any antiques I buy . Its a lot cheaper than the wax A S carries . You can check online for prices &amp; closest shipping . If near a Restoration Hardware , they used to carry it &amp; I 've found it in a few antique malls . I primarily use the daark brown <p> Hi there ! Ive been using the ASCP for about a month , and I 'm pretty happy with it . If you have a really shiny piece , though , you 'll want to sand it to get rid of the shine . I have had some problems with the wax , but didactic sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really do n't  see a difference . I think I 'll continue with the varathane as it offers more protection . You can get it in a satin finish , so it will look very similar to the buffed wax . A gallon of this stuff is about $35 , but will last a long time- AND it wont yellow over time . <p> Your mirror looks great but I have to agree with you the cost is very high . I ve been using this paint for over six months , and have tried a few colors , I can purchase throug Spokane Artworks and have it shipped to Canada where I live . If I buy it in Canada the cost is 49.95 a quart plus shipping which runs me close to 80.00 when I am done . I do sell my work and find more and more customers are asking for that paint so I can recoup my costs . I do feel that if does get very pricy for everyone . The time and ease in which you can work with this paint is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a must or it will show water marks and spills . <p> In response to the comment above about the chalk paint scraping off with your fingernail , even after waxingdid you let it cure for a few days before trying to scrape it ? Ive chalk painted metal a few times , and , when I do , after waxing and buffing , I just let it sit for a week . No problems . Hope that helps . <p> Calcium Carbonate is the " base " of ASCP . I have mixed it with regular latex paint to create my own chalk paint . Works like a charm ! The nice thing about mixing it with regular latex paint is that you are n't  limited to color . Let me know if you would like more info ! ! ! <p> I use the Ben Moore paint with the primer right in it and with excellent results . Tons of colors and a lot cheaper , but it is not chalk paint Guess it depends on what you want to do . I love the mirror ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and absolutley love it ! ! ! I have used the Old White for the Shabby Chic look and Paris Grey with the Old White as accents to create that " Paris Look " or a French Provincial twist . I look for maple furniture from the 60s that is readily available on craigslist in my area . I then paing and resell the pieces . This paint is a dream to work with ! ! ! I recommend 2 coats , you can add water when doing the second coat to stretch it out . I use a terry cloth covered sponge for the wax application . I mix the wax with Mineral spirits in a bowl ( 1:1 ) and then wipe on , works GREAT . I have n't tried other waxes but have heard they do n't  work as well . I even used this paint and wax to redo my ugly oak kitchen cabinets with first the clear wax then a bit of the dark wax for that antiqued look . I have a whole new kitchen without sanding or a big mess . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the primer built in . Not as expensive as Annie Sloan and works well when you do n't  want a distressed look . Debbie <p> I have used this paint on several projects and love it . The first thing I used it on was a heavily carved Broyhill end table stained in a dark mahoghany . I painted it Duck Egg Blue and Old White . I painted the intricate trim with an artists brush for more precision . I used clear wax and the dark wax . It looks absolutely gorgeous . I then did a similar treatment for a vanity with matching bench , I just lightened up the Duck Egg Blue with some white . It also looks great . I did an ornate metal lamp that I paid $2.48 in Old White and the clear and dark wax . Again , it looks fabulous . I had a coffee table that I got at a thrift store for $6.48 , it is not heavily carved , I did it in Old White and did the wax treatments over it . I like the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the dark wax full strength over the clear , whereas before , I had mixed the clear and dark for the second coat . I am going to paint over the top of it with French Linen , and then do the wax treatment , I bet that will look better . And for $6.48 , so what if it does n't  ? At this rate , I may end up painting everything in my house in chalk paint ! <p> I love AS Chalk Paint . It goes on oh so smooth and sands like a breeze . I HATE the wax . Maybe I 'm just not used to using a paste wax . It seems like a real workout putting it on rubbing it off buffing it outphew . Today I mixed Howards Feed and Wax with a bit of AS dark wax . It was sooo much easier to put on . I 'll see how it buffs out in the morning . Has anyone used other waxes that are less expensive and softer but not as soft as Howards ? <p> Great maiden voyage , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chalky " , hence the name . That 's why you really need to wax after sanding lightly , the dry finish . As another said , $35 for a can that will refinish several pieces of inexpensive furniture and bring them up to date , is a small price to payespecially when very little prep work is needed ! Pricing does vary , between $35-40 . Check to see if you have a local source and can save on shipping . Its even fun ! Cheers , Barbara , a budding furniture refinisher at The Treasured Home <p> Try using Ce Ce Caldwell paint next time . If you live on the East Coast near South Carolina you can get it for under $30 per quart . West Coast $37 a quart . It is made of chalk and clay base and has beautiful colors . <p> I may be a little late adding my $.02 on this thread , but here goesI LOVE the ASCP , but it is pricey and colors are slightly limitedYou can mix Plaster of Paris ( 4 lbs for $6 at Craft &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little bit of warm water and it comes out fantastic and VERY NEAR the ASCP . You MUST MUST mix the Plaster of Paris with water BEFORE adding it to paint to get out the gritkind of like whisking flour/water before adding it to gravy1:3 ratio ( plaster:paint ) works for me , and add enough water to make your plaster similar to ( food reference again ) a thin pancake batter texture It dries , distresses , and goes on great and chances are very high you already have a zillion paint samples lying around . <p> Sidenote : I searched high and low for an ASCP retailer near me , finally found one while travelling out of town and bought oodleswasnt until I came home and started using it that I looked for an alternative with more color variety <p> I would love to try this paint , but it seems like this paint may be more for " looks " than durability . I want tops of dressers and vanities to be hold up and be resistant to everyday normal wear and tear . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  work out so great . Anyone have testimonials as to durability ? Thanks ! <p> Hi Stacey , I 've used Chalk Paint a lot on various pieces around my home and for friends , and I think its durable , but I 've never used it on a kitchen table or cabinets so I cant speak to its durability on those high use surfaces , others might be a better resource for that . Wish I could offer better advice ! Kate <p> I am going to mix the plaster of Paris with paint to try and get the same effect . Do I need to sand or prime the furniture if it has a varnish on it ? Can it be used on that fake wood furniture ? Do you use flat paint when mixing ? Should I use a matte shellac over it or just rub with Johnson paste wax ? Sorry for so many questions but I want to get it right . Thanks for your help . Sandie <p> Hi Sandie , I have n't tested the Plaster of Paris recipe for Chalk Paint , so until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work on previoulsy painted surfaces . The protective finish will determine your sheen , so you 're free to use flat , but I do love a paste wax finish and Johnsons works nicely . Kate <p> I love Annie Sloans chalk paint ! I actually made a pretty functional chalkboard right on my wall in my dorm last semester . I 'm definitely going to do another chalkboard next semester ( though this time on a thin sheet of birch plywood or some laminate so I can use it multiple time and for a smoother finish ) . <p> Kate , I love what you did with the mirror . Good move using Johnsons wax in place of the Annie Sloan one . <p> Dear Kate , I had to go back to this article and re-read it . My beautiful soon to be 9 y.o . wants her bedroom redone and I have a great desk I bought for her , classic lines , real wood that I want to paint over but like you said , Annie Sloan is just way too pricey for me . But thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a huge fan of Annie Sloan chalk paint . I have done several older pieces in my home , as practice for a larger project.my kitchen cabinets . Although the paint is expensive , I was able to do my entire kitchen with ONE quart of paint , and TWO quarts of clear wax ( and I still have some left over ) . For $115 approximately , my kitchen looks amazing ! 23102 @qwx883102

I Kate , mother of young elementary school children , did not hard-boil nor dye any Easter eggs last year . I used fake ones from a craft store to set our Easter dinner table and plastic ones for the egg hunt . Boom , easy , done . <p> We started with hard boiled eggs , some dye from those kits you find everywhere , and a bunch of rolls of glitter and washi tape sent to me by my kind sponsor Wishy Washi . <p> To create a banded pattern , I wrapped a few with washi tape before dipping , then once my girl dipped the eggs and they were dry , peeled back the tape to reveal the pattern . <p> Layering a thin strip of tape over the top gives them a two tone banded effect . <p> Once they were dipped and dried I layered several more of them with more washi or glitter tapes , some as is , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few dots of nailpolish to create a spotted treatmemt on two of the eggs before dipping them in the dye . It takes a few applications but look what are the perfect perch for the spotted eggs while the dots dry the washi tapes ! <p> For an easy centerpiece , I nestled them in grass inspired by the traditional Easter egg hunt . <p> I found some wheat grass at my local market and used it as a bed for the decorated eggs . <p> The table is all ready to enjoy a nice Sunday brunch after church . I think I 'll throw some chocolate candies in there too , no such thing as too much chocolate on Easter ! ( Or any day , right ? ) <p> Kate you are still top notch in my bookannual dyed eggs or not ! My daughter &amp; I are literally starting ours right now . I have dye , lots of little notions , glue &amp; glitter . I like the nail polish idea . Thinking we can paint flowers ! Thankswill try to post at //www.mysoulfulhome.com on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kelly <p> I thought that I recognized your tablecloth . I had picked one up for my daughters apartment next fall , but I love your clever use of it . The eggs are beautiful , too ; just like most everything else on your site . Thanks for inspiring me , and have a glorious Easter ! <p> Ok , you truly out did yourself ! This is so very lovely ! I usually do n't  " steal " ideas from other bloggers when it comes to decor , but this is too amazing not to steal ! Its too late for this year but I definitely want to try this for other years to come . Gorgeous and unique ! <p> My days of dyeing eggs are long gone much to the dismay of my 18 and 25 year old daughters . : ) What a great idea for a tablecloth and really inexpensive as well . I will start looking at shower curtains differently ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057845 @3257845/ <p> Kidding ! I could never part with it . Unless you make me an offer I ca n't refuse . <p> Back to biz . So I 've had this little console table for like ever that I painted white over the weekend . <p> This console is no antique , in fact it 's a mass produced hall table from Bombay Company and it has suffered some dents and scratches in the dozen years I 've had it , so I had no issues with painting it . <p> Mkay . Well guess what . The dark tones and traditional feel of that table were n't working in the space , so I freshened it up with a little paint . Hey white paint ! The cure for anything ! Vicki , a local stockist for Annie Sloan Chalk Paint recently sent me some Old White ' to try , so this little console table was the perfect candidate . This shade is not a bright white , it 's really more of a vanilla or a cream in most light . <p> Ooh la la , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'm loving most about this chalk paint is the way it distresses around the edges with light sanding so easily and beautifully . <p> I also hung the scroll mirror that used to hang in my kitchen above the mantel , but now hangs above this console table . It works well with the French inspired feminine aesthetic in the room . <p> Although I 've used the Annie Sloan paint ( and like it ) its overly pricey . I have found that using flat latex paint is just as easy to distress . Flat paint on furniture , you say ? Yes ! Once you finish it with polyurethane and/or wax , it does just fine . Its when you use satin or eggshell latex that you get the rubbery-peeling problem when distressing . Sometimes you have to prime before using flat latex but not always . It just depends on what you 're painting . <p> Girl , I would frame that towel and maybe secretly kiss it every day . Okay , kissing is going overboard , but I would admire it . I love Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Connick Jr . I think that console table looks great in whiteyou are so good at styling your photos ! <p> Back in 2008 , I was caring for my sister Mary ( she was battling cervical cancer ) while she was in a Providence , RI hospital . I was sleeping in the room with her every night and not seeing much of the light of day ( no complaints ) . <p> The kind ladies over at the Dunkin Donuts Arena heard about my sisters medical prognosis and wanted to do something for her . She was not well enough to leave the Medical Center to attend the Buble concert being held at the Arena , so guess who went in her place.ME ! ! ! ! <p> They gave me fabulous tickets for my nephew ( Marys son ) and myself . It was incredible as you well know . Michael .. yes we are on first name basis .. puts on such a fabulous show . <p> It was just the fun time I needed during that very stressful time in my life . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would give anything ( within reason ) to meet Brad Paisley . I 'm crazy about him , his incredibly talented band , and his voice . And the corny humor in his tunes . <p> Never heard of chalk paintbut that table looks like it was made for that spot now ! <p> Wow ! ! Lucky girl ! I LOVE Michael ! I saw him last August and cant wait to see him again . He is such a great performer and seems so genuine . Glad you had an amazing time . : ) <p> I 'm in Canada and chalk paint is finally making its way here , but the price tag of $50 is WAY steep for me . I 'd like to try someday though . From all the posts Ive read around blogland , it sounds soo easy to work with . Oh , and your table looks gorgeous ! <p> I love that table ! And I love the Annie Sloan CP colors ! So did you sand first at all ? Or just paint , wax , sand for detail ? You made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , is it that simple ? <p> Did you notice how much heavier the quart was than a normal quart of latex ? ! <p> For those who think the pricetag is super steep you are right . BUT ! Did you know you can water it down ( without any affect to performance ) and make go even further ? I recently did my entire bedroom suite on one quart ( two nightands , dresser , chest ) . <p> The singer that still makes me go gaga is Rick Springfield . Yep , I said it . I have met him multiple times over the years and have attended at least ten of his concerts . Looks like you had a great time . Love the chalk paint . I have tried it on a few projects . Looking to paint something else real soon . I 've tried the old white and the duck egg blue so far . Love how easy it is to work with . I love how your table came out .

I love Micheal Buble but have never been so lucky to see him in person . <p> I recently got my hands on some ASCP and LOVE it ! ! !

Your console looks great ! ! ! <p> Hhhmmm , I love music , but sadly I do n't  think there is anyone that would really make me swoon . Maybe I need to go to more concerts and find out . <p> I love Annie Sloan Chalk Paint so far . I 've painted one project on my own . And this weekend , I took an Chalk Paint class with our local stockist . Its low odor and very easy to work with . A tip , from the class you do n't  have to sand to distress . After the paint is dry , use an old towel that is damp and rub . It was very easy to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to decide what other colors to add to my arsenal .

But I 'm afraid I would be just that loopy over John Mayer ( even though he can be a jerk ) or , even better , Joshua Radin or Jack Johnson ! Please , Jack , make me some banana pancakes ! <p> My favorite singer is Annie Sloanno , wait , its that band , Chalk Paint . No . Well , never mind . You got me confuzzled when you moved the writing desk to the foyer and the console table to the daughters room and the sweaty towel to the laundry room . I think . <p> Love the console table in that color and , yeah , Buble is pretty good . Switching genres , Brad Paisley is the best entertainer out there and a ridiculously talented musician . Luciano Pavrotti was the greatest singer of all time , of course , and he did sweat alot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so do n't  bother checking eBay for that . Just sayin . <p> That 's such an exciting story about Michael ! In college I went to see the Bare Naked Ladies with some friends . At one point , the lead singer jumped off the stage and headed up to our seats and danced/sang/played his guitar right in my seat ! It was a pretty exciting 30 seconds ! <p> John Mayer does it for me . I know he had his " weird with women " phase recently , but that voice can make you look past anythingThat perspective is probably why dating in my college years got me into some trouble . <p> Oh , I LOVE Michael Buble ! Me and Mrs Jones makes me weak in the knees . How cool that you caught his sweaty towel.even though it does n't  sound as cool when you say it out loud . I also love John Mayer .

I went to one of his concerts a few years ago and got to touch his arm twice when he ran through the crowd . It was one of the best concerts I 've been to . <p> Now , on to the Chalk Paint . I redid my dining room table over the summer with Old White and Chateau Gray ( which really looks green to me ) . The top and legs are Old White that I tinted with the Chateau Gray so it ended up a sagey green . The apron of the table is just Chateau Gray . I put 4 coats of wax on it and it turned out great . <p> I 'm working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I plan to get a few more colors as I can afford it . Red will probably be next ! <p> I 'm a huge Michael Buble and Harry Connick fan , too ! That said , I just checked off one of the things on my Bucket List ( okay , I 'm only 36 and have plenty of time to get things done hopefully but I think everyone should have a Life List of Things to Do/See ) and saw Tony Bennett in May . Wow ! The voice is still there and Ive never seen an artist who is so gracious and humble . <p> As for the chalk paint , you totally made my day ! I have Bombays square version of your console table , even down to the hardware . Ive been wondering whether I should just get rid of it since I no longer like the dark wood . This is great ! Also , chalk paint has worked wonders on the ugly , builders-grade , built-in linen cabinet in my house . <p> Would you be so kind to leave a comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makeover fund drive .

I have never used Annie Sloan chalk paint but your console transformation has convinced me to try it on a small little console I currently sitting in my garage . Thx so much <p> What a fun evening you had and amazing seats ! I love Michael Buble . Your console looks beautiful . I have not taken the plunge yet into chalk paint but always love the results I see . Hope your week is off to a great start !

Check him out in the this photo //www.towncentervet.com/ He is super sweet and so good with my Golden Retriever , Scout . Anyhow glad you had a fun night out . Love the table . I will have to try that chalk paint . <p> Hey Suzanne , yep , the chalk paint is easier , no sanding or priming . Ive read mixed reviews about durability , mostly good though . Time will tell !

Do you think it would be ok to put minwax polycrylic over it ? I really want to try chalk paint since it gets so many rave reviews but the price tag is deterring me , if I have to buy the special wax I may not do it at all because that makes it even pricier . <p> Amazing makeover , love it !

Yesterday I painted 1 coat of Old White onto a curio cabinet and I 'm worried its too creamy . Your photo and so many I 've seen makes your piece look quite white .

I used the wax ( all 3 coats like Annie says ) on my laundry room cabinets , unfortunately , you can see water streaks in front of the sink . I was pretty disappointed . Annie says that it is water repellent , not water proof and she just touches her cabinets up every now and then ( but I do n't  want to do this ) .

I went with a few girls a couple of years ago and he touched my hand .. and I was all giddy about it for days .

I was painting a MDF black shelf from crate and barrel that I had added moulding to . I used CeCe Caldwell paint and her soft wax because I cant get Anne S. in my hood . I was told not to prime , so we put the paint on and let it dry for two days . It hit the fan when we applied the soft wax . It did n't  distress it , it make it look like it was dirty w the black muddling w the gray chalk paint we used . What do you think I did wrong ? Thanks so much ! Gina 23102 @qwx883102

Ours did , and so many came out to pay tribute ! <p> I 'm working my way through my list of holiday crafts , and I finished up one half of a project today ! Were not hosting Thanksgiving this year , but I am helping with the table setting , so here 's one of my contributions : glitter leaf hurricanes ! Or should I say hurricane singular . . . I still have to finish the second one , but no worries . This is such a simple and quick project anyone can finish in under an hour . <p> I was all set to use my Silhouette craft cutter , but then I could n't find the little blade cutters , grrrr . I had to cut out my pattern the old fashioned way , which takes about ten times as long , but it also works if you cut slowly and carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I used a leaf pattern from my Silhouette library , then placed in directly on top of the sheet of adhesive vinyl and secured it with tape . You can use any clip art shape you find online , simply print it out in the size you need . <p> I was going to use the negative space created with the vinyl , but then realized the adhesive backing was stickier , so I used that instead . In hindsight , I 'm realizing the vinyl may have clinged better around the edges , so I may use that instead on the second hurricane . <p> You can spray paint so many things , including glass , so I used that as my base to get the glitter to stick . I sprayed a tiny bit of paint into the cap , then use a paintbrush to dab it on the glass . After I applied the paint , I sprinkled it with glitter . I repeated several times to get a thick application and design . <p> I used Krylons Caramel Latte but any color close to your glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of craft supplies . Allow to dry , then peel off your adhesive . <p> Clean up any bleeding of your paint outside the lines with a cotton swab dipped in mineral spirits or paint thinner . <p> here 's how it looks when you 're done ! <p> Anythings possible for your holiday table with glass , be it a candle holder or a vase . Snowflake designs would look so pretty with silver or white glitter . And it does n't  need to be permanent . Whenever you tire of your design , mineral spirits or paint thinner will remove the paint and glitter from your hurricane and return it to clear glass . Just in time for you to cover it with hearts for Valentines Day , right ? <p> love.love.love it ! ! I was wondering if you could reuse them , so glad you added how to remove itjust in time for adding a new design . Great ! ! I will file this away in my brain to use very soon . Thanks again for a great post ! <p> Great tutorial as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't  spray it on . duh ! Why do n't  you give us a post about other random facts like that ? Including how to use wax or Elmers to crackle paint . <p> Do you think it would be possible to glue glitter to the vinyl then you could stick it on for the holidays and just take it off when you want to try something new rather than having to pull out the mineral spirits and/or paint remover ? <p> I saw premade Thanksgiving hurricanes w/ the words " Thanks " etched that were $15 each and thought I could do this for pennies on the dollar for our communion tables at church using advent words w/ the hurricanes we already own ! Saw a similar process on Martha Stewart last year slip a silhouette picture inside the glass , trace &amp; flood design on outside w/ white glue ( from a narrow tip bottle ) and sprinkle w/ white glitter . I love your process , too ! TFP ! ! ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057849 @3257849/ <h> Adventures in Bottle Cutting <p> By Kate Riley September 20 , 2011 <p> I ca n't recall where or when I saw a bottle cutting kit , but I spied it somewhere a few months ago and thought it was completely cool . Around the same time , I saw a set of tumblers in a local shop made from the bottoms of wine bottles and thought they were a great way to repurpose old bottles into drinking glasses . <p> DIYer that I am , I determined bottle cutting was definitely on my learn to do this ' list ASAP . The kit I bought ( seen below ) ended up on a shelf in my office shortly after it arrived months ago , but last weekend as I was cleaning and sorting I noticed it again , and decided to give it a try . I spent a fall morning experimenting with the kit with mixed results , but in the end arrived at two decent cut glass vases made from a wine bottle and a champagne bottle . <p> Take a peek : <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn them into vases : <p> I must caution you , in my limited experience , this kit was a hit and a miss . The miss may be attributed to my lack of skills in this craft , but I did not end up with perfect edges . Read on ! <p> The kit comes with a scoring tool , instructions , and other supplies . Quite frankly , the value is in the green scoring tool alone . <p> The method is n't very complicated . First , you start with a glass bottle . Wine bottles are plentiful around here so I used one I had recently emptied *hiccup* cause I 'm really good at that . <p> You align your bottle , then with a steady hand etch a single line all around with the scoring tool . <p> Next , you cool with ice cubes and wait for the break . The basic science is this : the score line directs the cut and the quick change in temperature causes the break . It may take a few repetitions ( heat then ice , heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first bottle , I ended up with a lot of soot and an slightly uneven break . <p> Exhibit A : <p> Did that imperfection stop me from making it into a vase ? Heck no . <p> Of course you 're wondering about sharp edges , that was my biggest fear too . It 's true , the edges of my bottle were sharp but not like shards , more of a clean edge . I polished them up with the strip in the kit and that seemed to even them out just fine . Next I taped it off with painter 's tape and thin stickers and gave it a coat of gold spray paint to create some stripes . <p> Final result " a pretty decent vase for stems or blooms . <p> Feeling bold with my second try I went with a thicker champagne bottle ( seen above ) . With patience and a few repetitions of the heat then ice technique , this bottle top came off with a cleaner cut . You an actually see the bottle begin to crack when you apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a throwback to science class . . . <p> I ended up with a much cleaner cut but this one also had slight imperfections . <p> As cool as this kit is , I have two bones to pick . First , it 's just a little pricey at $45 , but I suppose if you 're planning to make a bunch it might be worth it . There are other ways to score a bottle I 've read about online , one is a tile saw , the other is a Dremel , so if you have one of those , investigate those options . <p> Second , I do have to disagree with the creative craft for the entire family ' notion . . . <p> Those are tiny shards of glass that came off my etched bottle , see ? Perhaps I scored too deep , but those make this project off limits to any youngster if you ask me . <p> Here 's a final precautionary note : as with any DIY project working with glass and fire , use goggles , wear gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy videos about glass bottle cutting out there " just go look on You Tube . I found this one to be the most helpful source for tricks for getting a successful straight even cut . <p> I 'll definitely use the kit again , hopefully with smoother edges in the future . Meanwhile , I 've got vases that turned out pretty nice even if the tops are n't 100% perfect . <p> Oh , and if anyone wants to know about those outrageously cool stems in the wine bottle vase , they are a pumpkin tree plant . Teeny tiny little pumpkins on a stem just make my day I picked them up a few days ago at my local Trader Joes , awesome right ? <p> Anyone else ever had any adventures in bottle cutting ? What were your results ? <h> 64 comments <p> Yes , actually , I have a glass cutting kit , too ! I think I first used one many years ago at my Grandmothers place then I spied one a number of years ago at the local thrift store . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little different than yours . The important thing , if I remember correctly , is to score it slowly and only once ! I think it does n't  work as nicely if you go around a number of times . I have a number of old glass 7-Up bottles that I am waiting to turn into hanging candles lantern for our outside patio at our next house . I saw them in a crafty inspiration book and they were gorgeous ! <p> Hey Kate ! I too have been experimenting with cutting wine bottlesBeen using my dremel tool . I have n't perfected it quite yetbut when I do I will be sure to pass it along . I wanted to share with you a link to something I want to send you . I make theseand they are a perfect way to reuse a wine bottle . Can you email me your address ? PSI signed up for Havencannot wait to chat in person : ) LONG ... <p> I bought a glass cutting kit earlier this year , but never used fire . I used this tutorial //www.youtube.com/watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It uses hot and cold water to stress the glass . It works pretty well ! Its still hard to get a perfect edge ( I was trying to make glasses ) but if you 're going to use them for decoration the water method should work pretty well . I learned it was best not to score to deep , and to really take your time with the water . It was important not to let the water touch the whole bottle , just to try and get it only on the score line . It was tedious and I gave up on the glasses , haha . But itll probably be great for some different vases ! <p> I cut over 200 of these for my wedding centerpieces with the same kit . Using the candle and ice takes FOREVER so we needed something quicker . We discovered that if you score the bottle with the kit and then put the bottle in a pot of boiling water ( for 20 seconds-ish , depending on how hot the water gets and how thick the glass is ) and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much quicker and easier . With the thicker glass we sometimes had to come back to the hot water for a few seconds , but that usually did . Most of the time this resulted in a perfect separation of the two pieces . There is something so satisfying about that perfect separation of the two pieces ! <p> Also , sometimes the glass is cheap and nothing you can do will make the cut come out perfect . Same thing with some of the thicker glass . <p> I love this ! I went to a yard sale this weekend , and a lady cut off the bottom of the bottle and used the top with a candle under it for decoration on her porch . I loved it ! I may have to get one of these and try this , too . Then I could use the whole bottle up : ) <p> Wow , that is really cool . I never knew you could do that . I would be scared to do it of course fearing I would cut myself ( if it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks for sharing this cool project . I like how they bottles came out . <p> lol Fun for the whole family does seem to be pushing it . I suspect those slivers you got from cutting the bottle may also have something to do with different types of glass . I used to do stained glass with my mom when I was younger and some kinds of glass were just really prone to slivering and turning everything into a danger zone . You did end up with a couple of cute vases . : ) <p> I remember John from Young House Love having a go at it too , last year . His results where mixed too . But heck , raw edges or not , anything that will give you an excuse to empty a wine bottle is a winning project in my book . Really cool pumpkin stems there ! <p> I have seen a similar tutorial online but instead of using fire and ice to make the break , they simply poured boiling water over the bottle and the change in temp caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nifty , though ! I 've also seen people polish the edge with a Dremel tool . Maybe that would make it a bit smoother . <p> I 've never tried this with bottles , but when cutting glass for stained glass art projects you can run the score before separating the glass pieces with pliers to help get a cleaner cut . In stained glass , after making the score with the glass cutters , you tap along the score gently with the end of the glass cutter ( they usually have a weighted end for just this purpose ) . Again , I have no idea if this would help in getting a cleaner cut in bottle cutting but just thought I would mention it ! <p> I was excited when I saw you post this , because I have some mason jars I want to turn into lighting , but even more excited that a dremel will work ( and probably better ) , because my husband has every type of dremel attachment and is really good with the dremel . So , YAY . <p> Hi there Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this before and failed . My Aunt gave me a small tile cutter last year for Christmas and the first thing I tried was cutting a bottle in half . Perfection is all I can say . Sliced that bottle with the cleanest edge . I make all sorts of things now with the tile cutter . Try it , you will love the results I saw those little pumpkins at Trader Joes the other day I did n't  know they were real ! deezie <p> SUPER cool ! ! I was curious if you had thought of making a cool modern pendant light with the tops of the wine bottles ? I saw one recently on Pinterest i think and you just run the cord of a pendant kit from the bottom to the top and screw in the bulb . It looks SUPER pretty and funky and you couldahemhave a very good excuse to empty a few more bottles ! : ) Great job ! <p> Are you kidding ? ! My kids would have a glorious afternoon playing with those fun glass shards . It sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you were wise to keep the kids away . Shards or not , your striped vase is pretty cool . Love the little pumpkins . : ) <p> Kate , this project reminded me of another that I recently saw . . . a couple used upside down wine bottles as a trim around their garden . it was pretty cool and unusual , but the beautiful green colors of the glass were a great compliment to the landscape . <p> This is a blast from the past . All us baby boomers remember the glass cutting trend in the 70s and recently my husband and I went to a restaurant that used glasses cut from wine bottles for water . They were wonderful and I want to make some we surely have enough empty wine bottles to do it ! The waiter said that to smooth out the edges the cut edge needs to be torched somehow . Its on my " to do " list . <p> Hi ! I am the one that posted awhile back on my blog about a technique to cut glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish , fire and cold water . ( I was just super excited that I did n't  have to buy anything to do it ) . It worked great.my first time . I do n't  know if you are interested in checking it out here is the blog LONG ... <p> : o ) I LOVE being able to up-cycle everythingand glass bottles are no exception ! I love your version ! <p> I saw that kit or one like it at the Crafters Convention in LA this winter . I really looked at it seriously . The price ultimately turned me off . Great investment if you were going to do a bunch of centerpieces for a wedding or something . Just not for me at this time . I do love your gold stripes ! <p> My family and I lived in San Pancho , Mexico for a while and there is an organization there called EntreAmigos who up-cycles everything they can find and sells it in order to raise money for educational opportunities ( library , computer lab , sports classes , art classes , English classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular up-cycles is bottles into candles , glasses , vasesanything they can think of . The artists there use a special saw blade on an ordinary table saw to do the cutting . here 's a link with more info unfortunately not enough photos of the amazing glasswork . LONG ... <p> They also used broken glass from bottles as aggregate in the concrete when building their new building it was in the floor and countertops and SO amazingly pretty . They used all different colors of glass and buffed out the sharp edges . Beautiful . <p> I had one of these waaayyy back when they first came outthe 70s I think .. it does take some practice but the results can be cool as you are finding outtry looking in thrift shops or flea markets for the oldies first .. $45.00ouch ! Think they were only a few dollars when I got mine .. only about that price now if you find one in a thrift shop.you can also make great candle holders " Wine bottles are plentiful around here so I used one I had recently emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilarious ! ! ! ! <p> For someone who 's not skilled at glass cutting , I 'd say you did a fantastic job ! <p> I 'm a glass artist in Santa Rosa ( so I 'm especially thrilled that you 're " local " ! ) , and have cut bottles on my tile saw . Its fun to cut rings and fire-polish them in one of my kilns to use them in other projects , like wind chimes . <p> Ahhhh , I just saw where someone had taken a wine " jug " and had cut the bottom off to create a dome . They then used it w/ a round cutting board . A nice way to display or serve , say , cheese . This project sounds right up your alley . ; ) Once you have it completed , could you please post the results ? ; ) What a great gift idea , right ? <p> here 's my age showing.as a teen in the 70s , I actually remember a version of this glass cutting-kit , coming out as a very cool Christmas gift item . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapes , as the coolest new things for Christmas . A guy who I thought was " way-cool " , got one and we had a blast making drinking glasses , from " stubby " beer- bottles . The booklet that came with it also showed how to combine different cut bottles to create neato vases etc . Now that I 'm a grown-up , Ive taken Stained Glass courses and though I 've moved past the beer bottle drinking cups , I still think 8-tracks and K-TEL records are groovy ! ! hahah . My kids have NO idea what any of those things were and think stubby beer bottles looked weird . Sad . <p> Im exited that you 've tried glass cutting and that this post came out just now tomorrow were trying a different method to get the same result . Saw on Pinterest that if you soak yarn in acetone ( nail polish remover ) , put it around the bottle , light it on fire , and then dunk the whole thing in icy water , you get really clean cuts well see ! ! At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes terribly . <p> Question for Brenda J , 9-11-11 post about a glass cutting kit from the 70s . I am trying to do it for Christmas but I remember cutting the bottle then attaching the bottom half to the top half for a goblet effect . Does that ring a bell ? How do you connect the glass pieces ? Thanks <p> First cut a length of yarn that will wrap around the bottle a few times . ( I 've found 2 and a half works well ) Soak your yarn in nail polish remover Wrap the yarn around the bottle where you want the cut light the yarn on fire let it burn for about 30 seconds then dunk the entire bottle in cold water Viola ! The glass will break evenly right where the yarn was . <p> Easy to do in your kitchen sink and only takes 5 minutes ! NOT for little ones though ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057850 @3257850/ <h> Clay Petal Vase + Spring Craft Link Party <p> By Kate Riley March 22 , 2012 <p> Have I ever mentioned I want to take up sculpture ? No , I mean it , I really do . I want to take a real class someday to study the art form , it intrigues and inspires me to no end . So as I was aimlessly browsing the aisles of the craft store the other day ( a frequent habit ) I came across some moldable stone clay and thought , hey why not give it a try I 'm adventurous like that with $10 to burn . <p> What started out as an experiment ended up as something I 'm rather proud of , this pretty three dimensional clay petal vase that combines two loves of mine : white ceramic sculptural thingies and very big blooms . <p> No I did n't sculpt the vase ( ha ! I wish ! ) that was a purchase from Michaels , but I did sculpt the large bloom mounted on the front out of the white stone clay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First , grab yourself a pretty vase or vessel and some stone clay at a craft store . I used the Premier version and was happy to find it 's very soft and silky to the touch . Dare I say , sensual ? Hmm , maybe too strong a word , but it 's a really soft texture to work with . <p> I pulled off a piece and started to roll it out with a small PlayDoh rolling pin I borrowed from the kids ' stash that did n't work very well so instead I used my palm to create a smooth flat surface , and learned the warmth of my hand worked like magic . <p> Again experimenting , I tried different tools but found the back of a butter knife worked best for carving the petals . <p> Use the back of a steak knife ( another experiment ) to separate the clay petal from your work surface , then smooth with your finger you create little petals , like so . <p> Pinching the petals at the base helps them curl up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've probably concluded that this girl needs a manicure but honestly who 's got time ( I do n't ) but I welcome suggestions and I 've read good things about shellac , is that right ? Is that what we 're doing these days ? Somebody fill me in . <p> Build your blooms , large or small , by layering your petals one by one . <p> Smooth any imperfections , then leave the finished bloom to air dry overnight ( with this particular brand of clay ) . Once it 's solid , use an adhesive like Liquid Nails to attach the bloom to the vase , but make sure you allow sufficient drying time for the adhesive to cure before standing the vase up . <p> And hey , there 's no need to do white on white the dry clay is paintable so if you 're wanting color , then go for something more like this anemone vase by Anthropologie . A little craft enamel paint topped with a coat of high gloss will get you a similar look . <p> Practice with the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petal vase . <p> Who knows what this new found love of stone clay will lead to I know I 'll definitely try my hand at sculpting more little things if only to make whimsical little figurines with oddly painted faces to humor myself and my children . : ) For anyone who 's curious , that ridged ceramic urn is something I bought as a souvenir from my Joss &amp; Main sale a few months ago , but you can find both a small and large version here . <p> Crafted something for your home for the spring season ?

I 've only ever found it at Hob Lob , but its really fun to play with too . Youve given me a great idea I see a butterfly clay vase in my future . ; ) <p> Oh my word that is awesome ! I think I could actually pull off this craft : ) I 'm not that great with the pottery stuff . Love the white and bold picture as well . Anthro looking : ) Thanks so much for hosting the party . I just linked up . <p> Inspiring , indeed thank you , Kate . Not anyone could smack a homemade clay flower on a finished vase and have it look good , yknow certainly not moi ! Its a testament to your talent that your result was so professional and polishedand speaking of polish I was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your flower ( not your nails too time-consuming I hear ) to capture the same sheen as the vase or did you make a conscious decision not to put sheen on the flower because you liked the differing textures or do I need to dust off my laptop screen because there is a sheen on the flowerwondering in Washington <p> Oh my word , that is just beautiful . Gosh , you constantly impress me with your talents . I admit that I can not even think of this one to try yet . Because I already have such a long " got to do " list from your inspirations you post . Still trying to save money .. lol . <p> Thanks for sharing this great idea ! I love how you made your vase completely white . So classy , and it matches any decor . Just lovely ! I look forward to checking out more of the great spring projects linked up . : ) <p> I absolutely love the organic touch the flower provides to the vase . This would make an excellent project for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting . I have linked up two projects that I hope you enjoy . <p> As I was reading I was thinking about what a great project this would be for a little girls party probably a slumber party though because of the drying over night thing ! Thanks for hosting THIS party , Kate ! <p> That looks great , kate ! and I would have believed you made the vase , too ! ; ) I used that clay on a recent project too , I wrapped it around sticks to resemble antlersI thought the Crazy Crafter police were going to come after me ! You know , when you wonder if your craft crosses the line to too crafty ! ? ! ; ) And dang it , I 've been so busy at work I missed out on this party fun ! <p> Thanks for hosting , its fun to look at all these projects ! Weve got to get on something soon so well have a spring project to link up of our ownuntil then well enjoy this great collection thanks ! <p> Its beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats ! I took a sculpting class many years ago and loved it . Something about getting my hands in the clay , playing around with it and creating whatever came to me . It was great meditation in a way . Your vase is lovely and looks very professional ! I like it better than the one at Anthropologie ! <p> I 'm commenting to fill you in on the Shellac info . I am a cosmetologist and I have been using the Shellac for over 2 years . I love it ! ( but only if it is done right , with the right product ) . <p> There are a lot of products out there that claim to be " gel polish " but in my experience Creative Nail Design ( CND ) Shellac is the best one out there and you can only get it in the salon . If it is done correctly , it will last you up to 3 weeks with no chipping ! Whee ! If you decide to get it done , make sure you specify that you want the CND Shellac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Just let me know ! <p> totally OT but I know a while back you had a post about Picnik closing the guys who originally built it and funded it ( both ! ) tried to buy it back from Google but Google is not selling . They want people to use Google+ apparently ( whatever ) <p> Anyway , some of the guys who made the orig Picnik have released //www.picmonkey.com/ Picmonkey and will be adding new stuff to it . Its pretty much the same as Picnik with regards to functionality . <p> Love the vase and love your nails ! Reason , you are real . I have tried every product out there to keep my nails looking nice . Bottom line , if you do the kind of things we do , even shellac will chip ( although rarely ) but it will start to wear after about a week , especially on your dominant hand . I have struggled with this for years and still do . Then you have to figure in the cost and the time of it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I have concluded that healthy , clean nails are the ticket . Twice a week I use a good cuticle remover , pushing them back with a orange stick , and then I use a good cuticle nipper . Invest in a high quality one . I have a couple of good files and keep them short and filed on the square side . I also use a cuticle oil at night and in the morning , which keeps everything looking healthy . If I want polish , I use an Essie or OPI light pink or clear shades and do my own . If it wears , it is less conspicuous . Ive grown to become happy with this . If I 'm on vacation , shellac it is . <p> Very nice ! Ca n't wait to see what else you sculpt . The flower reminds me of something I used to do in the early 90s and I 'm not sure if the products are still out there or not . It was called petal porcelain . You would take an artificial flower and spray this petal porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial flower and would look like white porcelain . You would then paint it and add the " china flowers " to baskets , boxes , vases , wreaths , etc . Does anyone know if that product is still available ? I have n't seen it in years . <p> Thanks Kate for taking the time out of your busy days to host this linky party ! ! I love your clay vase DIY , so simple and classic you are very ingenious ! I have been reading your blog behind the scenes for a loooong time , and now am following you with GFC.what took me so long ? ? ? : D Please visit my blog and say hello sometime i love to make new bloggy friends ! Hope you have a wonderful weekend ! ! My family is going to see the Hunger Games movie tonite should be a lot of fun : ) Heather @ **27;1281;TOOLONG <p> That is such a great idea ! And super cute ! Ive been working with polymer clay for a couple of years now and I love it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clay , but I do know that with polymer clay and many other types , once you have used a tool ( like your butter or steak knife ) , it should n't be used with food or come in contact with anything you eat . Just thought I would mention that . <p> Love your clay flower ! I 'm a practicing artist who uses ceramics to make mixed media sculptures . My suggestion is to use an old pillow case ( or ideally a piece of canvas ) under your clay when you flatten it , and then it wont stick to the bench . It is easy to peel the clay off the canvas . Also turn it regularly when you are flattening it , and it is less likely to stick . Make sure you wash your piece of canvas regularly as the dust from dry clay is not good for your lungs . <p> I have pathetic nails , and with DIY around the house and sculpture in the studio my finger nails are a mess . I have used the shellac polish and found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 3 . It even held up while welding You have to find someone who uses good product and takes the time to do it properly . The problem I found is that they have to etch ( ie sand with a dremel looking thingy ) the surface of your nails to get it to stick , then add a primer , etc , etc ( sound familiar ? ) . You can imagine after a couple of reapplications that your nail starts to thin . Imagine if you kept sanding back your wood furniture every 3 weeks Anyway , I found I could get away with 3 applications , and then I had to let my nails grow out so they were thicker again . While they were growing out they looked TERRIBLE . Worse than they normally do , so I stopped doing it . <p> I will do it again for a special occasion , though . Especially as I am that girl who always dints regular nail polish because I cant sit still doing nothing long enough to let it cure properly . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who knew clay could be sensual ! Thanks for hosting the party . Im excited to see what everyone has made , because I 'm in need of some spring decor around here . <p> re manicures , i am a big fan of the peel and stick manis , sally hansen salon effects and kiss products . they are easy to apply and last for over a week and makes life easy and your nails fun and pretty ! <p> I love love love Shellac ! Agree with the cosmetologist : ONLY use Shellac , and make sure they use the CND drying lamp . My people lightly buff my nails and do n't  sand them down , so I do n't  have the problems the other poster did with it . LOVE it . : ) <p> Well , this was my first time linking and I did n't  know what I was doing : ) I realize now I should have put Recovered Loveseat instead of my name where it says name . hahaha Live and learn ! <p> I 've followed your link parties for months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too as I hop around and check out the projects that catch my eye . <p> Your vase flower is so pretty ! Not sure I can get modeling clay like that here but I 'm going to have to find out . It looks like a fun project , and I can see other uses too like a flower on top of a plain napkin ring , or decorating a simple picture frame <p> I had the CND shellac put on my nails and it lasted for 3 weeks and looked great . The problem was when they took it off . Becausethey had to file the surface of my nails before they put it on and when they took it off , my natural nails were ruined . I have always had very thick and strong nails . When the shellac was removed , my nails were very thin and weak and broke constantly . They also looked terrible . That was over 3 months ago , and they are just finally starting to grow again without breaking . I would not do it again . I guess if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , it does n't  matter if your naills look bad and are weak since the shellac would cover that . What 's frustrating is that I asked the girl if it would damage my nails and she said " no " . <p> Awesome project . I am definitely going to try out some polymer clay now . You have added something new to my " wan na do " list ! ! ! Great link party as well . I will definitely be trying some of the crafts , and I am going to be super busy reading all the blogs that I 've subscribed to as a result of this party . Thanks again for hosting such a great event ! ! ! <p> I did n't  skim all the other comments to see if this was mentioned previously , but I used Sculpey to make my Christmas gifts this year ( dishes imprinted with a doily I do n't  have a crafts blog though , haha ) and since I did n't  paint them , I finished them with a high-gloss ( air-drying ) glaze that Sculpey makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its a little vial and you apply it with a brush . It made it look that much more professional it would match the sheen of your vase . This is a great project you did ! <p> I am freeeaking obsessed with Shellac . I got OPI Axxium on Thursday of last week and I have one slightly wearing on one nail . I only noticed this because I stare at it nonstop because Im obsessed with how well it stayed . I 've heard that people can get chips after a few days but I 'm definitely doing it again ! 23102 @qwx883102

If you follow me on Twitter , you know I spent yesterday morning removing tile ! <p> A few months ago , I received a cordless Dremel MultiMax and I 've been waiting to break it in yesterday was the perfect opportunity . I realized it did n't come with the grout removal attachment so while it charged , I grabbed the attachment at my local home improvement store . <p> I always do the happy dance when I get to break in a new tool . <p> You too ? <p> Removing tile is messy and can be hazardous so I armed myself with tarps , safety goggles and some gloves . <p> The MultiMax was really easy to use the attachments come on and off with the help of a simple hex key . <p> I was especially concerned with preserving the other surrounding white tile since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth cuts , so it really helped achieve that . <p> The first few pieces came out pretty easy with the help of the Dremel . About 200 more taps of the chisel and hammer . . . <p> . . . and here 's what we were left with . <p> We had to repair some of the sheetrock that came out with the tile , so we fixed it with some patching compound and drywall mesh tape . <p> Now we have a nice clean canvas ' for the new white tile going in today . <p> Yes ! <p> Today Ramon is coming over . Ramon is our good friend . Ramon has tiling skills . Ramon has a big tile saw . Ramon will teach Kate how to cut and install tile . Kate is one happy gal ! ! <p> I 've got a few other projects I 've been working on too , ca n't wait to share . Until then , happy home improvement ! <p> I cant wait to see the final reveal ! I bet its kind of therapeutic to rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing all the pictures on your post , but the pic of the " blank canvas " was pretty cool . I hope Ramon shows you all of his tiling secrets ! <p> Thanks for reminding me and inspiring me that I can do this project myself . Ive been wanting to remove our kitchen tile since we moved in . Is the tool you used only necessary if removing partial part of the tile or is it a necessity if I plan to remove all the tile ? I 've never done this before . Thanks for your help ! <p> Thanks so much for posting this ! I have to pull up broken tiles in my kitchen floor and did n't  know where to start . Like so much on your site , I will reference this . Good luck , I cant wait to see it when its done . <p> I was just thinking that I wanted to remove the grout in our bathroom and re-grout . Is that crazy ? I actually just wanted to re-grout right over the stuff from the 40s since its icky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Did the attachment keep the tiles around it in tact ? Maybe I 'll just forget about the bathroom and tile the kitchen . It ca n't be that hard , can it ? <p> Thanks for the tips . I plan on removing my lovely avacado green back splash tile in my kitchen this summer and using the Dremel tool for the grout lines seems like the way to go . Ca n't wait to see your reveal ! <p> I LOVE tiling ! We recently did our backsplash , and did the entire kitchen/dining room in our previous house . We even got the MultiMax ! We 'd really like to redo the entry/hall/powder room in our current house but the thought of tearing out the existing tile with all of the underlayment has me intimidated . We also have accent tiles in our shower that I 'm not crazy about that I 'd love to do this to I never thought of being able to just cut them out . Poor husband , another thing on our LONG to-do list ! <p> I have n't ever removed tile , but installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it looks when it is finished . Less so because of the incredible number of muscles I learn about it . I hear tiling backsplash is a doozy : - ) You go girl . Barbara <p> Ca n't wait to see what you come up with ! We recently did our backsplash too ( but did n't  have to remove anything ) . All I had to do was follow my husband as he grouted and wipe off the grout . That was hard enough work as it is ! ! Ca n't imagine doing it all ! ! Good for you ! I 'd love to learn how to use some tools <p> I second the awesomeness of this tool . I have n't personally used it , but my husband and I built a house last year , and toward the end of a series of snafus regarding the radiant heating under the master bathroom floor , all of the grout had to be removed and redone . Thanks to this tool , the tile guy was able to take all of the grout out relatively quickly and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , but it always makes me happy to see all DIY-girls out there that are not afraid to use the tools and go for the harder part of the DIY . Its kind of sad when the guys are doing all the tool-related work and the girls just paint and add cushions , kind of . <p> Your blog is a true source of inspiration . Ca n't wait to see the after pictures ! <p> Oh awesome ! I 'm actually in the middle of removing tile myself . The small tile in the half bathroom came up easily , but the big squares are a bear . This technique will hopefully prove to be the answer . <p> Girl , you are SO brave . My mother-in-law does stuff like that to her ( beautiful ) home , too and I 'm always in awe of her " Im doing it ! " attitude . I just get sooo scared to do something to my house . But seeing you doing it to your lovely home gives me courage . As such , I 'll give my husband your blog address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess up ! ! <p> Congratulations on getting this done ! Isnt it funny how our taste can change and something we once lived can sometimes be something that we need to get out of our homes immediately . Your kitchen is gorgeous and it looks like the final touch is coming out perfectly . <p> I LOVE this ! So helpful ! I 'm moving into a new house in a week and I know I 'm going to have lots of little projects to do putting up a tile backsplash is one of them , so I 'm awaiting your next post anxiously ! Catherine at The Spring <p> What a job girlfriend ! ! Could you come over to my house and help out with a 1949 pink tile bathroom ? ? ? Caught you on the Nate show today ! You looked darling the your DIY projects presented beautifully ! <p> I bought a Dremel and am in the midst of removing backsplash tile in my kitchen .

@@99057854 @3257854/ <h> How To Paint Perfect Stripes on Walls <p> By Kate Riley November 3 , 2010 <p> As much as I love a beautiful painted wall in a single color , I also adore the look of painted stripes on walls. - They can be bold or subtle , symmetrical or varied , horizontal or vertical , but done just right , stripes are perfect for creating big impact on a budget . <p> Designing , measuring , and prepping your space for stripes is difficult enough , but the greatest frustration felt by most is taking the time to paint stripes around a room with textured walls , and then peeling off the tape , only to find uneven lines . <p> Last year , I attempted vertical stripes in my master bath with pearlescent paint. - While I loved the added shimmer , I gave up on the project because I ended up with those dreaded uneven lines. - The project has been on the back burner ever since . <p> In yesterdays post , I asked the question of how to get perfect painted stripes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Ha ! - My plan worked. - Several of you have perfected a technique for stripes and you answered the call . <p> If you 've had the desire to add stripes to one of your spaces , well hear what a few readers have to say about it ! <p> Readers Share Their Techniques for Perfect Stripes on Walls <p> " I learned this trick when I worked in a museum painting walls and wall murals. - The best way to get a crisp line is to first paint your lighter color on the whole wall and let dry for an appropriate amount of time ( or , if you 're painting stripes over an existing paint job , make sure you have the original paint color , at least enough for touch ups . ) <p> Lay out your tape lines , then seal the edges of the tape with your original color using a brush or roller. - Let dry , then paint your contrasting stripe color over that , and remove the tape while the paint is still a bit wet. - Not only will you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the original paint color , and should blend in just fine . " <p> " I have textured walls and Ive done stripes and other patterns many times with success . The key is to apply a thin coat of caulk ( the paintable kind that dries clear ) over the edges of your tape ( I just use my fingers ) . <p> This keeps the paint from leaking underneath every time I promise it works ! I 've tried every brand of painters tape out there and they have all failed me . Caulk is the only surefire way that I 've found to get those nice crisp edges on textured walls . " <p> " For textured walls I can do stripes with no problem. - HOW ? - Let 's say you 're painting gray and yellow stripes . First , you paint the gray , then you tape over the areas you want to tape off , then paint the gray paint OVER the tape , to " seal " it . <p> Let it dry , then paint over it with the yellow paint . Pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be PERFECT. - It feels sooo good to peel that tape back once you 've done all the painting and waiting " <p> " A trick I use when painting stripes is after the tape is placed I roll over it with clear glaze to seal it . After that is dry then I paint the color on top and remove tape while it 's still wet. - Hope that helps ( if you have extra clear glaze ) . " <p> " Perfect Stripes on textured walls ? - Okay I have done this many times and people cant believe my stripes on our textured walls . <p> Say it was your blue you had there and you wanted a white stripe. - First , paint the wall blue. - Let fully dry , then place your tape down. - Now here is the trick . Paint over the edge of the tape blue again -and really- get it in there. - What happens is the blue goes into the ( my technical term ) bubbles or gaps where the tape is not adhering to the walls. - Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour or get sidetracked and make it two ) . <p> Lastly paint your white stripe. - We sometimes score the tape if we are worried about how many coats we had to do ( only had to do this once when we had a dramatic color change ) . - Sometimes there may be a tiny bit of touch up , but really if you get the original color in there good . You should be a-okay . That 's it ! " <p> My tricks of the trade for texture is to jam down that tape . Literally. - To paint the contrast stripes we put up the painters tape , made sure it was truly straight ( did the " across the room eyeball test " ) , and then added some serious pressure over the tape to make sure it was adhered as tightly as humanly possible. - Then , when we painted , we painted straight on . No angles , no edging brushes , straight on . It gives the paint less opportunity to slide under the tape . <p> We let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second coat was still wet . Used latex paint , worked like a charm . No problems . I have also heard of people with textured walls putting a bit of caulking underneath the tape to seal it even closer to the wall . I was n't willing to deal with that cleanup , so I just pushed the tape down like the dickens . Worked for me ! " <p> " A couple of gals mentioned using the other color paint to make straight lines when painting on a texture . I 've done it , it works. - Another option is using paintable caulking . I like doing this because it is fast and I think it is fun to use a caulking gun ! " <p> TJ <p> " The best way to get perfect lines using tape is to brush matte medium ( avail at art supply stores ) over the lines first then cover with your regular paint. - It fills in the areas where it might bleed through and dries completely clear . " <p> Many many thanks to the readers who shared their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight. - - Are you considering stripes on your walls ? - - Do you have another tip or tutorial on painting stripes that youd like to share ? <p> **Update : - If you want to paint perfect stripes on furniture , take a peek at this gray striped dresser Ive adopted- Stacys trick and it really works ! <h> 55 comments <p> I do n't  have anything new.but would like to give an AMEN to the caulking technique . We tried it this summer on a giant horizontal stripe for my sons bedroom LONG ... It worked PERFECTLY ! ! We also used a flat paint for the walls and a semi-gloss for the stripe . It gave a dimentional look that is really cool in person ! Thanks for the fun stripe photos . I 'm seriously considering the black and white ones . They look amazing ! ! <p> Wish I 'd read this 5 years ago when I did Natalies nursery . ; ) T helped me level off the horizontal stripe for the " chair rail stripe " in green and then we leveled a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cream . I did n't  use any technique at all for the painting , and I see now that it was complete pure luck that they turned out so well ! ! ! ; ) <p> Lots of great tips here ! I have been wanting to try painting stripes in our laundry room . Now I am really inspired to get going ! I have only attmpted stripes on furniture . Loved all the images , too ! What a darling pink nursery . <p> If I had seen this post yesterday , I wouldve responded the same way . All of these suggestions are basically the same idea . I 've used the base paint to cover the tape before adding the second color . It works like a charm . I even had a professional painter tell me I do a fantastic job . ; - ) Its all in the preparation ! <p> Yay ! Im SOOOOO glad you posted this today ! I am about toas in , next weekvertically stripe my bathroom .. and the walls are textured I was just going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  have to ! : ) : ) : ) <p> I planned to paint some tone on tone horizontal stripes in my master similar to The Lettered Cottage image , but I am LOVING the Elle Decor dark/light stripes ! ! Really sharp looking ! I may have to think this through a little more <p> Where was this post on Monday ? LOL ! I was going to paint stripes in my sons Train room , but I opted out and just painted the bottom portion of the wall . I 'm going to be painting my other sons room soon , so I am going to tuck this post away for safe keeping ! Thanks for sharing ! <p> I agree with the above peeps that the caulking with painters tape is the easiestalthoughI do wish now that I would have seen the " fahgetaboutit " version . VERY ORIGINAL ha ha . I am in no way a professional , in fact these 5 stripes took me longer than 5 stripes should take a girlI was pregnant , I 'll blame it on that ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint the whole wall with my base flat paint , tape stripes using a laser level , then wipe a thin layer of spackle over the edge of the tape . I get the pink spackle that turns white when dry and paintable . Once dry , I paint the stripes using my enamel or pearlescent paint . I did n't  see any suggestions about using spackle , just caulk , so I thought I 'd throw it out there : ) <p> After painting stripes in my daughters room six months ago ( and repainting the lines over and over to clean up the edges ) , I wish I had followed the advise from Layla Palmers blog the lettered cottage- to use clear sealer on the tape edges . The expert paint associate from SW said that it was n't necessary with the new frog tape . I love frog tape , but it still bled through in places . Definitely seal the edges of your tape before painting stripes or you 'll be retouching your lines . <p> I want to give caution to painting stripes . When you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to sand over the line between the two colors all over your room . I spent days sanding a powder rooms paint lines and still can see some of the lines under 2 coats of BM Aura paint . I will not paint stripes again . Its easier to take down striped wall paper . <p> I love the look of the stripes , but I can just imagine the look on my husbands face if I told him I wanted that done : ) He does all the painting because I just can not do a very good job with it . Love the photos ! <p> I recently just painted some horizontal stripes in my living room . My hubby had a chalk string that we were able to line up and flick on a perfect chalk line . It required some painting in the lines but they look pretty awesome . The one problem ? He had used red chalk so it was a pain in the butt to wipe offstill working on it . Next time we will go for white . <p> But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original wall color ! Brilliant ! Thank you everyone ! <p> I had a friend suggest to me to buy a roll of vinyl in the color you want the stripes , and skip the headache of trying to paint even lines . I took her advice and bought a large roll of vinyl ( oracle 631 ) online for $40 and then simply applied the vinyl to the wall . It looks like I painted it and the lines are perfect ! So far no one has been able to tell it is not painted . And when I am done with the stripes , I 'll simply remove the vinyl . Best tip ever ! <p> Ive been trying to draw up the courage to paint stripes in our bedroom walls . The closest I got to painting walls was a tree mural in my sons room . Drawing freehand makes the preparation stage much easier . Anyway , here is my first decorative wall painting project in case you are curious : 23102 @qwx883102

I finally got that patch of sun I was waiting for all weekend long , so I was able to get my hands dirty with some new plantings for the front porch . <p> I replaced the dying Italian cypress with these pretty blue Potato Bush topiary trees and some Glamorama ' pansies .

Then using floral wire , twist a few of the larger branches around the wire form and secure them with floral wire leave a little room to fit a few more branches inside then clip away any excess wire . <p> Weave smaller branches in and out of the larger branches secured with floral wire to form an organic shape . <p> Leave all the tendrils flowing and natural . . . <p> . . . or embellish with ribbon and tuck in some faux Easter eggs to welcome spring . <p> How pretty !

We did some thrifting and house hunting together and we think we found a house to buy with a lot of potential , I 'll keep yall posted if it ends up being the one ! <p> We spent hours talking about design ideas and color palettes which put me in the mood to take a deeper look at color over the next few weeks , and it makes sense to start with red and work around the color wheel . Red is one of my favorite colors in fashion , but frankly my least favorite color to decorate with in the home , except in small doses or on a piece of furniture as a focal point . <p> True red is a dramatic and dominant hue that stimulates in large doses and adds a fantastic spark when used as an accent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when given a glossy sheen and paired with lacquered pieces , red is modern and fabulous . Barn and brick reds lend a cottage feel whereas berry or coral reds inject vibrancy and femininity . <p> Red paint packs a punch when used on a wall choose deep garnet and mix with global textiles for an exotic feel , or a brighter shade balanced with white for pleasant contrast . <p> If you want a piece of furniture to take the spotlight , you cant go wrong with red a glossy candy apple finish adds a contemporary vibe and a distressed finish has cottage appeal . <h> 55 comments <p> We have a red leather couch , a rug with red in it and a red ottoman that doubles as a coffee table in the family room .

For a while I was a little too into it , I had a large red sectional and way too many red accessories . I 've gotten rid of most of them and only have a few red items , but I still love a little red in my life . <p> I love red but after seeing post after post of rooms that are white I was beginning to wonder if I should paint my red rooms . My first use of red was in my powder room and I love it . I loved the color so much I painted my kitchen the same red . Since our kitchen is open to our family room and sun room I have carried the red in those rooms with pillows and valances . It all goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Red is too strong for me personally , but I am lucky because my BFF is a red lover and her home has always been Red , white and blue on the nautical side , since she lives on the water . I remember when everyone and their brother was painting red dining rooms . Very few got the right red and most repainted after 2 years so it is definitely a color you have to LOVE ! ! Happy Monday , Kathysue <p> I used to love decorating in red , especially in my " global " decorating phase when I pulled a lot of international textiles into my homebut I eventually found that red was too dark for my taste . Now I 'm enjoying lighter , cooler , and breezier tones , with just a few red accents . <p> Glad to see you 've highlighted the color red , when I feel like it often gets a bad rap . I have long loved red and use it a lot , but have phased it out of most of my house in recent years . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ottomans , a throw pillow in my boys room , and most recently bright and shiny red adirondack chairs on my deck ! <p> Red is one of the colors that really works in my house .

We have a huge fieldstone fireplace that dominates the living room . I decorate with red , dark green , dusky blues , yellow and brown . I also use iron work pieces Think Scottish plaids . My favorite decorating colors are blue and white , but it just does n't  work with this house . Its too jarring . Visitors tell us they like the sense of warmth our house gives off with this color palette . So , yeah , I 'm a fan of red . <p> I 'm in the " Red Stage " of my life .

I wish I would have gotten a neutral couch instead and used red pillows , throws , etc . Im having a hard time decorating around it ! <p> I lovED red . My dining room was red for quite a while . I have since moved away from French Country ( although I 'm really struggling with letting go of my Rooster he s ginormous and gorgeous ) anyway.I LOVE the red doors , and the buffet in the high gloss . Really diggin the cherry red accents too ! But my house is back to my first love greens and blues . ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall in the study and highlights throughout the house .

Our great room ( kitchen/dining room/living room combo ) has lots of red- red small appliances in the kitchen , red pillows/textiles in the living room , Persian rug with red accents . I refuse to use red in the rest of the house ( bedrooms/offices have more soothing colors ) , but red is fun in the big room . Neat seeing it used in other rooms that you showed . <p> I love your new photo Kate and you really do look lovely in red . My favourite colour combo is in my grey-ed teal kitchen , white cabinetry , cherry hardwood floors and just a few red accents .

I hope your new line of fabric will have some nice reds ! <p> At last ! I thought red had become extinct . Red has really received the cold shoulder as a decor colour . I have hunted the internet and looked for accent colours to use with red , as my hubby and I have recently redone our lounge in grey and red accents , but was sorely disappointed with the results .

I have always loved red and green shades . Especially the brick reds and greens with a slight teal . My house does n't  scream with the color but it is always there in spots of blending with my rooms to enjoy . <p> Love your article on decorating with red ! Although we do n't  have anything red in our livingroom or kitchen area , I did recently buy a new bedding set in red , deeper shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other bedding set . <p> I do love decorating with red but I 'm more of a " in smaller doses " girl when it comes to that . We painted our dining room a brick red color several years ago and now I 'm ready for it to go so maybe that 's why ! <p> I love red and have used hits of red in my kitchen to jazz it up . I repainted my one staircase wall in a deep red , using brushstrokes to imitate linen . A branch from our home up north ( prior to selling ) lovingly sanded by hand , stands out as a beautiful hand-railing . Everyone loves the look with my native prints , matted in red and framed in blonde wood against the red wall . Red provides a richness that I really appreciate . Cheers , from Oshawa , Ontario . <p> I do n't  love to decorate with red inside either . But , I love bright red for the patio . I found two distressed red wooden planter buckets at a flea market . I planted red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recently found a red , metal bistro set for the patio at a flea market for $30 . I 'm slowly making my patio a great spot to spend time . From Central Arkansas . <p> I love red and even more after seeing it used in so many different ways ! <p> I dig that red and white wallpaper in the bathroom , but really , I cant believe that the little 3-legged table is sitting in front of the toilet ! Its just about the only thing I see when I look at that room now ! No way this looks like this in real life . Just sayin . <p> Our downstairs game/family room has deep red ( almost claret ) walls . The deck entry floor and fireplace surround are a creamy travertine tile , the rest of the room and the guest rooms are all a dark hand-scraped wood planking . So we chose to use creams and neutrals for the upholstered pieces and drapes . The accent pillow fabrics and rug colors were chosen from the four or five biggest pieces of art work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit . I have often considered repainting , but I still love it and it works for us . I cant wait to read more as you travel around the color wheel . It is so fun to read about the variety of your readers styles . Another great idea from you ! <p> I absolutely love the chair from House of Fifty . Great use of patterns . I love the dual pattern look on furniture anyway , but the floral and polka pot pair looks amazing !

@@99057866 @3257866/ <h> DIY Wood + White Console <p> By Kate Riley June 30 , 2016 <p> Two weeks ago I decided to upgrade the media console in the house in Las Vegas , I wanted something exactly four feet wide , wood and white , with a clean modern look . After looking around at IKEA I decided to piece together some of their products to create it and include some DIY leather pulls too . <p> The idea came from all those credenza projects that have been featured around the blogosphere for a few years , the idea of wrapping white IKEA cabinets in wood is n't new but instead of floating it as a " fauxdenza " like we 've seen before I decided to make it freestanding with four legs I also purchased at IKEA . <p> To build it , Matt helped me screw the two Sektion cabinets together and wrap it in birch wood , secured with brad nails . We found -+ " x 7 -+ " birch planks at Lowes and cut the strips to wrap the sides and form the top . <p> Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online , but when I spied the Hilver table legs with the white metal top and wood base at IKEA I thought dang I 'll just cut those suckers down with a miter saw and make cute little mid centuryish looking legs . <p> The little leather pulls were so easy to make . I wanted to use white and not tan leather and it was tricky to track some down but I found a 12+12 ? piece of white leather from this shop and it worked perfectly . I also scrounged up two screws with wing nuts from my stash and spray painted them gold . <p> To make these leather pulls simply cut a 1 -+ x 10 ? strip of leather and fold it over as seen below . Lay the leather strip down on a piece of wood and use a drill bit to make the hole through it , insert the screw then secure it to the cabinet with a nut . <p> Before there was a more traditional looking media stand in this spot but its style was n't working with the modern kitchen and fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced it with this DIY wood and white console . <p> Deets on the sliding door fabric curtain here , its " the bomb dot com " as my tween daughter would say . The DIY fireplace project can be found here . You can also tour the kitchen and breakfast nook in this post and this post . <h> 10 comments <p> Looks great ! I have been wanting to make something like this but with three cabinets across . I think I would need a supporting piece on the bottom to support the middle cabinet . Anyway , I think you are local to me , for leather check out Barta Hides on Lakeville ( right before the car wash place ) . Once you get past the literal dead animal feel , they have a whole warehouse of leather hides and scraps . The scraps are by the pound and you can dig through to find whatever color and size you need . 23102 @qwx883102

For hers , I sewed an antique mother of pearl button at the xs . Since the basis for the board was a painters canvas , that was easy to do . I use regular old quilt batting and a nice piece of fabric I found in the remnants bin at JoAnn Fabrics . Both came out so cute ! <p> Loved this ! I have a narrow hall as my " mudroom " but I still did n't  have the space for something like that .

Marija ( fellow lawyer turned designer turned blogger : ) <p> I also love making memo boards , but I do it a little differently . I like to use a painters canvas from the local craft store . They are great because they are all framed in ! I lay batting , fabric &amp; ribbon and staple it all on . I use decorative buttons to anchor the ribbons and hand sew them into place right through the canvas ! I then hot glue a piece of thick interfacing on the back just to give it a finished look .

@@99057876 @3257876/ <h> Shower Design Ideas <p> By Kate Riley April 13 , 2016 <p> I have three shower remodels on my calendar right now , the first is my brother 's bathroom which I 'll be sharing in the next few weeks . The second is a client 's house down the street , they are friends of mine and we 're collaborating on a space makeover , and the third is the master bathroom in the Vegas house I 'm flipping , it 's cramped and unpleasant and I want to make it a selling point for the eventual resale . <p> Homeowners repeat the same request when they 're thinking of a shower space , they are looking for spa like conditions and a space that is relaxing and pretty to look at . We spend 5-15 minutes in this space every day , should n't it be both functional and beautiful ? <p> When it comes to tile selection , - I 've always believed you can not go wrong with a marble or marble look tile combination . I followed this philosophy to achieve a timeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a lot of it at the Kitchen and Bath Show earlier this year . I also love to see a mix of complementary tiles , perhaps a mid to large size on the walls with smaller tiles on the floor and something interesting in a niche , but really there is so much opportunity and no set rule , penny tile on the wall is just as beautiful as large scale planks . <p> I 've been focused on what makes a shower both functional and beautiful and here are a few ideas I assembled . <p> Niches . The space between wall studs is a perfect place to add a recessed niche . With advance preparation during construction or remodel , the contractor can place them strategically in the wall to create a place for shampoo , conditioner , soap etc . A wall niche is also a place to break up the spans of wall space and even add a different size tile as a feature . <p> Benches . When remodeling a bathroom with a walk in shower , consider the addition of a bench . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real estate since a bench provides seating for relaxation while the steam circulates , a place to corral all the cleansers , and for us ladies , the perfect perch for shaving our legs . <p> Windows . Bathrooms with natural light do n't feel as cave-like compared to ones without windows . Even in a shower a window can be strategically placed to allow for natural light and still maintain privacy . <p> Feature Tile Walls . The far wall of a shower is an opportunity to create a focal point in a bathroom and a place to mix tile patterns , the look is almost like a modern day mural . My brother did this in his new shower and I 'm excited to show it off to you soon . <p> Statement Shower Doors . Most of the time remodelers opt for frameless shower doors and clear glass like the many seen above , but you can also be daring and make the shower doors a focal point . How stunning are these two examples of steel doors ? <h> 19 comments <p> I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built-in benches are extremely functional and comfortable in showers ( especially for the elderly , but not only , of course ) and there 's a spa-like feel to showers with seating . I love a great statement shower door , particularly in an all-white bath ( like the last one ) . <p> Kate , We recently remodeled our master bathroom and had a 2 shelf niche installed in the shower . Each shelf is the same height . Now that we have used the shower for several months there is one thing I would change with the niche . I would have three shelves installed : 2 of equal height and one not very high at all . We have found that razors , soap and pumice take up a lot of horizontal real estate and leave a lot of empty vertical space . A short height shelf would leave the 2 taller shelves for all of the taller products . Just a thought . <p> That is a brilliant observation speaking from experience I will keep that in mind ! I have three small 12+12 niches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects take up precious horizontal space ! <p> Kristin , you 'll also want to make sure to keep a small slope to the tile when doing niches , that way the water that would normally get trapped in the corners will run out of the niche , and not behind your tile wall causing more and more problems down the road ! Having that small slope ( you should n't even notice it really ) will help keep everything cleaner as well ! <p> The problem with all of the showers you showed is they all have thresholds . My mom remodeled her bathroom last year and I insisted the shower have no threshold so it is wheelchair accessible if there 's ever the need . Its beautiful and very clean looking ! The drain is concealed . Much better than the death trap she had from the 70s with tiled steps leading to a sunken shower . <p> I appreciate you mentioning the thresholds , and it being a consideration for a wheel chair or elderly person . Can Kate comment on whether or not a threshold is actually needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . <p> I am in the planning phase of our master bath remodel ( because of mold ) and I was wondering why some showers had curbs and others did not . I asked my home designer friend and she gave me the scoop . If on the ground floor , the shower pan is typically built into the slab , allowing you to step down from the dry floor into the shower and making a curb unnecessary . For upstairs showers , you have to have a curb to accommodate a rubber membrane to hold the draining water . For ADA showers , you can go curbless if you pitch the floor if you need to not have a curb . Hope that helpsI love the look of curbless and am planning to do that with my new shower . <p> Just beginning our master bath remodel and my husband and I have been anguishing over our difference of opinion for tile . Love the idea of the focal wall since we could combine elements of both our preferences ! <p> We are currently in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . We used extra large subway tile with gray grout to really show case the tile size and built a niche with design tile for some pop . <p> Lots of great ideas but we just finished our master bath Reno . I did put in a tall niche with 1 shelf in the middle . It holds the really big pump bottles from Costco . And we positioned the niche on the side wall so its not the first thing you see when you come into the room . The contractor suggested a curb less shower and we went with it . But I wished I 'd thought about it more and how we use the shower . While I do like the look of it we cant put a shower mat outside because the door swings out and does n't  clear it like a curb shower does . The door does swing both ways but our shower controls are on the same side as the hinges . To get around this and avoid slipping on a wet floor I position the mat to the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taps and then when I get out of the shower I pull the mat over with my foot and open the door into the shower . In hindsight I couldve had the shower made without a door ! <p> Great article . Marble is such a classic . Regarding niches : please remember to put them on the non-focal wall . Your sight line wont see a mass of plastic bottles upon opening the bathroom door ( water pooling inside is a non issue then too ) . Start the shelf just 3 inches up from the bottom of the niche for razors , soap , etc . Our last two shower remodels were doorless . You would be surprised how many showers function well with only a glass wall depending upon the size . Having no thresholds is wonderful but not easy from a structural stand-point to achieve in the average home since they require pre-planning of drains , floor height , slope , etc , which affects the substructure or concrete . Planning a barrier-less shower needs to become more of the normal design of a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need to know this I have a blog question .

I 'm very excited to see the improvements as they happen and I pop in every other week to see what 's been done . I 'll be sure to share their bathroom and kitchen remodel when complete ! Since the ceilings are low ( only 7-+ feet in the bedroom ) I suggested using wall sconces for lighting instead of overhead ceiling fixtures . With low ceilings , taller people can hit their head on an overhead flush mount . <p> I love wall sconces , I have them in my dining room and family room and they 're always the ones I use in the evening instead of the overhead fixtures .

This style of sconce is also handy in a bedroom on either side of the bed since they take the place of lamps , saving space on the nightstand , they also look beautiful incorporated into the design of bookcases . <p> Proper sconce placement depends on the ceiling height and also where you want the illumination to occur . For example , in a bathroom you 'll want them placed slightly higher than an adult 's head but in a bedroom closer to the nightstand to allow for reading at night . Below are a few examples of different styles of sconces that act as functional lighting and contribute to the good design of the space because of their style and shape . 23102 @qwx883102

What a crazy weekend it was with parties and events galore , I had to take Monday off just to chill and get my groove back : ) - I 've just a few little things to pick up before Christmas arrives and I still have to wrap all my gifts but I 'm feeling pretty prepared so I intend to enjoy the twinkle lights and peppermints and all the other seasonal fun happening now until the end of the year . <p> Rather than more holiday related decor , today I wanted to take a peek at a trend I 've spied popping up in the past year . It seems still life floral wallpaper is a thing . It 's everywhere from residential spaces to commercial studios and it makes for a striking focal point as a backdrop or accent wall . To me it feels like we 're looking at an enlarged oil painting , and these prints are a fresh approach to a throwback bouquet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually getting cheaper and cheaper nowadays , as prices for printing come down , and better machines and inks make better quality prints for less than they used to cost . Plus , you can design your own wallpaper ( including this very pretty floral design ! ) 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057892 @3257892/ <h> The Quest for the Perfect Robins Egg Blue <p> By Kate Riley January 23 , 2012 <p> I spent this weekend prepping and priming a dresser for a good friend in anticipation of painting it for her daughter 's room . We 're sprucing up the space and repurposing some furniture and since the walls and daybed are white , I thought it would be absolute perfection if we painted the dresser robin 's egg blue . So off I went in search of the absolute perfect shade . <p> I adore this color so much I even use a version of it as a background on the ol ' blog . It 's that blueish with a bit of green and gray shade that in my opinion just makes the world a better place . It 's not turquoise or aqua , but not pastel or too green either . Kind of airy and watery but not as bright as Tiffany blue , and always so so pretty when done right . I 'm a total sucker for anything painted robin 's egg blue . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and I do believe it may be a real sickness because not only do I prize my collection of fan decks but I also collect paint swatches everywhere I go , especially in shades of blue and green , being my favorites and all . I ca n't help it . So I picked up a few more samples from brands I did n't have around town on Saturday and then started to narrow it down . <p> Moooo haw haaawww , my collection of paint swatches ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> See , I told you . Sickness . <p> I obsess over choosing the right paint color and I can always use a second opinion so Coco got in on the action . This one no this one <p> Here I thought she 'd be helpful but she really is so fickle . I 'm not sure she 'll make a great decorator , despite being born with perfect stripes . *sigh* <p> Over coffee on Sunday I started to whittle down my favorites and yes it 's true , I wholeheartedly admit comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These were all gorgeous , but a little too saturated and closer to Tiffany Blue . <p> Then I regrouped and started narrowing down some favorites , eliminating ones that were too green <p> And then finally narrowed it down to these five favorites : <p> Because this is the ultimate color we 're going for <p> via <p> Gorgeous right ? <p> What about you ? Have you discovered the perfect shade of robin 's egg blue ? Do you obsess over paint colors as much as I do ? Do share in a comment , I value your color suggestions , and more importantly , validation . <p> I love this post . I painted my upstairs living area robins egg blue after being inspired by a look in Domino . Ugh , it turned out all wrong . I have to wait to repaint , but the color is a little too babys room . I am going to bookmark your colors . I hope you will share which one worked out ! xo <p> Great choices , my daughters nursery is painted Birds Egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ceiling of my other daughters room . It can read a little Tiffany Blue depending on the light .. so keep that in mind for the final selection . <p> Oh Kate , do n't  do this to me , I have just chosen the color for my sons dresser . Or maybe not , that Swan Sea looks pretty . No , really , I have chosen , after spending HOURS deciding . Oh crap . Now I like thunderbird . <p> Yes Kate I do the same thingI find it very relaxing to look at paint colors.I too am odd : ) I painted my Dining room about 6 years ago and I still LOVE it . The top is Wythe Blue by Ben Moore.I love the small contrast of chocolate on the ceilingHere is a link if you want to see : ) Good luck picking LONG ... <p> You are correct , that dresser is perfectly gorgeous ! Blue is one of my favorites too . In fact , my bedroom in my previous house was the perfect shade of sky blue . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chosen the perfect color and had it all over the walls but afer sleeping with it one overnight I decided it was too " circusy . " My paint guy still teases me about thatcircusy . He will ask me almost every time I get ready to buy paint " this is n't circusy is it ? " I finally found a swatch of fabric and took it down there and had it computer matched . Why do n't  you do that with this picture ? Sometimes there is just no other wayyou have to create your own color . Good Luck ! <p> I painted my home office exactly as that blue kitchen in the House Beautiful picture you have Benjamin Moores Woodlawn Blue on the ceiling and I love it . What was ironic is I found out my mother had painted her living room the same exact color back in 1977 ! <p> I found the perfect shade of Robin Eggs blue to be Celtic Gray ( I think its by Valspar , but when I went to fetch my swatch , I could n't find it agh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but definitely not gray at all its on my bedroom walls &amp; I love it ! <p> Wow you have a lot of paint swatches . I certainly obsess when picking a color , I just want it to be right the first time , ya know ? I also do n't  want to repaint or have to buy more paint . I love all of your 5 choices . In my opinion 4 &amp; 5 seem lighter with an airier feeling . And 1 &amp; 2 seem more saturated with color . I think 3 might be a nice middle ground and might be close to the color you are looking for . I 'm wondering if on any of the sources they shared their paint choice ? Anyway good luck , I do hope well get to see what you chose because I would like to have the perfect robins egg blue on hand ! <p> I painted my daughters room Watery a couple of years ago after going through countless samples . I love love love the end result though ! It did end up being just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being closer the what the Birds Egg card in your picture looks like on my computer . Definitely brighter than the dresser , although I assume that has a dark wax finish over it anyway . <p> Robins Egg Blue is my FAVORITE color . I have it in touches all over my home . Anything in that color makes me stop in my tracks . YesI do obsess about picking the right color . Often as soon as I decide and start painting , I actually panic that I picked the wrong color . For the most part I love what I have chosen as soon as I finish all of the walls . I just painted my new home gym ( which I revealed this morning on my blog ) in Palladian Blue . Its one shade lighter than Wythe Blue which was a bit too saturated for a home gym in the basement with little natural light . The Palladian Blue was perfecta gorgeous blue/green . I hope you will check it outI completely value your opinion . <p> Oh my gosh , I love playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-to colors ! But I think in the end , there is not really just one perfect color . I 'm sure any number of them would be perfect ! <p> Just wanted to throw one more tried and true color your way .. and I think I actually saw it in the top left of one of your photos .. American Traditions Signature- Peaceful . Beautiful color ! ! ! More blue than green but enough green/grey to give it sophistication . All the ones you mentioned were very close contenders for me as we painted our master bedroom but they all some value I was n't completely happy with . I finally settled on this one and I could n't be happier ! ! <p> I will be using it to paint a dresser turned craft storage chest in the next few weeks , myself ! <p> Ive been on the quest for this perfect color too , so I 'm glad to see this post ! I agree , there 's just something about that color that makes a room smile . Swan sea seems like it may be too dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to bounce off it ( quilt , accessories . ) . I would bring the swatches in the room next to any other accent colors to see which one works best . <p> Kate , I love this color also . And the shades youve selected are so elegant-fun . I do think the last dresser you said you were aiming for looks very different from the prior examples . The first ones are so clear and the latter is more muddied . But boy are they beautiful ! <p> I have not found the perfect shade of robins egg blue , but I do go crazy over paint colors . The colors you narrowed it down to look great , but of course until you actually test the paint you cant tell for sure . Love the color choice though . Good luck and please share your final decision ! <p> Hi Kathy , yep considered Duck Egg , it seems a little green and intense for what I 'm going for but I suppose I could whiten it with Old White . not sure I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these considerations ! Kate <p> I had to just laugh when I read this Kate because you are not alone . I 'm the same way and I tell my husband I 'm just " hyper color sensitive " . LOL ! The people at the paint store hate to see me coming because I get in the back with them and tell them that I want 50% this color , 25% of this and 25% of that ! However , it usually pays off and I get exactly what I 'm looking for Eventually ! Ha ! A trick I use if I find a color that is just a tad off , like too blue and I need a little more green to off set , I will find a second close color that may have just a tad more of the green and have the colors mixed 50/50 and I get closer than I can find on a card . Half of my house is this crazy custom mix ! Good luck girl ! <p> Paint swatches make me happy . Is that weird ? I love that you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good apprentice yet . Love the ceiling in that House Beautiful shot ! I think you did a good job narrowing them downthats one thing I am not good at-making the choice ! <p> Delicious post ! I firmly support your swatch collecting and admire your collection ! Sickness no way ! A tool for creativity ABSOLUTELY ! Call me an enabler if you must but I *love* your blog , your decorating , your style so getting a glimpse into your method of choosing that perfect shade is inspiring ! I cant wait to see the finished product : ) <p> That pile looks just like the one that I had while narrowing down the color for our home ! <p> We went with option number 5 BMs Birds Egg . I love it and we a ton of compliments on it . We used it in our living room and hallway so it is the first color you see when you walk into our house . It is also the color of our front door . <p> I love paint swatches , I go to the paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I am working on a project or not . I love BM blues , I have found them to always have exactly what I am looking for . I have also had good luck with having my colors matched with the fabric I have to have . I love your blog and your projects always inspire me ! . <p> YES ! ! ! Only obsessed is n't my wordfreaked out by it , is mine . I have made some mistakes before and for some reason those memories are more powerful than the GREAT paint decisions Ive made . I want a robins egg blue for my bathroom right nowPLEASE let us know what you decide ! ! Checking out the other suggestions too . psI love that dresserseems I eyeballed it once alsois it Ballards ? ? love it ! ! <p> There needs to be a paint color choosing support group somewhere . I do the same thing obsess ! Right now I 'm trying to choose a color that will coordinate with my 10 yo sons Bruins fathead we are trying to compromise on color b/c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I have Ben Moore Wythe blue in our FR and Love it ! ! <p> I love these blue-greens too . I confess I spent a year thinking about the paint color for my bedroom . I went with BMs Woodlawn Blue and I love it ! People walk in and say , its such an incredible color ! I try very hard not to tell them how long it took me to choose it . We will soon be moving , luckily , I already know what color to paint the next master bedroom . <p> Oh , I soooooo understand . I usually try for just a sample or smallest amount possible . Go home home paint part of a wall or two and wait . Look at it once it is dry . Check out how it is with the light for that particular room , etc . If it takes several trips to the paint store so be it . I at least know I gave it my best shot . I also think blue is toughso many shades , getting it just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to pain a very light blue , also . I have been procrasinating and collecting paint chips . : ) I am jealous of those people who can look at the color and start mixing/adding colors on their own to get just the right shade . I can see that it needs to be darker or lighter but can not see what colors to add . I have a friend who is great at it . <p> I just painted my living room this weekend in , what I think , is the perfect " Robins Egg " blue . The color is Glass Tile from the Valspar Signature line at Lowes . It came out perfectly ! Now I cant wait to accessorize ! <p> Yes ! ! ! My favorite color ! ! I painted my laundry room and a wall in my living room Comfort Gray by Sherwin Williams ( SW 6205 ) . It is a perfect light grayish aqua and I stole the idea from The Nesters front sitting room . My sons room is Frozen Pond by Behr ( UL220-15 ) which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swatches I think I 'd go with Watery . Ca n't wait to see the dresser ! <p> The quest never ends ! ! ! I 've seen many awesome rooms/projects that used BMs Birds Egg , so that gets my vote ! But I 'm saving this post and know I will be sharing it with many , many people ! I get so many emails from people wondering about the perfect robins egg blue ! <p> One of the first things after moving into my home was to paint my armoire robins egg blue . I absolutley love it . I picked out a color that was a little too saturated , so I ended up mixing some white with it to tone it down . But it turned out lovely . <p> We went with the SW Meander Blue in our bedroom . We love it . We get compliments from everyone that comes over . We went back and forth trying to find one that was n't too blue or too green . All of your narrowed down colors are beautiful . Good luck and cant wait to see the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robins egg blue to Tiffany blue . I recently painted a Salvation Army found dresser in a pale pale grey blue to coral all my craft supplies . When I got one coat of the pale paint on the dresser , realized it should be blu-ier and retinted it with some blue and black craft paint . Perfect ! One of my favorite colors ever . <p> I absolutely love that first pic from Morgan Harrison Home , with the dark blue painted ( ? ) floors and the buffet in a lighter shade . *Swoo-oon* I searched for the perfect light/robins egg blue for my guest bath and ended up a little brighter than I wanted with all the walls done . Lately I have been obsessing over Navy blues as well . Ahhh , blue . Great post : ) <p> YES . I agree I obsees over the right color which is WHY I have n't painted my living room yet not sure what to match with my wood trim and there are SO few inspiration photos showing wood everybody has white painted trimbut I just cant do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and I swer I spent a month or more picking the color , and now that all the walls are done it is TOO blue . I still love it , but too blue thinking of maybe a wash over top , POSSIBLY ? What will you do on the dresser to get the grayish sheen over the blue paint , like your inspiration dresser ? THANKS FOR SHARING ! ! ! Julie <p> Your kitty is so cute ! ! ! I can not wait to see this dresser revamp ! I love that we finally realized we can paint furniture any color we want ! Makes things fun ! ( Yes , I used an exclamation point to end every sentence . I 'm working on it . : D ) <p> I am totally obsessed with this color as well ! My favorite is the Watery from Sherwin . I like a little more grey undertone in it . I love the idea for the dresser ! ! I am contemplating painting a dresser of mine so I am excited to see how yours turns out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint colors are totally an obsession ! It is such a commitment ! ) <p> thanks so much for your color info . i wanted little guys room to be that very color , and in my haste chose something ( i have no clue what it is ) because the painters was buying paint within the hour . oh well.we still have the blue up and i rather like it now , although the dresser at the end is FABULOUS ! <p> Oh Lordy.I did the SAME thing this weekend looking for the same blue . Admittedly , I had fewer paint chips to start withI love Martha Stewart Aegean Bluewhich is a tad greener . When you find the " right " one.please share ! <p> I totally obsess over paint colors . You should see my office right now with about 25 paint swatches taped to the wall and even a few " test colors " painted directly on the wall . I am looking for the perfect light green with a little sage , but not too much . Must coordinate with a sky blue type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were painting my daughters room this weekend and she is sure about her colors , but I 'm not lol . I still keep looking at more of them and she keeps sticking to her guns . <p> I worry about using the wrong color too , but not quite as much as you do . However you probably almost always get the exact color you wanted so maybe I should start obsessing like you do . LOL ! Out of your final 5 I think swatches #3 and #4 match the dresser the best . #5 is my favorite but it looks like it may be a a little brighter than the dresser , but it could all be my computer monitor . I do love that color blue ! <p> I 've found that every time Ive obsessed over swatches , I 've ended up HATING the color I picked . The paint colors in my home that I love , even years later , are the ones where I said " I think I 'll paint the insert room today " and then stopped into Lowes , picked a color on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the swatch to see it in daylight . Never again will I bring a bunch of swatches home and screw around with them . It never works for me ! <p> OoH ! I love 3 . Watery by sherwin williams ! ! AH ! I have been looking for that perfect blue to ! I have two of the same antique dresser you painted white and had by your stairs . I have to do this ! I cant wait to see it ! <p> I LOVE the background colour of your blog ! ! Even tried to colour match it for my laundry room ! ! I too am obsessed with this colour and although I 've only painted the laundry room in this colour evreything else in the house is accented in this amazing colour . I cant resist buying a vase or bowl in this amazing colour . As for your obsession with paint chips , I totally relate cant pass the paint chip isle in any home improvement store I visit ! ! <p> I agonize over paint color too , we often purxhase 5-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can say now though , that we are WAY better with all the practice . We rarely bring home a horrible color and the last 2 I bought.only took one try ! <p> I love the SW Watery . Soft and lovely . My go-to color is usually RH Silver Sage . It reminds me of SW Watery . <p> When I was a kid my mom used to stare at paint swatches , trying to figure out which whites ( of all things ) to put together . I thought she was nuts but now I totally do it too . You 're not alone . I have a collection of my most favorite swatches and my cat peed on them this summer ( she had recently experienced physical and emotional trauma in the form of a dog attack ) . It was a little bit heartbreaking . <p> Ha ! I did this very same thing yesterday ! Only I was obsessing over the perfect off white . When I showed my hubby he said " they all look the same ! " To which I gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Btw-our bedroom is a robins egg blue ( forget the exact name , but it is Behr ) . I LOVE it ! <p> I have never searched for the perfect robins egg blue so i do n't  have one to offer at this moment . I too obsess over paint colours when it comes to my own home . I am awful thinking about it day and night painting swatches all over the place asking my husbands opinion only to disregard it . I get sick to my stomach rolling on the floor over the agony of colours for SOME rooms . Ok just really this one time but it had me totally flustered . That 's why I painted most of my house white . but even that took come consideration . When it comes to picking out colours for others homes clients , friends or family its a cinch . Does n't  stress me at all . <p> Robins Egg Blue is one of my all time favorite colors , especially when paired with white , so loved your inspiration photos . <p> I too obsess over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up mixing my own custom shade when I could n't find a sample paint that was just right . I have used SW Watery though , in my friends sun room . Its gorgeous ! I used SW Raindrop in my childrens bathroom ( its one shade darker than Meander Blue on the color strip ) , and it was VERY blue once it was on the walls . I actually kind of wish I had gone with Watery in there too , but its a kids bathroom , so bright is okay for now ! <p> Dude I just painted my kitchen the SW Meander Blue and I love it . I , too , am a blue-green-aqua freak . This weekend I just picked up a gray-blue called Lighthouse for my sons bedroom . I am sure that left to my own devices every room in our house would end up some shade of blue . <p> BTW Ive also noticed that your trim color makes a big difference in how a blue looks . The meander blue looks really bright against our oaky trim but it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My favorite in your top 5 is Watery by Sherwin Williams . The gray undertones make it a bit more sophisticated and might withstand the test of time as she matures . I absolutely love the gray/blues too . My husband and I convinced our landlord to paint our bedroom Beach Glass by Benjamin Moore . One of my favorites ! ( Yep , still renting , but have an awesome landlord so its ok . ) <p> Good luck with whichever color you choose . Ca n't wait to see how it turns out ! <p> I love Birds Egg ! It is so , so pretty . My boys bedroom is a custom Benjamin Moore mix . I find that it looks just like the Birds Egg paint chip , where the actual paint is a bit more powder-y . Love all of your choices ! <p> I 'd bet good money that you go with Watery if you are looking for an exact match ( though perhaps that inspiration piece has an under-color ? ) or Swan Sea if you want more punch for your buck . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually painted our guest bath that color three years ago ! Its definitely much darker dry than in the photos you have as inspiration above but its a gorgeous color ! ! Good luck making your final selection : ) <p> I wanted a grayish greenish blue for my powder room and ended up with Behr Celtic Gray . Its not gray at allmore blue than anything . I love it ! The room would be perfect if I could convince my husband that we really need to paint the ceiling , too . <p> I mean , how can you go wrong with any one of those . I do have to say though , that #5 seems to be named perfectly . It has just the right amount of blue , green , and grey in there . Love it ! I was looking for the same color when we did our Board and Batten project because that color up against all that white is Amazing ! We ended up with something close from the reject bin . Momma likes $4 ! <p> I have to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one at the very bottom of the first swatch picture on the paper . The smallest one at the bottom Ca n't read the words but i think its purdy . I love the dresser in the last photo . I think it has the perfect saturation not too to soft as I get board with pastels <p> I need to join the club on obsessing over paint colors and collecting paint chips ! A girl can never have too many ! Robins egg blue is one of my favorites.actually I think it is my favorite . I wont recommend any colors . It looks like you and Coco have it covered . Quite a cute helper you have ! <p> We painted our master bedroom in BMs Beach Glass , with BMs Healing Aloe ( which is blue , not green ! ) on the ceiling . I was trying to coordinate with Pottery Barn Porcelain Blue bedding , and I just LOVE the results ! <p> Nice choices you have there . If that dresser was in my house , I 'd never be able to leave her side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its far , far easier to select color for my clients than for myself . That must have been a tough selection , those colors are all so beautiful and at one point , although you look for nuance , you ( at least I ) have to say , either one will work if I 've put such quality time into it . I 'm convinced , too , that color choices are also somewhat arbitrary depending on ones mood at the moment ! <p> This is my favorite color , my bathroom is painted Sea Sprite , I have accents of aqua in my office and dining room . I love greens and blues ! ! I have two boxes full of paint swatches , I just went thru them to throw away all the colors I would never use in my own home ( reds , yellows and oranges ) . I love your website ! ! <p> I love them allbut partial to Meander . I agreeI would n't be able to part with her ! Kinda like running a pet shelter.I would take them all home with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hee Thanks for the great postlove following you . <p> Love the color of the dresser in the last photo . Robin egg blue is beautiful , I do no have any walls painted that color , but would love a piece of furniture or the back of a bookcase or cabinet that color . Let us know which one you choose . <p> Being that you are asking , I vote for " Birds Egg " by Benjamin Moore . I find myself obsessing over colors too .. but then I just take the leap , or now I use " just jump " ( got this phrase from a great blog story , Thistlewood Farm ) .. I find that the more opinions I get , the more confused I become .. so " just jump " and go with your heart ! <p> Birds Egg looks wonderful . LOL ! We all have our little obsessions , do n't  we ? Paint is so challenging . Last fall , when we refurbished our guest bathroom I wanted a graylike blue , there are more shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London Fog , Benjamin Moore , but I always feel its a roll of the dice . That is , until I started paining an 18 ? x 18 ? drywall board with the color I thought I lovedit really helped to visualize an actual sized sample . Ca n't wait to see your friends console . Karen <p> #4- Meander Blue from the photo looks very close to the color you 're looking for . #2- Watery would be my second choice . Each of the colors you chose actually are in the final piece of furniture pictured . Of course photography can be tricky too , changing the color value by making it look darker or lighter . <p> I am very obsessive about color . I have a tea cabinet that I 'm not done painting , but just slapped a black coat on it to hold me over till I have time to paint it as I want . My nightstands I 'm obsessing over right now . I do n't  know which way to go as far as the color is concerned . When I get like this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until that epiphany comes when I wake up in the middle of the night from a dead sleep and say " YES ! OMG why did n't  I think of that color before ? " LOL : ) <p> I love Watery from your swatches the best , but all of them look beautiful and if you 're going to glaze over it , maybe one of the lighter ones would be better. ? . <p> I have drawers full of color swatches and fan decks ! All in my quest to find the perfect blue-gray ( more blue than gray ) for my bathroom . I gave up for awhile and painted a neutral ( boring ) tan , but I still long for that blue . Everything Ive tried is either too bright ( baby blue ) or becomes too dark when I try to gray it down . The ceilings are slanted , so to keep it simple , I want to paint the walls and ceiling all the same color . That causes the problem with the color becoming too dark- any suggestions ? : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent wall . Or maybe I 'll go for a deep gray Decisions , decisons ! As for your ultimate colour , I think a patina was applied over the base colour . Do you agree ? It would make your search even more difficult Good luck ! <p> What fun ! I had a heck of a time when I was choosing a blue for our armoire over a year ago ( this post //akadesign.ca/ ? p=1944 shows the change the room has TOTALLY grown up since then btw . New floors , shelves , etc ) . I finally chose Beauti-Tones Quayside ( Home Hardware ) . It does n't  have much green in it , but it looks really pretty ! Good luck choosing , Kate . xo , Shannon <p> I love Sherwin Williams Watery . I used it on the backs of my white bookselves in the Living Room . BTW If you would like larger samplesyou can go online to sherwinwilliams.com and order 8+10 swatches and they will send them to you for free ! Its a fantastic way to get a better feel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant wait to see the results ! <p> I think any of those colors would work well for the desired effect . I just always have to remember to pay attention to paint performance of particular brands . The other thing I always seem to struggle with is the difference made by the color of the light in the room , and the color of the wall and other things that will be around the piece . ( It seems that every time I change a lightbulb in my kitchen , my cabinets change color like a mood ring ! ) <p> I have used both Sherwin Williams Watery and Meander Blue ! So funny ! ! One was in a big room with lots of windows , and the other in a small bathroom , and I can not remember which one I did where . But both turned out great In the past , on a few occastions , I have really botched the color selection process for my walls , so now I spend days/nights , weeks , sometimes even seasons choosing just the right color for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my walls for a long time before I choose . I also have a love of a Sherwin Williams color Tidewater . It turns out lovely everytime ! <p> Beautiful blues . Seems like I always am attracted to light blue . I call it sky blue . If I cant find the blue color I want , I have them tweak the paint color til I am satisfied . I have a stash of paint chips . I was planning to paint one wall so I narrow down the choices and set up the color chip so I can see it for days or weeks in different light ( sunshine , cloudy , incadescent , shade , etc . ) I choose pastels because they make things look lighter , softer . I am sure the kitty helps to set the tone and ambience . Such a cute kitty ! Right now , I 'm working on an art project . First choice was light blue background with vivid white letters . Beautiful . I so enjoy your website . <p> I love Robins egg blue . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had 1950s white flat front cabinets with stainless appliances . Have you checked out Silver sage Restoration hardware ? ? One of my new faves <p> i have been on the same quest for a few years now this is my favorite decorating color : ) i 'd have to say we just moved into our home this summer and painted our living room and dining room marthas enamelware. perfect robin egg blue for me , anyway . good luck ! : ) <p> I think Wyeth Blue is Benjamin Moore but I could be wrong . Its so nice to hear that someone else has the same addictions that I do . I am constantly collecting paint chips and writing down paint names and numbers . My daytimer is full of yellow sticky notes . You might consider Rainwashed by SW . It is light but really nice . <p> I went and picked up a ton of these swatches today and if you are going to antique it , Meander Blue might be better than Watery . I love Watery but think it may look to muddydont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BM Egg blue . Ca n't wait to hear what you choose . Now I 'm trying to pick my perfect blue for our master bath .. hmmm either Watery or Celtic Gray ( Behr ) <p> Ooh- these are lovely , too ! Ive been staring at the paint chips for the robins egg blues you suggested to me a week ago , and keep changing my mind . : ) I think I 'll have to head out and gather these paint chips too . They are lovely , and that last dresser is dreamy ! ! ! ! <p> You simply MUST watch this video clip from and old Cary Grant/Myrna Loy movie , " Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House . " Myrna Loy is describing the paint colors she wants in her house . Love the ending ! I thought of it as I read you quest for the perfect robin egg blue . <p> Great post ! I TOTALLY obsess over paint colors as much as you do and have been on a year long quest for the perfect grey for my guest room and only settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I LOVE Robins Egg Blue and think you cant go wrong with BMs Birds Egg . cant wait to see the final product ! <p> I 'm addicted to paint much to my poor husbands dismay . I never go into a paint shop or home improvement store w/o checking out the " oops " cans and usually come home with 1 or 2 . As to your paint choices above I love them all but especially like number 4 . <p> I have to admit when I read the title of your post today I got very excited ! I get compliments all the time on the wall color in my kitchen ( white cabinets ) which is BMs Glacier Lake . It does not look like much on the swatch but is magic on the wallsloved it so much it is also in my dressing and bathroom too . I have been known to carry my color swatches when shopping to match shades for future use . Another good idea is to order a free color sample of painted furnishings from catalogs P.S. I actually found a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BMs st. lucia teal 683 . <p> kate , do you have a Porter Paint there ? i too have looked high and low for a beautiful robins egg blue . after visiting a friend and admiring the paint color in her home , i begged for the name . its called Autumn Aqua by Porter Paint . i think they can match it anywhere since there 's a color code thingy online . : ) i now have it in my sun room , work room and my bedroom . if i had my way , i 'd paint my entire house in this color . its soo soothing . : ) good luck on finding the perfect blue for you . : ) laurie <p> I think the BM Birds Egg is the right one . It stood out to me in picture below the picture of Coco helping . Of course , you know the best way to decide is to buy a quart and try it first . That dresser in your final picture does n't  look like its a solid blue . It looks as though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking out a ton of paint chips to pick a color . For our kitchen , I brought home dozens of chips , and kept ruling out different ones until I got down to four . When I got it down to four , I taped the chips on the wall and then let Jim pick the color he liked best when looking at them on the wall . He did n't  pick the one I was leaning towards , but it turned out to be the best color . It was more clean than the color I thought I wanted , and I know I 'm a lot happier with it than I would have been with the other . <p> Looks to me like the Benjamin Moore Birds Egg is right on for the color you 're wishing to achieve . I like your process of elimination . I have been trying for the last 6-8 months to find the right shade of a " grayed out lavender " . Just when I think I 'm getting close and finally try a jar of sample paint , Im astounded by how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had thought it would . I 'm about to give up ! I think Ive obsessed over it for so long now that I would n't know it if I saw it ! Good Luck ! <p> Just LOVE your blog ! You just solved one of my painting dilemnas . Ive been on the search for the perfect robins egg color too . I have a long dresser like the one you show last and now I know what color to paint it . Now to find the time ! <p> Thank you so much for the intensive research , I find this blue is the hardest to define , sometimes a little too gray , other times a little too green . I have to admit I am a Benjamin Moore girl , so I usually go for the Birds egg blue . <p> Hi Kate , My sister and I embarked on the same search when painting her master bedroom a while back . We painted her room and the en suite bath with the Robins Egg from Benjamin Moore and were really happy with the result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to give you the closest match to the chest in the photo . It may be a little too blue Meander Blue may be a better fit for furniture . <p> I tend to copy nature whenever I can . My favorite time of the year is autumn . I cant tell you the 1000s of photos I have of autumn colors ( greens , golds , reds , browns ) . I am in the process of redecorating &amp; organizing my " new " office space . It was my sons room but then he took over the basement family room where my office was located . <p> Right now the colors are purple &amp; blue ( good lord what was I thinking when I painted his room ) ! I cant stand it anymore ! So I 'm looking for a sagey green &amp; a chocolate brown . I found the brown , that was easy . Finding a green that 's not too yellowish or blueish is going to drive me virtually insane . <p> So I resorted to looking at 1000s of photos searching for the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I found itmaybe . <p> I have a desk I refinished , very close to the dresser picture you posted last we used Martha Stewart Egg Shell , in River Mist . I put a slightly black glaze finish on it and love how it turned out . I also used that color in my living and we have gotten so many compliments on it ! Best of luck to you ! <p> I 'm new to Pinterest and would love to pin your photo of your top five Robins Egg blues but cant get it to work . Do you somehow have it blocked from pinning ? If not , does anyone have any idea how to ? <p> I recommend that you abandon the search for the PERFECT Blue , and SURRENDER to the ENDLESS sea of blues for the rest of your life ! I search only for the NEXT RIGHT BLUE ( knowing full well that the range of sublime shades will tantalize me once again as soon as the project at hand is completed ) . <p> I 've got the same array of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of painted blue things around , and am still pining for more blue . For one thing , the LIGHT hitting a particular object changes the color and the experience , so the same " bird egg " blue in different locations has different results . <p> Despite owning multiple teapots , yesterday I bought ( $6 ) a perfect oval teapot in the most seductive celadon blue glaze . I tried to resist but was overcome . And I accept it ! <p> I think I love Thunderbird by Benjamin Moore the best ! I am trying to get the courage to paint a Pottery Barn dresser ( it is black ) . It is scary to paint an expensive piece ! I need to read through your tutorials again of painting furniture : ) <p> I did the same search this summer and agree with a lot of people , Benjamin Moores Birds Egg is a great color . I 'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can paint the interior of our back door this color . <p> I took a robin shell I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of the perfect robins egg blue . I found that Benjamin Moore " hazy blue " is the perfect matchin eggshellof course . I have a few other very pretty pheasant eggs that I have purchased for craft purposes and intend to find the perfect match for them as well . I think bird eggs provide some of the prettiest colors in nature <p> My living room and kitchen are painted in Sherwin Williams Quietude and I think it is the perfect color . In the mornings it looks more blue and in the evenings it looks more green but it always has that grayish undertone that just feels peaceful . I have gotten lots and lots of comments and know of at least 4 other families who have painted the same color all over their house . Just love it ! <p> I am on the hunt for a great shade of grey for my living room , i love the grey color on wall of your top pic above in the dinning room . Can you tell me what color that is , and what brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite colors you have to check out . I use this for ceilings . Palladium Blue by Benjamin Moore . And then a darker shade that I have in my kitchen is their historic color , Homestead Green . That is a bad title for the best blue ever . It will surprise you . Its not green at all . I 'm like you , obsessed with colors that remind me of the ocean and a collector of paint colors and fan decks . I love how the dresser ended up . <p> I did a lot of painting entire basement , 2 bedrooms , 2 baths and entire hallway up and down to sell my house in the Northeast and a lot of painting the minute we moved in here in the Coastal South . The same color can read very differently in different parts of the country . Behr Celtic Grey and Dockside Haze looked wonderful up north . I had the colors mixed in Martha paint for better coverage . When I sampled those same colors on my walls here in the South they looked pastel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher grade of paint here since it was for me this time not to sell . <p> For my new house I went with a combination of Benjamin Moore Palladian Blue in the great room to lighten it up just the most perfect soft aqua grey color . Wythe blue was the color of the year last year for BM . It really is a sophisticated blue-green-grey . I used it for my entry hall , stairwell and upstairs sitting room . Finally I used BM Grenada Villa on a gallery hallway that bisects the house . This is a deep color in the teal green grey range and will look dramatic with paintings hung and lit . I am very happy with how it all turned out . My painter will only use Benjamin Moore for a whole host of reasons , not the least is which saving on labor . <p> Love your blog ! I painted the walls in most of my home River rock by Behr . It has the perfect amount of grey in it so it does n't  look like baby blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they can use it too . <p> My all time favorite paint colors are Ellen Kennon Full Spectrum colors ( www.ellenkennon.com ) and the best blue color is called " h2ahh " ! ! ! My open plan living/ dining/sunroom are painted in that color and it is YUMMY ! ! ! <p> For me. the perfect Robins egg blue is to find an vintage Wedgwood Drabware coffee or tea cub with the drabware brown on the outside and the great robins egg blue inside . I think your best bet is the top color of the last five . Painted one room Martha Stewart Mourning dove and the ceiling is MS Mineral Green . ( old paint ) <p> Okay , so I found a Robins Egg in the front yard and in my quest , decided to bring a piece in to match to my swatch book . I ended up with Sherwin Williams Raindrop ( 6485 ) which is one tone darker than your Meander Blue selection . I think we have the right stripjust need to decide the value for our project . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherwin Williams halcyon green . It is the closest I have ever found . Keep in mind that the new cfl bulbs will make a huge difference in how these appear . No one color will be perfect for every lighting situation . <p> Can anyone tell me what the comment meant from the person who had it mixed 25% . I am not seeing what I want in a lighter color of Robins Egg Blue and am wondering if she just lightened it by 75% ? I still want serene and quiet for my bathroom , but there are no windows and so I do n't  want too intense or too dark . Suggestions ? Thanks ! <p> I do obsess over colors , and my latest is robins egg blue . I thought I was close enough when I painted the chair rail in my kitchen Covington blue by Benjamin Moore . However , my walls are a neutral tan color and the chair rail looks way to light and pastelly for my taste . Now I want to find a way to mix in another shade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought my kitchen was finally finished ! <p> I was sitting with paint color samples on my lap while looking for the perfect shade of Robins Egg Blue , when I stumbled onto your site . I had to laugh as you described what you go through before narrowing down your choices , because you were describing me . I have colors taped all over a wall ; I want to put wainscoting paneling from ceiling to floor in my bedroom , painting them Robins Egg . I 'm so nervous about actually doing it . Has anyone else done this ? Thank you for any comments . <p> Let me just say this is the best paint color site I 've found . I 've looked everywhere for the perfect greygreenblue/turquoish paint color for a guest bedroom.I obcess over color to the point where I dream about paint color cards coming at me at different angles.There are either too light too dark too bright or not that color at all on my wall . I have spent days and days of tireless searching going from one store to another .. ahhhhhhhh .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very small and this color gives it the perfect look . However , I do n't  want to use it again in my guest bedroom . If you want a color for your bathtry Krypton SW , I have had so many people ask me what color it is ! Now back to the subject at hand .. can anyone suggest some colors I should try . I have an Eastern exposure in that room . Thanks <p> This is the best . I 'm now 23 weeks pregnant with our first child and we just bought our first home a few weeks ago . Green , yellow , and blue are my favorite colors and I thought for the longest time we 'd go with yellow for the babys room because I like the happiness of sunshine and want to share that with our baby . But then one day several weeks ago ( before we found out the gender ) it occurred to me that I really wanted to use blue . I had no idea why until one day while listening to The Beatles , I realized why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What could be better ? ? <p> So I have since been resolved to use blue . Just a couple weeks ago , we learned she is a girl and I remain more resolved than ever to transform that unappealing shade of pinkish purple left by the previous homeowner into a beautiful , beautiful blue . Just went to Benjamin Moore yesterday to get the paint for our bedroom ( Branch Brook Green ) and could n't help but spend a minute eyeing the blues for baby . I was thinking maybe Fairy Tale Blue or Serenity until I ran across your blog this morning and couldnt be happier to learn about Birds Egg . I think it might be absolutely PERFECT ! Love your writing , your kitten , your color affinities , and thank you . <p> I am painting my baby girls room and want the perfect blue to go with white furniture and hot pink accents ; can you suggest which of these gorgeous blues you would recommend . The room is small so I want to make sure its a color that makes it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love robins egg blue so much , I keep trying to fit it into my office . Or perhaps the kitchen ? Oh yes , I love it for the bathroom but it wont go with the towels I bought ( thinking they were the perfect shade ) that I 'm stuck with . Question : My bedroom is in shades of mauve and purple ( Benjamin Moore Violetta and Amorous ) and I 'm thinking of doing my office/craft room aqua . Is that crazy ? 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057896 @3257896/ <h> A Fall Wreath Story <p> By Kate Riley September 29 , 2011 <p> This is a story of a DIY project that 's kind of like a good chick flick . It opens with the main character she has a good life , a great idea , and even better intentions , but as a result of her brazen personality and wily cleverness gets herself in trouble and ends up in a miserable position which requires that she completely change her thinking . She ponders her mistakes , comes up with a simpler plan , changes course , makes amends , and in the end she gets her man . <p> I 'm not kidding , the story of my fall wreath is a scary parallel . Sit back , grab a beverage , and listen to my tale . Once upon a time there was a fair maiden who had a grand idea . Let 's call this fair maiden Kate . She had long flowing chestnut hair that glistened in the sun and in this fairy tale , she 's a Size 2 . <p> Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural grasses cue the slow motion twirling in a peasant cotton skirt to Sting 's Fields of Gold ' . The adjacent fields made her think that a fall wreath crafted out of natural grasses was a totally brilliant idea . Her source of inspiration was none other than this this wheat wreath by the reigning Queen Martha . Inspired , she wandered into those nearby fields of gold and gathered her grasses while she may . <p> Back at the castle , the maiden took her basket of glistening golden grasses , clipped them and attached them to a basic cardboard wreath form with floral wire , much like she had in the past with this lavender wreath . <p> So proud of her cleverness , she hung her golden grass wreath on her front door announcing to all the land it was time to behold its beauty . <p> And it was beautiful . <p> Kate stood back , admired her work , and smoked a cigarette in ultimate satisfaction . <p> Actually , that cigarette never happened . It was just a Hollywood producer 's attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed beautiful for a minute or two . <p> . . . until nature sought revenge . <p> Much like the bad boy in the chick flick , this wreath looked good on the outside , but in the real world , was a completely impractical choice , one that would bring nothing but pain , despair , and midnight crying on a best friend 's shoulder . <p> You 'd think our leading character would have noticed during the construction of the wreath that natural grasses being real and not faux have a tendency to do what natural botanicals do they she 'd , make a mess , and then they die . She had paid little attention . <p> Our heroine then hung her natural grass wreath with pride . . . <p> . . . but then reality set in . <p> Every time that door was opened , the result was a lot of tiny debris . Annoyingly bothersome debris in the form of little bits of grass that would get under any rational person 's skin within mere minutes . Little bits of teensy tiny grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an autumn breeze . <p> A choice had to be made . <p> Would it be maintaining the grass wreath , or would she choose the one she loved ? <p> * Dramatic pause * <p> Just so you know , this is the climax of the story . <p> Kate realized the truth , this grassy wreath was a disaster in disguise . <p> So she changed course and decided if life was worth living , a new wreath was in order . A few clearance 99 cent berry stems at the local Michael 's craft store paired with a wired wreath form was just what she needed to pick herself up , dust herself off , and a start all over again with dignity . <p> As they say , all 's well that ends well . . . <p> . . . with this simple DIY berry autumn wreath . <p> But wait ! An unexpected twist ! <p> At October 's end , I 've got this bat to suspend inside <p> . . . perfect for Halloween . <p> As you can see Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lived happily ever after . <p> ahhh gosh .. they are both beautiful .. just a tip IF you ever decide to do another natural wreath give it a few light sprays coats of matte varnish .. letting it dry well in between coats .. thatll stop the drop : ) <p> I absolutely loved your wheat wreath and was so sad to know its tragic end .. but then I scrolled down and saw that beautiful berry wreath ! ! ! ! ! ! He s gorgeous ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And a much better choice &lt;3 <p> Bravo ! I love a good chick flick . Both wreaths are beautiful , but I have to say that the less sheddy one was a decidedly better choice . I hope you are your little Storm Trooper are very happy together ! ( PS . Can you write a version in which maybe I am a blonde ? ) ; ) <p> Oh Kate I loooved your chick flick . Next time you can make a video to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; ) I realllllly love your wheat wreath , but I hate that reality had to set in ! Your berry wreath is lovely too ! ! <p> I do n't  know if it would work in this case , but my grandma used to spray cattails with hairspray ( the ozone-destroying kind ) to keep them from shedding/falling apart when she used them in flower arrangements . <p> Ha I almost died when it said you smoked then I laughed because you really did get the Hollywood reaction out of me. lol I thought the first wreath was cute but the second was a show stopper . Not personally a fan of the bat but otherwise it is beautiful ! Great story . You had me completely captivated . As per the usual . : ) <p> HA ! That was an awesome post , and very inspiring . I took out the Fall wreath I made last year and felt like it was missing something , and now I know what it is some fabulous berries ! Thanks for the idea : - ) <p> haha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress . With that drama going on ! : ) I wondered if you stopped by &amp; gathered those stalks on the way back from the airport . You have been a busy girl since I left , but I 'm not surprised . Looks beautiful , as always ! ! Miss ya ! <p> Oh Heavens ! I 'm sooo glad you wrote this ( cute story , btw ! ) cause Ive been looking at dried weeds lately and thinking I could just snag some for a little naturalness . Not after reading your post ! <p> But it was a gorgeous wreath ! You know , I should know how they preserve dried flowers Ive worked w/them enough . I know we used to use cheapo hairspray for dried hydrangea and babys breath . I mean CHEAP . Are you old enough to remember AquaNet ? : D <p> We put the cat tails forged from the stream in the back of the car and drove away with our treasure . Driving down the windy country roadsuddnely my sister let out a bloodcurdling scream . Husband almost wrecked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart attack . Coming over the backseat- a bunch of SPIDERS ! ! ! ! ! ( real ones , not plastic ones unfortunately ) . Ugly , mean looking ones too . <p> My poor husband had to pull out on the narrow road and spend the next 3 hours searching every nook for hiding black invaders while we shuddered about having to get back inside . We both had the creepy crawling sensation and nightmares for days after . <p> Better than a chick flick and I love the sci fi ending ! It truly was a beautiful wreath , but the new one is gorgeous too . I actually thought you were going to say it was full of bugs , so falling apart was a relief for me ! <p> Kate , I so enjoyed the suspenseful tale of the fall wreath-wondering if you were going to have to kick some tail in the end , to have a happy end.ing . The berries are berry beautiful and understated . I appreciate that you tied a full bow , as opposed to the half bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious full bow ! ! Its what bows were bowern to be ! <p> I am trying to attempt this myself . How many stems did you buy at Michaels ? I just accidentally bought vines which were more expensive . So I need to go back and get the stems like you did . I just do n't  know who many . Thanks for the cute idea ! <p> Oh I am so glad it was just dying leaves ! As I read the story I thought this would involve bugs . Why ? Because the boys and I made a Shaduf ( ancient Egyptian farming tool ) for school a couple of years ago . Long grass and braiding were involved . Later that night I discovered the chiggers . TWO weeks of torture later I vowed to never get in long grass again . : ) <p> Thanks for the huge laugh , I almost had an accident It reminded me of my moms attempt to include nature into the ambience of our " mobile home " when I was a kid . She had seen some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not live without cattails in our living room . As you so nicely put it , nature has its way . A word to the wise , never leave dried cattails in a room with active 8- &amp; 10-year olds . I am sure the next owner of our home is still finding cattail fluff coming out of cracks and crevices . You would have thought that Mom had thought twice about this when the original batch exploded in the car on the way home from the swampy area where she collected the first stems . No classic rock song could fit that experience . For the uninitiated , cattails , when dried , become a literal bomb of fluff similar to a down pillow . Envision a 62 Dodge Dart rolling down the road with billows of fluff flying from the windows and that was number one reason I leave taming nature to the experts like the perfect Miss Martha ! ! I was traumatized for life ! ! ! I loved your wreath ( #2 ) though . <p> Too funny ! Great idea , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did a fantastic fall folliage display with free items from my yard . I creatively arranged the folliage with a glass pumpkin filled with fall colored ribben . It was beautiful but by night it was wilted and the following morning the leaves were all shriveled up . I ended up going out and buying some of the fake stuff . <p> Love this post , and this project ! I was so inspired , I went to Michaels yesterday and re-created your wreath ! I added a small cluster of pinecones instead of a bow , and wrapped jute around an old wreath door-hanger for even more texture . : ) Thanks , Kate ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057898 @3257898/ <h> DIY : Makeup Brush Holder <p> By Kate Riley April 9 , 2012 <p> My oldest daughter is away at college and it 's her birthday this week so I wanted to send her something special for the occasion ( and something easy to ship too ! ) She mentioned she did n't have any decent makeup brushes so I made a trip to Sephora to splurge on a new set for her . While I was there I thought about something to hold them all and wanted to give her a little handmade gift to go with the new brushes . I thought a cute fabric pouch would be perfect so I stitched up a makeup brush holder with some leftover fabric remnants from my stash . <p> This was one of those projects that I made up as I went along but I tell you this , if you can sew a straight line , you can make your own too ! Here 's how I made this fabric makeup brush holder for my college girl in about an hour . <p> First grab yourself some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue medallion cotton fabric , the other a cotton duck lining . <p> Here are the measurements of fabric used : <p> First start by sewing your inside pouch . Take your first piece of liner fabric ( see diagram above ) and fold it in half . Lay it on top of the second piece of liner fabric and roughly map out the location of your brushes . They really only need to be spaced about 1inch apart , mine are 1 -+ inches in the picture below which ended up being too much but I added extra pouches in the end so it all worked out . Pin your folded over piece of fabric to your liner piece and stitch together where pinned . <p> Next stitch the individual brush pouches one by one and varying by size . Use your brushes as your guide if necessary . <p> To tie it up at the end , you 'll need some straps , so make some with two strips of fabric . To get them right side out , weave a safety pin attached to one edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It helps to press the straps flat with an iron before sewing them to the brush holder . <p> Once your individual brush pouches and straps are sewn , flip the liner + pouch inside out and layer it on top of the exterior fabric . Make sure that exterior fabric is also turned inside out so that the front of the pouch and front of the exterior fabric are facing each other . Pin and sew together , making sure the straps are sewed inside the holder , and allowing 3 to 4 inches of an opening in one corner . <p> Flip your fabrics right side out to reveal your makeup brush holder , you 're almost done ! Now it 's time to seal up your opening . <p> You can use a simple stitch on top of course ( like I did with these placemats ) or you can do a decorative edge . Ever since I got this new sewing machine I 've been dying to try out the fancy stitches so I went for it . Number 50 it is ! <p> OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along the seam was an instant decorative edge , uh-may-zing ! I used it to seal the opening shut and give the makeup brush holder a little bit of somethin ' extra . <p> You can fold up the makeup brush kit in a roll and tie it closed with the straps for travel , how fantastic is that ? <p> So that 's my step by step to making a simple fabric makeup brush holder . You can use the same technique to create a holder for artist 's brushes or pens and pencils too . <p> And now that I look at it , it 's just so darn cute I 'm thinking I 'll definitely have to make one for me too ! <p> So cool , really ! Well-organized &amp; takes least space possible ! And wow , they have all these fancy digital sewing machines these days ? The last I remember was my grandmothers machine where she rotated the wheel with one hand to make the needle work . And the ones Ive seen at tailor shops , rocking their feet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old-fashioned stuffed not sure if you 've seen those , may be in your childhood ? : ) <p> As one of the previous commentors mentioned , this pattern is perfect for knitting needles . My mom made herself one for her HUGE knitting needle collection and Ive always been meaning to copy it my needles and crochet hooks end up scattered all over the place and , inevitably , lost . Perhaps I just need to make a whole bunch ! <p> I love that stitch ! My sewing machine is pretty basic and old so I do n't  have that ability . I 'm pretty new to the sewing world but wow , I might have to look into a new one . What a great brush holder . Gorgeous fabric choice : ) <p> You 're not kidding that this is amazing ! I just sit here and drool through posts like this ( while my eyes glazed over the directions , lol ) because the one thing I do not do is sew ! Gorgeousyour daughter will love it . <p> The colors of this are just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been making something similar to this for my husbands sketching pencils , and tossing around the idea of doing one ( or several ) for my pencils , my paintbrushes , my makeup brushes lol . This one is much prettier than the one I 'm throwing together . ; ) <p> This is so stinkin cute . I am in awe of your sewing talents . You make it all look and sound so easy and I 'd have those cute straps sewn , one to my tee shirt , the other to my finger . In other words , I cant sew a lick .

@@99057900 @3257900/ <h> Computer Armoire Makeover <p> By Kate Riley August 20 , 2012 <p> We 've had this computer armoire for over ten years , we bought it when we were first married and it used to sit in the corner of our family room and hold our huge 300 CD stereo equipment and speakers , remember those days before the iPod ? <p> A few years ago we got rid of the stereo equipment we were n't using and started to use the armoire for its intended purpose as a computer station. - It 's a fantastic piece I scored on sale at Macy 's furniture store years ago , but sitting in front of it felt like staring into a cave , it was dull , dark , and unorganized . <p> This year , I 'm determined to be as organized as possible when it comes to all the activities , from school to extracurricular sports and lessons. - I thought it best to keep it all housed in one place , so the computer armoire has now become family organization central . <p> Goodbye dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all began last week in my frenzy to prepare for back to school. - I started with my favorite primer and a disposable kit which makes working with oil based products easy . <p> I spilled some all over my hands wiping up the gallon , but no worries. - I discovered years ago the easiest way to get it off is not with mineral spirits or paint thinner but with regular ol ' kitchen cooking oil and dishwashing soap . <p> I did n't buy any new paint for this project , I have so much extra blue and gray latex paint that I mixed up the interior color myself from three different leftover paints , but after it dried I color matched it the closest is Boca Raton Blue ' by Benjamin Moore . <p> Inside the blue interior is a new pale gray monitor ( practically impossible to find white for a PC , do n't get me started ) a lamp , and other colorful office supplies. - Do n't worry about the heat from the lamp housed inside , it 's a 25 watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp soon . <p> It 's so kid friendly now which is great since the kids have homework and testing to complete on the computer . <p> The workstation and printer hide down below , so convenient that they actually fit ! <p> - . <p> I made a fabric covered corkboard with the left side door for pinning calendars or other miscellaneous papers . <p> To make it , 1. - I used a package of cork tiles purchase at an office supply store and trimmed them to fit with a box cutter. - 2. - A basic stapler will affix the fabric to the cork. - 3. - Use a strong glue designed for adhering multiple surfaces to secure the cork to the wood. - 4. - Paint cans weighed down the fabric covered cork to the door overnight for maximum adhesion . <p> . <p> I also made a cute fabric covered mousepad with some scrap fabric , for the step-by-step follow this tutorial from a few years ago . <p> A white keyboard helps keeps it light and bright ! <p> . <p> On the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make your own chalkboard paint which is what I did with some leftover paint from these bookshelves ( closest color match is Fiji ' by Benjamin Moore ) and non-sanded grout . <p> . <p> I kept the outside the dark stain because it sits on the edge of our family room and blends in better this way . <p> The kitchen and family room are just to the right so I can keep an eye on kids and their homework when it 's open . <p> All it needs now is my big binder I put together every school year with all the schedules , handouts , and miscellaneous papers. - School starts Wednesday , so I 'm ready ! <p> Fingers crossed I can keep it this organized when school is back in session . <h> 79 comments <p> I totally need one of these for when the day comes that small children move into my office ( which is inevitable and makes me so sad and so happy at the same time ) . Something like this is perfect for a main room in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> SOOO beautiful ! My only concern is the magnetic bar so close to the monitor- will that cause any issues ? Cause magnets + electronics= bad news bears . I cant get the depth perception to see how close it actually it <p> What a wonderful idea I am so impressed , I too would love to start out the school year organized , It is difficult because we are remodeling a old house we bought last Oct . Thanks for the inspiration- I hope that my blog will bring such inspiring ideas to my blog friends I think I will have to add your button to my blog- ! THANKS Have a wonderful day dawn is dreaming . <p> Gorgeous ! ! ! I love how it turned out . Kate you never stop amazing me .

I desperately need to do something to the interior to make it functional and pleasing . Had n't  thought of just painting the interior . <p> What a great idea to just brighten the interior and leave the exterior darker color that works for you intact . It makes such a great difference to brighten this work space . I also appreciate the paint remover tip . Mineral spirits has such a drying effect on the skin , I had resorted to using a pumice to scrub the primer I got on my hands with my last project also hard on the skin . This would be SO MUCH better ! ! Will try it the next time . Thanks <p> we have a similar cabinet but its a corner one , and we incorporated it into a new bathroom as a built-in linen closet ! we nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it since it has been with us so long and now is a unique architectural feature . <p> The amazing Kate strikes again ! Yey ! Love , love , love it ! Thanks for the tip gain about the primer , need to paint my laundry cabinets and I was just thinking about what primer to put ! i am sure this bright and beautiful spot would be a great place for the kids to do their research under your careful eye ! Great job as always ! ; - ) <p> This post is awesome ! I am pretty sure everyone I know has a computer armoire , and really is n't sure how to dress it up . Including me . Ive pinned a few things in Pinterest in the past , but this is my favorite so far . Thanks for sharing . PS You just got pinned : ) <p> Cool . I always knew I did n't  want to use the similar computer armoire we own , and now I know why and how to remedy it . Ill copy every one of your ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mouse pad ! <p> I hate trying to get sticky oil paint off my skin , so I usually paint wearing cotton stretch , neoprene-palmed gloves . And as a professional painter , I keep a bottle of cheap , cocoa butter hand lotion in the work van . Using that with a clean rag gets hands cleaner than washing with soap and water . <p> Thanks for another great tutorial . I know you 'll have an organized , happy school year with such an auspicious beginning . <p> I love the blue interior ! I have a similar armoire that used to house a tv.I turned into a computer armoire a couple years ago , with covered cork boards on the inside doors too , and my kids use this computer for all their school work . Its worked great for us since we can close the doors and hide the mess when not in use ! <p> ooo I love it ! I love every re-purpose project you do ! I also want to see what you do with the school binder ! I wont have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get ideas for how to keep our lives best organized when it does happen ! Do you have a post on it already ? If not , will you do one ? <p> Love it love it love it ! I have been trying to get up the guts to paint my old computer desk too . Would that primer cover up the heavy wood grain on oak furniture ? Thanks for the tip about the veggie oil ! <p> School started here yesterday and as I sit reading this I am facing our computer armoire . I had been thinking of getting rid of it , going to a desk , but after your ideas , I think I 'll keep it . I had n't  thought of just painting the inside . Ours also is like a tomb inside and someone is always complaining about the iight from outside not reaching in ( and that ity bity light built in does n't  help ! ) Thanks for the ideas , always great . <p> That is so awesome ! Love it ! I am always confused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use oil based primer on furniture ? Also I have to paint over wall paper in my kitchen . We tried everything to get it off . IMPOSSIBLE ! Should I use an oil based primer over the paper ? Any tips would be greatly appreciated ! <p> Kate , that is gorgeous ! I always get confused about what kind of primer to use . Do you always use an oil based primer on furniture ? Also I will be painting over wall paper in my kitchen YUK ! We have tried everything to get it off . Nothing has worked . Should I use an oil based primer over the wallpaper ? Any tips would be greatly appreciated . Thanks Kate ! ! <p> Hi Sonya , I try to avoid using my nice brushes with oil based primer I usually stick to toss away rollers these days ! With brushes , you still need to use paint thinner or mineral spirits to remove all the paint from the fibers . Kate <p> A happy and cheery place for homework , a great idea . I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about it being a dark , dreary place to sit and work we 've repurposed ours as a " technology garage " to hold ( out of sight ) all the wireless printers and supplies , scanners , phones , chargers , modems , the list goes on , that otherwise would clutter many different spaces . Great idea for chalk board / pin board on inside of doors and that might be added to our " garage " . THRILLED with your tip of olive oil + grease removing dish soap to get primer ( that 's my fav one too ) off the hands . Thanks : ) <p> Wow . Wishing the only armoire I own was not in my room . Really great idea . I am on board with getting as organized as possible this year as well . It seems as though once school starts , there is no slowing down to do so ! I better get on it . <p> Oh my goodness Kate , I just HAVE to do this to our computer armoire .. its almost identical to your before photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , and its so stinking DARK I cant see a thing . This is brilliant and gets me so in the mood to get organized ! You inspired me to do the junk drawer last week thanks for getting my butt in gear ! ; ) <p> I am pretty sure this is one of my favorite posts of yours yet . The whole thing turned out wonderful , I adore that pop of fresh color inside , but yet the integrity of the original piece remains on the outside . So great ! And all of your lovely accessories and colors are incredible , fab organizing to boot ; ) I am always so inspired after hanging out here for a couple of minutes ! <p> This is so cute ! For the longest time it never occurred to me to paint furniture . It always just seemed like , it came like this .. there is no changing it . Reading your blog along with others has really taught me how to re-purpose things and give older things much needed facelifts . I even feel compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Can I ask you how the paint has held up on the shelf with the keyboard ? Ive painted a lot of furniture and I want to paint a computer armoire at our cottage . Was just worried about how that would hold up . also the area that the monitor sits on ? What type of paint did you use for your main paint ? Thank you . 23102 @qwx883102

Just this morning I had a meeting with my contact from the Committee on the Shelterless ( COTS ) , a local non-profit I work with each year ( see all previous space transformations for COTS here ) . <p> I learned there are two more homes they use for transitional housing that are in need of remodeling , and I 'll be working on them this fall . I 'm very excited about these homes , they include two more kitchen remodels and at least two more bathrooms to renovate . I 'll be sure to document the space transformations here on the blog as I always do ! <p> The Las Vegas flip house is under way , the popcorn ceilings are gone , the walls are retextured . You know how I feel about smooth texture it makes the home look and feel brand new and is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be painted , then the new flooring goes in . We will be adding a luxury vinyl plank floor throughout the single story home , I 'll be sharing that as it happens . <p> My first space remodel in the Las Vegas house that I 'll tackle will be the laundry room , it was framed in as part of the garage and it 's not looking good in its current state but I 'm going to make it shine , here 's a look at it now , very basic and blah . <p> The first thing to- do is cover- the cement floor. - I 'll choose tile or waterproof vinyl plank which seem the most practical . Also the old washer and dryer should be replaced by front loaders to modernize the space and also to- make room for a folding counter . <p> I love the use of colorful painted cabinetry in a laundry room . Let 's face it , it 's a space dedicated to a chore , the pretty hue on the cabinets in this laundry room by Ashley Winn Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile floor ! <p> - <p> This is a wonderful laundry room makeover from Chris Loves Julia , - it includes a wood folding countertop and upper cabinetry for storage of laundry related products . I 'm inspired by the idea of adding a small sink too . <p> - <p> Keeping with the idea of colorful cabinetry , the soothing green cabinets in this laundry room are a lovely color , the larger sink splits up the folding counter which is pretty but I 'd prefer a smaller sink off to the side . <p> - <p> This blue and white laundry room has always been a favorite space , I love the use of a simple striped fabric to hide the storage below and the stainless steel countertop . <p> - <p> The warm grey cabinets in this laundry space are so sophisticated , the beadboard wainscot makes the space feel timeless and elegant . <p> - <p> I 'm excited to share the transformation of this laundry room- space and the additional- COTS spaces with you this year ! Tell me your favorite things about your laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry room remodel ? I 'd love to read them ! <h> 34 comments <p> Thanks for sharing these ideas . I always wanted a counter over my washing machines but my sink is in the middle . I 'm glad you included one idea that shows how it could be done when sink is not off to the side . <p> Love all your ideas . I recently redid a laundry room for a client in the Bay area in a 1980s tract home . The addition of horizontal stripes on the wall and framed photographs of laundry hanging from spots the client had visited on their travels turned this chore oriented room into a visual delight . And I like the personal touch it added . <p> If I ever get a laundry room I will absolutely be putting in a washboard sink . Its a stainless steel sink , with a washboard on the front ! So clever . And I agree about the colorful cabinets its definitely a space you can take some risks &amp; have fun . Plus since its typically a simple layout you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so even more reasoning to paint them a color . <p> replacing washer/dryer you are talking about dropping $1500 ! if they work , just keep the old onesours is also in the garage , with a wall separating it from the rest of the garage.its a 10+10 area.we also have a small chest freezer in there and a repurposed bathroom wall cabinet , painted a medium gray.we will be adding a base cabinet that will butt up to the freezer , at a 90 degree angle.below the cabinet , painted to match , with a black top to hold items as I put them in or out of the freezer. , above the wall cabinet we will build a 2 ft wide soffit and paint that entire wall in 4 inch light gray and white stripes.the other 3 walls will be a dove gray with with trim.the concrete floor will be a dark gray , and I may find a colorful rug for in there.where we now have a freestanding pantry , in the corner opposite , we will be building shelves , instead.and painting them white . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mudroom . We have our sink off to the side which allows for one long continuous counter between the sink and washer/dryer . I love it . I have three upper cabinets which provide a lot of storage for items other than laundry supplies , which is nice . I only have one lower cabinet beneath the sink . The rest of the space under the counter is open and where we put the dogs bowls . its nice to have them out of the way . We went with a mid tone grey for the cabinets and It really makes the space look a little more sophisticated ( as sophisticated as a laundry room can be , lol . ) Under cabinet is also one of my favorite features . <p> I also have a little nook with built in shelving that houses the laundry baskets and decorative baskets hiding cleaning items . I also made sure to have a faucet with a sprayer . That has been invaluable . One wall serves as a sort of command center . We have bulletin boards filled with calendars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all in one central location . <p> I do n't  have a real laundry room but in my fantasy one , amongst other things , the washer is raised off the floor with storage beneath &amp; the tumble is stacked above . I do love the marble counters in the pic with the soft sage cabinets : ) <p> Great ideas and beautiful laundry rooms ! We spend a lot of our time in the laundry room and Ive always thought " why not make it as pleasant as possible ? " . Laundry rooms do not have to be only utilitarian . Great job ! <p> Thanks for sharing . I like your inspiration rooms . I am thinking about making a pretty laundry space in my basement . Right now it is just a scary basement that no one really wants to spend time in . Youve give me some good ideas . I cant wait to see the final result ! <p> Thanks for sharing these gorgeous laundry rooms , Kate ! So often laundry rooms are overlooked in a remodel but I see no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . <p> We are still renting so our laundry room is modest looking but personally I prefer symmetric rooms , where the sink divides the counter space into half , like the HB picture you shared . Also , Ive seen laundry rooms in which the washer and dryer get stacked , which may work where space is an issue . Anyway , I 'm looking forward to see your projects come together ! <p> We are getting ready to remodel a house ( closing tomorrow yay ! ) where well be adding an enclosed " breezeway " that will link a sort of a mother-in-law suite that were adding for our daughter to the main house . In this breezeway will be our shared laundry space . I LOVE the examples you shared , they are all gorgeous , but I need tons of space to hang clothes that I partially tumble dry . Can you point me toward some ideas of how to incorporate that into a laundry spaceor maybe that necessary evil is so awful that no one photographs and shares it ! ! : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I built years ago , still one of my favorite LONG ... Have you considered a retractable drying line/cord ? I 've seen those in stores and used them in hotels , they also allow you to dry clothes in that space : ) Kate <p> A folding counter is so practical . Great for folding , of course , but also preventing stray socks , etc from falling in between or behind the machines . For this space , would it be helpful to include space to store , set up and use an iron and ironing board ? I 'm sure that 's not the first priority of the homeless but if these folks are getting ready for job interviews or the like , it might be useful . <p> Hi Sheila , this laundry room is in a house in Las Vegas that I 'm flipping , the COTS shelter houses just require bathroom and kitchen remodels so they 're separate projects , but I do like the idea of space for an ironing board : ) <p> I am wonderingdo you have a front loading washer and is it okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a disaster . When the kids pulled the clothes , they all fell on the floor . It gathered mold in many parts of the door because water pooled there . I have a couple friends that have had similar issues about front loaders and I have never met anyone that really liked theirs . In fact , one friend took hers back to the store after using it once because she disliked it . <p> Lots of great ideas here . My laundry room is large and windowless , but is more of a store-room than anything else . I am babying my 26 year old top loader because only about 10% of the people I know that have front loaders like them . I admit to being a creature of habit . <p> Yep . I went into my local Lowes a while ago to check out counter top material to put on top of my front loaders . The salesman said it would be too heavy no matter what material I used . He would n't help or listen to my mounting ideas . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for showing all of the examples so I can prove to my husband that the salesman was incorrect . Love the look . <p> Yeah , I 'm going to stop following your blog now . I 'm sorry , but the fact that you would post how awesome I think you are but not that concrete and cement are n't  the same thing is really the last straw ( and that is truly a minor criticism given the sheer number of people who conflate the two and it would certainly be a boon to your readers to refer to the correct material as many of your readers write blogs of their own and will proliferate that error . I know that you obviously think this is a minor thing , as you 've disapproved two comments on two separate blog posts to this effec ; , however , you would never refer to a pile of flour as a cake and that is how similar cement is to concrete merely a component ) . <p> Well , that plus the fact that I started following for great DIY ideas and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " donated " cabinets from Kraftmaid until you figure out how to get Kraftmaid to donate cabinets to me , those posts are incredibly unhelpful . <p> I love all the ideas you posted color and organization ! ! ! I love my laundry room . It has a huge built cubby/drawer set for all my kids daily stuff , plus a sink and a large hanging rack for all my air drying . I would love a folding counter but when buying new appliances last year I could n't talk myself into the front loader . Which is fine because it gives me an excuse to fold in the living room where I can watch tv . : ) <p> Eager to read about your experience with luxury vinyl plank flooring ! I was inspired by your choice of wood look tile in your first Vegas house , and I am also looking into VP options for my moms remodel . <p> Excited to see a garage laundry room .

I 've been coveting wainscotting in our dining room and am waiting with baited breath . <p> incredible ! ! ! one of these days when i 'm feeling reeeeeeeally crazy i 'll have to start stripping all of the original woodwork in my house , which currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous owners THINKING ? ! ) <p> Hi Most Centsational One ! I found out about you over at Rhoda 's blog ! Oh , my goodness ! What a beautiful transformation you 've made in your stairway area ! Your railings are gorgeous and the wall ! Oh , you 're too good ! ! Thanks for all the info on how to do this ! I know I will be coming back to see you ! be a sweetie , Shelia : ) <p> Okayno jokeI 've been planning to do the EXACT same thing to my honey oak railing ( and adding white wainscoting on the wall leading up the staircase ) . Thank you sooo much for the great tips . I 'm sure I 'll be doing a post once mine is completed although , I have a few projects to complete before I tackle this one . <p> Hey , Katie ! Hopped over from Rhoda 's blog ! Wow ! ! This is awesome ! We need to call Southern Living magazine and see if they will go out to CA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! Ca n't wait until tomorrow ! ! <p> Kate , I hope you 're enjoying all these lovely comments because they 're so well-deserved . And thank you for being so honest about all the time this took that was a huge investment on your part but it certainly paid off.I have kind of the opposite problem my banisters have been painted ( yes , painted ) a nasty dark brown and I 'm itching to do something about them . Your ' before ' picture really is not so bad ! <p> seriously . amazing . What an beautiful job you did ! You are so brave and very talented ! I love it ! ! ! ! ! Quick question about how you stripped the railing ? What did you use on the tight areas on the curved areas of the railing ? I 've heard a toothbrush works in the crevices , but it did n't work the best for me . Any advice ? <p> hey , sorry if this ? ? was already asked ( i ca n't seem to read thru 119 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' highboy ' in the entry ? that space , w/ window and mirror , looks EXACTLY like mine , altho my entire entryway floor is TINY . it 's always caused problems but i 'm always looking for the perfect pc of furn to go there . wondering what PURPOSE it serves so maybe it would work for us. ? thanks ! bee you tee full work ! kt= ) <p> Great Job , it is very rich looking amazing job the hard work and hours are well worth it . My stairs are prettty much like your old look . My husband &amp; I are going to tackle this project thanks for all your pictures and detailed steps . <p> OK i saw your post the day you posted it , and have been looking for it EVER SINCE ! the second i got out of the site , i couldnt find it again .. and i bet i have thought about it EVERY . DAY . I am SO HAPPY to have found it .. and i showed my husband .. i THINK he is almost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. i will definitely send you a link with my pics once the project is done .. ( since i 'm preggo , i might have to wait til after the baby comes , so i can strip the wood .. ) <p> I absolutely love this transformation . I plan on doing this with my dated oak banister . Couple of questions . Did you use wipe on poly is Satin or Gloss finish ? Also , what kind of finish did the glazing give you , and why did you only use poly wipe on the top of the banister ? Thanks so much . I am super excited to start this project . It will completely transform our foyer just as it did yours . <p> I am about to do the same to my railingthis is exactly what I am trying to achieve ! ! ! I had hardwoods put in on 1st floor and carpet on stairs removed , wood stair treads finished same color as floors but did n't  have them put my railing back in so I could finish it . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bought the Burnt Umber acrylic paint &amp; wipe-on poly minwax ( oil-based ) . However I keep reading online that if applying poly over acrylic , I should use water-based poly because water &amp; oil do n't  mix .. **Have you seen any peeling over time/durability issues ? **If none , did you lightly sand acrylic before applying the one coat oil poly ? <p> I just finished staining our baby cradle with a walnut stain . I hate it . It is blotchy and awful . So I was thinking of doing what you did with your acrylic paint . I was just wondering if you add stain on top of the acrylic paint or if you just put on the wipe-on polythanks ? Could you clarify ? I want to do it right . <p> This is the best diy stair makeover i have seen ! I was truely inspired by this , so much that when I saw it , I decided I would redo mine too right then and there . My staircase is stripped , sanded , and stained ( 2 coats ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Wipe-on poly . How did you apply the acrilyc paint ? Wipe , sponge , brush ? And did you mix it with anything or just applied it straight from the bottle ? And how long did you wait to apply the poly ? I need you 're help , I have my huge project on pause ! <p> WOW . I saw this and immediately started the project of the railings . ( actually I hired someone ) but had them do exactly what you did . WE are almost finished and it is amazing . I am soooo glad you shared your entire process . Looks great . <p> This is very inspiring and I have been looking to do something like this since I moved into my home . I did a google search and found your fab site . This is now my next project to tackle in my home . I did want to know what you used to protect your carpet . As I have nearly the same stairs I 'm concerned when painting the white that might ruin my carpet . Any suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your amazing projects . I found your blog about a month ago and I love it ! I am having new hardwood floors installed on Monday , and I am in the process of sanding and staining the railing and newel post along my stairs . I love how your finished project turned out and I want to obtain the same finish you achieved . I have a question I hope you can answer . Do I apply the Burnt Umber semi-opaque paint first , or the Minwax walnut gel stain first ? I admire how fearless you are , and I hope after this project I gain more confidence , and a little less fear . Thanks again , Kim <p> Hi CG ! This is great , I actually found your webstie after viewing starterhometodreamhome , where she did something similar to her staircase . My staircase design is like yours , but I had to paint the banister AND the spindles68 total . After sanding and applying two coats of walnut gel stain , I applied the acrylic , burnt umber semi-opaque paint , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poly , I applied 2 coats of Rustoleums Painters Touch gloss paint in kona brown , ( like starterhometodreamhome ) and now my banister looks like yours ! Now I 'm painting the spindles and will do the wipe-on poly last . Thanks again , I would have never tried this if it was n't for you ! Sincerely , Chris <p> Hi CG ! First I just want to say I stumbled upon your blog and am now completely hooked . I have been dabbling in refinishing old pieces using paints and stains and it is starting to become quite a passion for me . You have given me some great ideas ! <p> We are suffering from the same blond oak banister that you had . My first fall/winter project is going to be painting the spindles white and staining the handrail . I just wondered if you have any tips for painting the spindles and also for keeping the paint and stain off of the carpet . Eventually I would like to have wood stairs too but its not in the financial cards right now . <p> Any help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inspiring ideas and keep up the great work ! <p> I have been admiring your stair banister for so long and have finally gotten the nerve to do the same ! We also have the ugly honey oak which looks really bad with our new Brazilian koa wood floors ! So I have applied the gel stain walnut color and it is not dark enough so I bought some of the burnt umber acrylic paint . My hope is that you could provide me with some details of how to apply it . How many coats of gel stain should i use before applying the burnt umber ? Any additional advice or help would be appreciated ! Thank You ! ! <p> I want to try what you have done but your pictures are not coming up on this page . Did you take them off ? I love your stairs and want to change ours from the awful honey finish as well ! Our house is 20+ yrs old and we are the 2nd owners with 3 active boys so we need to do something ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tons of inspiration ! I just bought a house that I honestly did n't  want because of all the honey oak throughout its entirety . ( WHY ? ! ) The first thing you notice in our home is the honey-colored stair banister/balcony that takes up so much space . Well , I love our house now , ( minus the never-ending honey cabinetry . ) I also cant see these pics , but will keep checking back because I love the " after " pics of your stairwell and I cant wait to get started ! My husband and friends think I 'm crazy , but now I have proof it can be done . <p> Hi CGA friend told me about your site and I love it . We are getting quotes for our ugly white washed oak banister . I have six kids and not nearly as talented as you , so I will have most of it done by someone else . I might do the banister though after looking at your site . I love the umber glaze . If I wanted to go more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain with the umber ? Thx <p> I 'm going to be doing the same thing on our staircase , only leaving the carpet on the stairs ! This is a HUGE INSPIRATION ! My only question is how were you able to paint the wood molding on the wall side with the carpet intact ! ? Did you have to remove it somewhat , paint , then replace the carpet ? <p> Would you now recommend the same stain you used on the stairs for the railing so you would not have to use the craft paint ? I love the look ! I am inspired now that I see that you can do the stairs and not all the floors at the same time . I thought I was going to have to save up and have it all refinished at the same time . Thanks for the inspiration . <p> Great question Jessica , I would have used the Duraseal on the banister had I known about it ! The glazed banister is holding up well though , those coats of polyurethane sealed it . Duraseal is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers too . Kate <p> Great Looking stairway . General Finishes gel stain ( you 'll have to google to find in your area ) gave me the same look . I did my kitchen cabinets which were oak and no stripping necessary . Used a little liquid sander to dull existing finished . I would like to know how hard it was to lay the wood on staircase and where you got your suppllies for it . <p> This is an opinion question . I , too , have honey oak banisters . I also hav hardwood throughout including the stair treads that are ALL honey oak . Staining the floors is more of a professional job and out of our budget right now . Would it look totally strange to do ONLY the banisters and treads in this espresso finish ? I love it , but not sure how it would look with the rest of the floors still in honey . Advice/opinions , please ! ! <p> Hi Rebecca , I used to think they should match but now after living with it for over a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two wood tones in a space , makes it interesting , push it to three and there 's confusion . Of course there 's always exceptions , but I do n't  think your floors and treads have to match at all go dark on the stairs ! Kate <p> Hi Kate , first of all , you totally inspired me ! I teach at a year round school and made it my mission to redo my stairs this month while I was off . I have dark floors and have had an ugly oak banister for going on 3 years . I did exactly what you did with Minwax Gel stain in Dark Walnut and went over it with Delta Dreamcoat Acrylic in Burnt Umber , but I found that the acrylic dulled the finish , even after one coat of poly over it . I ended up lightly resanding the entire banister , and going over it once again with the Minwax Gel Stain and it brought back the luster , even without the poly . Did you experience the dullness with the glazing process ? How many coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just wondering for future reference : - ) <p> I am trying to achieve the look of your gorgeous stair rails . You are calling the acrylic craft paint " semi-opaque " glaze is that because you added a drop of water to a teaspoon of paint ? I used that same formula , but it is going on as a solid brown acrylic paint . Did you simply brush it on and leave it to dry ? Thanks ! <p> Hi there ! This may sound like a weird request , but the doorway seen at the foot of the stairs is it a single doorway or a double/french ? I ask this because I am looking at adding a door to my formal living room to make it an office that can be closed off , but my doorway is a double with a stair banister in half of the doorway if that makes any sense . I was considering removing the banister and putting a wall up so that it was just a single door entry but I am not sure if it is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Love the transformationI have been telling my husband that we should change the oak to dark stair treads and railingwe have light oak hardwoods at the top of the staircase and the landing in the foyer is a white = greyish marble . his concern is that it wont match the lght hardwoods in the two rooms to either sides of the stairs or the second floor hallway . and your pic shows how great it matches ! great job ! <p> Project update ! We bought our current house in 2009 and the first thing we did immediately after reading your post was strip our honey oak banister and followed your steps to re-stain it . It is still my favorite thing and we get so many compliments ! We also used the technique ( love the craft paint ! that makes all the difference ! ) on our french glass doors to the office . I have a household filled with boys and their millions of friends and the banisters look the same as they did almost 6 years ago ! We are finally hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember those boys ? ? plus big dog &amp; Seattle rain ugh ! ) 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057908 @3257908/ <h> Some Like It Hot <p> By Kate Riley October 3 , 2009 <p> I 've received several emails lately inquiring about painting the brass exterior surround of a fireplace . My response has always been to try a brand of high temperature specialty paint . I 've passed this product several times in the paint aisle at Home Depot and Lowes . Over the summer , I even considered repainting the outside of our old BBQ . But I have never actually gotten around to trying it out until today . This morning , I bought a quart of Rustoleum 's High Heat black paint at Lowes for $13 dollars . This afternoon , I was able to give my two fireplaces a fresher look for very little cost , and without replacing any parts . <p> First , I tackled the living room fireplace . I 've always loved the existing cream marble tile surround and the white mantle , but the brass trim and wood handles ? No thanks . It looked very dated in my opinion . I really wanted it to be less brassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried this specialty paint today , and in about twenty minutes , the fireplace was transformed into something I believe looks much more fresh and modern . <p> So long brass trim . <p> Here 's another glance from afar . <p> Here 's what I did . <p> I prepped the surfaces by cleaning the exterior brass trim around the fireplace and taping off the marble tile . Note that this specialty high temperature paint is oil-based , so clean up requires mineral spirits . For these kinds of smaller projects , I like to use a disposable brush . <p> This paint is also available in a spray paint form for those who prefer the quicker application that comes from spray paint , and can access a well ventilated area . The brush application just happened to work better for my situation . <p> The paint is a more watery than regular latex paint , but goes on pretty smooth . <p> The final product : <p> Next , I gave the master bedroom gas fireplace a fresh coat of black paint . Over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick coat of this specialty paint , and it was good as new ! <p> Before : <p> After : <p> Rustoleum 's High Heat paint is available at Lowes and Home Depot , and comes in several colors , like white , silver , and almond . TheHigh Heat Ultra also comes black , brown , and aged copper . Krylonalso has a line of high temperature paints as well . These paints withstand temperatures up to 1200- F , but they are not designed to be used anywhere that comes in direct contact with flames , so they would not be appropriate for the inside of a fireplace or a BBQ grill . For $13 dollars , this was an inexpensive fix for me , and I 'm pretty pleased with the outcome . <p> Now just for fun , take a look at the real Some Like It Hot ' featuring the hysterical duo of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dolled up as gals , and mixing it up with Marilyn Monroe . Here 's just one great clip among many . <p> And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday October 4th at 8 p.m . PST . Do n't miss out ! <h> 66 comments <p> Wow , they look so much better now . I 've seen the same paint and have been wanting to do mine too , but havent had time yet . I promised myself I would n't tackle any big projects till I complete the desk I am re-finishing . Now that I 've seen yours though , I really want to do mine ! : ) <p> Some Like It Hot is one of my favorites . " Just the way I like em.big n sassy ! " Haha ! <p> Your fireplaces look fantastic with even that small change so much cleaner . <p> I was given a very scratched up barbecue a few years ago and I bought some of that high heat paint and my brother painted it black with orange flames ( he took car painting classes , so that makes sense ) . Its done great ever since ! And its truly one of a kind . ; ) <p> Wow . I did the same project today ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( opened up all the windows even though it was in the 60s outside ! ) . It took me a bit longer because the entire door was brass and I had to tape off each of the four windows . Your fireplace looks great ! <p> I used this paint to paint the inside of my firebox . We have gas logs . When we moved in ( new construction ) the fireplace was a big white blob that always seemed to attract my eye . After twelve years it has held up fine . <p> I love how your whole fireplace just blends in now . It has a very neat look to it . I have the spray paint version and I have brass on the doors of our great room fireplace . Ive been kicking this idea around for awhile now , and since we are hosting the family for our Christmas Eve get-together this year , maybe I should get on that . <p> The brass was distracting and , I agree with you , it has a more updated feel now . Great job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big difference . Hope you have a great Sunday ! pk @ room remix <p> I used the spray paint version on the brass louvres on my master fp back in august . Unfortunately , it still sheds some black residue when touched . It looks great , but I 'm a little concerned with how it will wear . I 'm wondering if you 've had that issue with the brush on paint as well ? ? <p> i 'm not sure that if you know this , but when read in a reader , your post only shows a few sentances . Is there anyway to fix that ? i 'd love to be able to read the whole post because i 'm not able to switch to blog sites at work . <p> What a difference , and for so little cost . It looks so much better . We are gradually taking the brass out of our house . We are slowly replacing all the doorknobs with brushed nickel , the light fixtures and vanity pulls are all changed . I was wondering what to do about the brass plate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes direct sunlight . Great project idea . <p> Great tips ! I wish I had your blog a few years ago when I owned a house . The hardware store in my town was no help so I just left it ( the fireplace ) alone . Now I 'm a renter so I 'll have to use your tips if and when I 'm able to buy another house . : ) <p> Thank you so much for this timely post . My husband and I are in the process of purchasing a house with a fireplace that has the brass on all four sides of the surround . Our " to do " list is about 5 years long but at least I know what to do with the unattractive brass when we get some of the more pressing projects out of the way . Hmmmbut perhaps brass will come back in vogue again by then ! : ) <p> Looks like I will be making a trip to Lowes tomorrowI have the exact fireplace as you and I HATE that brass , but have been nervous to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch the brass as well ! Both your fireplaces look fantastic ! <p> its like you read my mind . i have gold trim around my fireplace as well . and was going to just get paint to cover it , but gladly that you mentioned to use the high heat paint . makes sense ! thanks for this post ! going to go get it tomorrow ! <p> A few years ago the car I was driving started to lose its paint on the top and hood , the car already had a few problems that we knew we would n't be able to sell it for very much , so we tried the high heat spray paint to cover the missing paint . I know this sounds very redneck but when it was done you honestly could n't tell the difference between the panels we painted and the ones we left alone ! <p> This is great . I was wondering the same thing about my old fireplace glass ( changing the brass and wooden handles ) . What did you replace your wooden handles with ? I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for the post . I 'm now inspired to do this today ! <p> Just a thought . . . why are n't  the insides of your fireplaces painted black ? Is that a California thing ? I live in the Chicago area and we all paint the inside of our fireplaces with a specialty black paint ( probably what you are already using ) so that you do not see any soot marks from the fire . It all blends in perfectly , in my opinion , and makes it look really clean . The whole inside of the box is spray painted including the floor . In my first house with a fireplace , I forgot to open the flue and nearly passed out from the fumes while painting ! ! ! ! Learned my lesson and opened up the flue and every window when I touched up my fireplace in my next house ! ! Another thing , have you seen any of those new fireplaces that do not use logs , but rather glass rocks that the flames come out of ? They are so neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has them though , as of yet . I figured that you may be on the bandwagon all too soon . : ) <p> Great posting , its so nice to see someone else has my passion to paint just about everything ! You can get loads of colors of heat resistant paints at the auto parts store . Car enthusiasts use it to paint their engines . You know that 's got to live up to some wear and tear . <p> Someone posted your picture and the link on Pinterest . Painted both of our fireplaces this weekend and they look Amazing ! The price of paint has increased to $15 since your original post . It was worth every dime ! Thanks so much ! <p> Wow . I want to run out to Home Depot right now in my PJs . This is great . I even used this in the spray paint for to re-paint my metal firepit . Never thought about re-doing my fireplace . I have the same type ! ! Looks great ! I cant wait . Doing it ! Thanks !

@@99057909 @3257909/ <h> Sweater Pillows <p> By Kate Riley November 2 , 2011 <p> I love a great challenge ! Last week Katie and friends announced the second Pinterest Challenge ( Fall Edition ) and since I missed it the first time around , I decided to hop on board this time . A few weeks ago I had cozy accents on my mind , specifically sweater pillows . Pottery Barn has made versions of these in the past and there were a few DIYers who came up with their own interpretations too . I loved Megan 's version from Brassy Apple so I pinned it . ( Do n't you love the ability to comment on Pinterest too ? Thanks Julie , you made me laugh ! ) <p> I also loved Megan 's button center and floral accents too ! I went down to my local Goodwill and saw at least a dozen sweaters to choose from . <p> I bought the center one for $3 bucks and brought it home . Then I pinned this : <p> And a few days ago I made this ! <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suits the pillow perfectly . <p> I also found another gray and red striped sweater at the Goodwill for $3 and also stitched up this cozy Christmas accent pillow : <p> Here 's the simple how to : First , cut your sweater to the size of your pillow form ( whether square or oblong ) and allow an extra inch of material all around . Turn the knit material inside out and stitch it together with a sewing machine on 3 -+ sides . Turn right side out and stuff opening with pillow form , then hand stitch the remaining opening closed . <p> Any ol ' sweater you find at a thrift store can become your next decorative accent in these upcoming chilly months ! <p> Wow you make it look easy . . . my sewing machine has n't  seen the light of day in quite awhile but this would be such a cute , stylish and inexpensive way to have a couple of Christmas accent pillows ! <p> Your pillows look so cozy . I made a throw pillow last year from a cashmere sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was able to follow the lines of the cable when cutting and sewing , making it a really easy and quick project . <p> I am hosting a Project Pinterst linky with Katie from Katie Lloyd Photography . When I saw your little blurb on my blogger homepage I got SO EXCITED thinking you were talking about Katie and me ! I see that some other lovely ladies are hosting a similar linky and that in fact you were talking about them ! If you 're interested in linking up with us , come on over tomorrow for the link up ! <p> They both look great , Kate ! No rhyme intended , lol . I have a sweater in my closet that I 've been eyeing since last winter . It flares out too much , so its either going to get taken in on the sides or turned into a pillow . Hmm , tough decision . Thanks for even more inspiration to cut it up ! = ) <p> Catie <p> Oh , check out the post I did today about turning an old throw blanket into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have many pillow cover ideas . But , what I want to know is where people buy their throw pillows . I feel like there has to be a good , cheap place to get them and I 'm just not sure where that is . Please enlighten me . <p> That is a great idea ! I 'm pretty sure I can whip some up using old sweaters that have been packed away for years in a cedar chest ( which will definitely need to be washed first to kill that smell ) . As always , thanks for the inspiration <p> Cut . Sew . Stuff . Stitch . You make it sound so easy . ha ! Actually , I 've been in love with sweater pillows for a long time and never thought to make my own even though I 've made other pillows . Seems like such a " duh " moment now . I 'm going to do this ASAP ! ! Thanks ! <p> Thank you , thank you , thanks you for pointing me in this direction . I 've seen these cushions in the shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had the guts to cut up a sweater . Now ? I 'm off down the charity shops ! xx <p> These look great ! How funny because I just wrote on my forever long project to do list I wanted to make some sweater pillows for the couch . They are just so comfy looking . Thanks for showing how you did it ! <p> I have Goodwill sweaters in waiting too ! I was a little worried how theyd sew , it looks like you did n't  have any problem . Maybe I 'll get off my duff and get these done before winter is over ! Yours look great ! Debbie <p> I just had an epiphany ! I have a beloved sweater that I just ca n't part with though it is looking pretty worn . Its just one of my favoritest favorite things , but really , the elbows are practically see-through and there 's a whole in one armpit . : ) Perhaps instead of getting rid of it completely , I can give it a new life as a pillow ! Thanks for the inspiration ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater conversion done with a button-up style sweater as well , which means you can sew up all sides and get the pillow form in and out by " un-buttoning " the sweater . You can show off the button side or flip it over . Got ta do this project for winter . Thanks ! <p> Love them ! ! This is the perfect thing for a goodwill " hunter " like myself ! : ) One question , do you ever feel that adding a zipper is better if you can so you can take off , or wash it if needed ? Or do you find that not having a zipper works just fine ? Also , have to ever tried buttons vs a zipper ? Just wanted to know your thoughts before I tackle this one ! ! <p> About 15 years ago , when even the last holdouts had gotten rid of their 80s Family Ties sweater vests , I picked up a big pile of them at a thrift store and cut them into squares . Then I zigzag stitched them into a patchwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes a great springtime throw blanket . One side is finished and the other side has the fuzzy , nubby seams . It has held up really well through repeated washing and drying . So , feel free to make throw blankets from rescued sweaters , too ! Give some Cosby sweaters a new home <p> Thanks for this post ! You make it sound so easy , but I have a question.do you do anything to the ends of the yarn after you cut the sweater down ? I wonder about fraying . Any suggestions would be appreciated , thanks ! <p> Great Idea ! ! ! I think that I will make a few of these pillows out of sweaters that my daughter wore when she was young ! Not only will it remind me of the good ole days when she was a little girl , but they will be wonderful to snuggle with too ! Thanks for the inspiration ! Tilara <p> Hilarious ! I just picked up 3 sweaters from the thrift store in town , as well as some thrift store pillows ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those this weekend : D What a crazy coincidence ! I love how yours turned out : D <p> I 've definitely had sweater pillows on my pinterest for a while ! I 'm currently unemployed , so I really shouldnt be spending money on decor ( even thrifty decor ) , but hopefully I 'll have some around next year ! Yours are so cute I love how they really warm up a room . <p> I love the pinterest challenge ! I am getting so many fantastic ideas for winter projects ! This is going to be the perfect match to my boyfriends Christmas present ( a handmade crocheted blanket he s been asking for ) . And this is the perfect project for putting my new ( used ) sewing machine to the test ! <p> Kate ! KATE ! KATE ! KATE ! Thank you soooo much for reminding me about sweater pillows . I pinned some months ago and thought I *have* to make some of these for Christmas presents . I 'd forgotten all about them ! You 're like my little Christmas Fairy . Keep it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I know that this is probably cheating , BUT I got a JC Penney flyer in the newspaper and guess what was on the front cover ? Cable knit sweaters in every conceivable color you could imagine , each well under twenty bucks and that was before all of their coupons . You could conceivably get one for around ten bucks , in the color you want and brand spanking new . I think they are in the juniors or misses department . I saw those sweaters and it never even occurred to be to wear them . The first thing I thought was pillows ! ! ! ! <p> These pillows are beautiful ! You can also use the sleeves for another project . Just cut off a sleeve , fill with uncooked white rice , and tie both ends with dental floss . Put in the microwave for a few minutes and you 'll have a warm , moist heat to relieve painful muscles or warm your cold feet . It can be reheated many times . A friend gave me one years ago , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck is hurting . <p> Those are beautiful , great job !

@@99057910 @3257910/ <h> Adventures in Candy Making , Part One <p> By Kate Riley February 5 , 2010 <p> I 've got a few savory recipes up my sleeve , and now and then I like to share them . However , one thing I have never done ( until this week ) is made candy . I 've made brownies and fudge . I 've even made a ganash . But never ever in my life had I ever dipped my toe into the pool that is candy making , whether it be truffles or caramels . <p> Several months ago , I stumbled across this recipe for salted caramels at Smitten Kitchen , and ever since I 've had caramels with sea salt on the brain . Some of you may be thinking , how do sweet caramel and salt even go together ? But I assure you , there 's something about the competing flavors of sweetness and saltiness , and when blended together , it forms the perfect medley . <p> Making caramels requires a tool that I previously did not possess : a candy thermometer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd try my hand at actually making some caramels and chocolate candies for friends . So I bought a candy thermometer for $15 dollars at Michaels and thus began this little adventure into making caramels and other chocolate candies . <p> Oh yes , I know what you 're thinking . What a darling little carton of candy ! Do not be fooled . Yes , it 's true , all 's well that ends well , but I must confess it was a somewhat rough journey to get to this blissful box . <p> Originally , when I glanced at the simple ingredients for caramel candy , I was emboldened . Butter , sugar , cream and corn syrup . What could go wrong ? <p> Little did I know that complexities and complications lurked around the bend . <p> And as I write I 'm just now realizing that the sugar in the bowl has a rather , shall we say , feminine shape to it . Note to self : double check staging when photographing ingredients . <p> I printed out the Smitten Kitchen recipe , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned on coating my morsels in dark chocolate instead . Then I decided to get really clever by doubling the recipe so I could make that much more gooey goodness . I measured out my cream and sugar , and carefully sliced by butter into perfect tablespoon size pats . Then I added it all to my very tall pot . <p> Oh I thought I was so cool . How hard can this really be ? <p> Then a strange thing happened . Unbeknownst to me , there is this intense bubbling up that occurs when the cream mixes with the dissolved sugar . Just after I inserted my new candy thermometer , the mixture started to rise . . . <p> . . . and rise . . . <p> . . . till it boiled up to the top . PANIC ! <p> I started blowing on the bubbles hoping it would help , then frantically turned the heat off . Breaking out in a sweat , I was convinced I was doing something drastically wrong . I started pacing back and forth , what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I read do they ever explain that this chemical reaction would occur . <p> Like Charlie Brown , I convinced myself that I was a total failure . <p> This looks more like the surface of Mars than candy . <p> But then something magical happened . On medium heat , the mixture started to get kind of , sort of , well , like caramel . As the caramel bubbled , the temperature on the thermometer began to rise . <p> There is no truth to the idiom that a watched pot never boils . Oh yes it does . Especially when it 's becoming the wonder that is caramel candy . As the caramel boils , you must sit and wait . And you wait and watch and wait and watch . Until it hits that magical temperature of 246- . <p> This is so much like high school chemistry class , only without the pimple faced chem partner . And tastier in the end . <p> Did you know there 's a huge controversy over the exact temperature to cook caramel ? Oh yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously dipped my toe into this candy makers world . I found it quite amusing to sit back and read the arguments about why 252- is far superior to 242- . But I was convinced somewhere in some commentary that 246- is the perfect temperature , and I remain convinced . <p> 246- is perfect because your caramel will be not so hard that you chip a tooth and not so soft that it 's a gooey mess . It will be just the perfect amount of chewiness to stick to the back molars while you continue to salivate , and then have to excuse yourself to go find a toothpick . <p> So then my mixture arrived at the perfect temperature : 246 degrees ! <p> I was so excited about this chemical accomplishment that I quickly moved to the next step : pouring the caramel into the parchment lined pan . <p> I was so proud of its color . Its shine . Its caramely goodness . <p> As I admired myself in the reflection I realized I 'd made a critical mistake . <p> OMG . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BUTTER ! ! ! <p> What is caramel without butter ? What is life without butter ? There is no life if there is no butter . It 's a universal truth . <p> Then I took a deep breath and calmed down . I tasted the remnants in the pot and came to this conclusion . No one will even guess with all that cream that you forgot the butter . Especially when you add the salt and coat with dark chocolate . So let 's just keep that little forgot the butter ' tidbit to ourselves , shall we ? <p> After about ten minutes , when your caramel starts to harden , sprinkle your caramel with sea salt . <p> Consider doing this right away . <p> Allow your caramels to cool about two hours , then cut them into bite size pieces . <p> In good company these are two to three nibble ' pieces , but at home in your pajamas , these are one big bite ' pieces . About an inch or so works pretty well . <p> Then you melt your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsweetened Baker 's chocolate and semi sweet chips . <p> Combine in a microwave safe bowl . <p> Inhale deeply . <p> Build strange little robot like buildings . <p> Then melt in the microwave . On high for the first minute , then stir every 30 seconds for a total of 2 to 3 minutes . Remove when almost melted and stir baby stir . Do not overcook . <p> Does anyone else feel like Augustus Gloop right now , or is it just me ? <p> Add cream to a tall pot and bring to just a boil , reduce heat to medium low then add sugar and corn syrup . Watch for the bubbling up , it will happen . Reduce temperature , then add candy thermometer to pot , and boil on medium low approximately 20 minutes ( or maybe more ) stirring gently and occasionally . At around 240 degrees add butter and gently stir to blend into caramel . When candy reaches 246 degrees , pour into parchment lined pan . Do not scrape sides or bottom of pot after you pour as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caramel . Let stand 10 minutes , then lightly sprinkle with sea salt . Cool completely , about two hours . <p> Melt chocolate in microwave safe bowl on high in microwave for 1 minute . Continue melting every 30 seconds until most of chocolate is melted about 2 to 3 minutes , then remove from microwave and stir until all chocolate is melted . Do not overcook . <p> Cut caramels into 1 or 1.5 inch squares , then dip into melted chocolate , and allow to cool on parchment paper . Caramels keep up to two weeks in airtight container at room temperature . <p> How funny ! They look delicious though . I have done that left out the ABSOLUTE main ingredient ! But usually it turns out alright . One time I made pralines , only to have it turn into praline ice cream crumbles that I put in pretty jars with a nice ribbon ! ; - ) I may just have to try these ! <p> i have a deep love for salted caramel . I made some for cupcakes back in October and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 350 degrees and I trusted it because it was Martha but of course it burned into a black mess . I walked away from the second batch at a critical moment and that burned too , but my third batch came out perfect ! Making caramel is hard ! Your candies look sooo delish . <p> Kate , I once forgot butter ( for Toffee ) and thought I 'd have to throw the pot away . I love making candy , but usually only do it at Christmas . Need to get some going for Vday . Hey , are n't  you on the coast ? Humidity can do funny things to candy , I found this rainy season . Glad yours turned out beautifully ! <p> LOL ! That is a great narrative of a task that I 've always been scared of too ! Candy making has always been my nemesis . I know NOTHING about candy makingand i 'm a pretty good cook ! In factembarassing as it is to admitlast year I tried to make Fudge that called for confectioners sugar and I used granulated sugar instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had mixed a bucket of sand in with the chocolate . It was nasty ! I will be purchasing a candy thermometer too and trying those caramels outyou did a great job and I hope I do n't  forget the butter tooalthough that would be just like me ! : ) <p> I get the way you did about the boiling quite often when I 'm making something new . I always mess up the recipe somehow add the wrong ingredient , add the wrong amount of the right ingredient , forget it all together . ahh , the joys of learning to cook ! <p> You are so funny . That looks like a delish recipe ! I wonder if the texture would be different with the butteryoull have to try it some other time and tell us the differencebecause no butter cuts the fat quite a bit . Interesting ! Great storytelling , too ! : ) <p> What a sweet girl , patiently waiting for the candy to cool and be ready to eat . I 'm not sure I could have done as well . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilting , something I 've wanted to do but havent had the courage to try . <p> So can you write your modified recipe ? I was looking at Smitten Kittens but I 'm confused about whether you need to boil the cream if you are n't  adding chocolate ? And did you just throw the cream , sugar and corn syrup all in the pot at the same time ? Or did you boil the sugar , corn syrup and water first and then add the cream ? Sorry for all the questions . . . but I 'd love to try these . I 've made toffee tons of times , but it is kind of a different process ( at least the way I make it ) . Your candy looks absolutely delicious . . . I 'm drooling over here . <p> I 'd be happy to send you my address , I 'd love one of those little cute boxes . I actually love sea salt and caramel or chocolate . Im surprised that you salted the caramel before the chocolate dip . The ones I 've had all have the sea salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful recipe from a cooking class for flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel . I have n't tried to make it myself , I know I 'll eat it all . These look amazing ! <p> Oh Kate they turned out WONDERFUL ! I can only imagine how they taste G .. like I tweeted to youI think you need to send me a box of those ! LOL .. my hubbys FAVORITE is caramels , he would think he died and went to heaven ! ! .. your much braver than I am. and Raspberry Chocolate Squaresthose would be for ME ! + <p> You should know that as I was reading this , I came to your statement about the form of the sugar and immediately stopped reading to scroll down for the picture ! Lol ! ! Hilarious ! ! These look amazing , well done ! I will be blaming you when I use this weeks Michaels coupon for a candy thermometer . <p> Classic post ! Had me laughing from the beginning , but the comment about the sugar sent me over the top ! Forgetting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned out deliciously in spite of it all . The look incredible and your packaging couldnt be cuter ! Thanks for sharing ! Looking forward to the next installment ! = ) <p> Wonderful ! ! Loblaws here in Canada had Caramels in dark chocolate with sea salt sprinkled on top , at Christmas , luckily I bought a box when they were on sale just after . WOW ! What a super taste combination and one I would never have come up with on my own . VERY ADDICTIVE ! Congrats on making your own . <p> Hi , sweet friend ! Hope you are making your way back home to CA ! I 'm just amazed that you make your own candy too . Is there anything you DO NT do , girlfriend ? Thank you SO much for sharing your candy with me , it is just delish . My hubby and I enjoyed some when I got home last night at 9:30 &amp; oh my gosh , YUM . Had a great time meeting you and hanging out together &amp; so glad you came to Blissdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made caramel ! People were SO impressed and my pants are a little tighter all thanks to you ! You were right about 246 also . I overcooked the first batch at 250 but 246 made the most unbelievable caramel I have ever tasted . I followed your lead and dipped them in chocolate . I am so excited to have this new skill . Thank you ! ! ! <p> These look amazing , esp . for a first time . I dipped caramels in chocolate for Christmas , and then topped with a bit of sea salt at the end . I felt it had two purposes to hide how ugly my dipping job was and to add some salt to the sweet caramels . They were a huge success . One thing I learned while dipping my chocolates and searching the web was to place the caramels on the wax paper and then slowly move them just a bit using a fork to help reduce the " foot print " of the chocolate . <p> Hi , I just tried your recipe today and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ! I was giddy they were so good ! I am packaging some up to give to friends for Valentines day . Thank you so much for the delicious inspiration ! Looking forward to your next installments ! <p> This is a great recipeand I had the same experience the first time I made caramels , so I had to laugh . In fact , each time I make them , they come out slightly differently , but they 're one of my most popular items . I dip them in Callebaut or Valrhona dark chocolate , and they are seriously scrumptious . <p> I have a burning question for any candy makers out there : I make a toffee recipe that uses 1 pound of butter and 2 cups of sugar . You boil them while stirring to 240 Deg , then add chopped almonds and cook till 300 deg . What happens is that the butter starts to separate out of the recipe and when you pour the candy onto the cookie sheet a lot of the butter just runs off . It affects the final texture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If so do you have a cure ? Thanks , Barb <p> OK , I tried this for the first time tonight . I had to half recipe because I only had a pot that was about 1/2 the height of yours . I was afraid it would boil over . It seemed to be doing OK .. that is until it started smelling like it was burning.is that normal ? Why is this project so frightening ? LOL its almost like panic attack mode sets in . The bottom of my pan was burned sugar , but I did not scrape . I was left with this very pretty marbled effect . I did cheat and taste it before it had cooled 2 hours . The flavor is yummy . I plan to see if it sets up . If not , then I will attempt to dip in chocolate and see what happens . <p> I know exactly what your talking about when the candy starts to rise in the pot . I have made peanut brittle for years and I still panic when adding the soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stir faster , faster , faster . <p> For all the blogs that I follow , I 'm not one to typically leave a comment . Yet after reading your hilarious commentary I felt that I HAD to , as it was completely relatable ! I too have been in almost that exact same situation ( albeit with caramel syrup ) , of pacing back and forth , breaking into a sweat , squinting at the thermometer , turning the stove off in a panic , and yes , occasionally forgetting a key ingredient . I had to giggle outloud and its nice to know I 'm not as crazy as my partner seems to think I am ! <p> I tried making these caramels today . I used a 3 qt saucepan and it kept bubbling up to the rim and would not get above 225 degrees . I finally ( after about an hour of boiling ) dumped it into a 5 quart pan and was able to let it boil without it getting up to the rim . It still took quite a while to get up to 240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 9+13 pan and look like they will turn out ok , but it was a LONG process trying to get them up to temperature <p> I have tried this recipe twice and both times I struggle to get the temperature above 200 degrees . The bubbling happens but the temperature does not seem to rise . Both times it has taken over an hour of boiling on medium . What am I doing wrong ? ? <p> Oh no how frustrating Alyssa ! I wonder if you 're using the same equipment ? I have repeated the recipe and it has worked for me , you do need to wait some time , I 'm so sorry your version is n't working ! Kate <p> Okay , so my sisters both made this and it was so good . They are awesome bakers . I , on the other hand , am more of a tester than a baker . I loved theirs so much that I had to try . It took a lot of patience , something I am short on . I wanted to pull it off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 246 but it finally did and . I DID IT ! ! ! They turned out perfectly . I even brought some to work and everyone loved them ! ! Thank you for spreading the love . 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057917 @3257917/ <h> Sea Salt Caramel Fudge &amp; Hot Chocolate on a Stick <p> By Kate Riley December 14 , 2015 <p> This time of year like so many I indulge in baking sweet treats . This year my favorite- culinary delight is sea salt caramel fudge . I love the divine medley of dense rich chocolate paired with sweet caramel and a dash of salt . I whipped up a batch over the weekend to give as gifts to teachers and girlfriends and wow is it delicious ! <p> I also turned the squares into cellophane wrapped hot chocolate on a stick to give as holiday gifts . Ingredients and printable label below ! <p> To make the fudge , combine two 14 oz. cans of the sweetened condensed milk with 1 cup of half &amp; half in a large pot and stir them together over low heat . Slowly add in the chocolate chips and unsweetened baking chocolate ( break the baking chocolate bars- into small pieces first ) . Stir constantly over medium low heat until chocolate is completely melted ( 5 to 8 minutes ) and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with parchment paper ( sprayed lightly with nonstick cooking spray ) . I 've also cooked the fudge in two batches by cutting the recipe in half and cooking two batches in a row , that also works. - Allow fudge to completely cool for 5 to 6 hours . <p> To make the caramel top yes you will need a candy thermometer . A lot of people read that and think " oh nevermind " and will never make this . Great caramel is all about temperature and unless you 're an expert and can tell the exact moment when its ready , a candy thermometer is an essential tool for the perfect caramel top . DO NT BE AFRAID ! Once you make caramel , you 'll be hooked and you 'll use that thermometer again and again . You can find a candy thermometer in larger grocery stores or in kitchen supply stores . <p> Caramel &amp; Sea Salt Top Ingredients <p> 1 -+ sticks salted butter ( 9 tablespoons ) <p> 1 -+ cups sugar <p> 3 tbsp light corn syrup <p> 1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caramel top , melt the butter on low heat then add the sugar , combining the- melted butter and sugar- so they 're blended together . Next add the corn syrup and 1 can of 14 oz. sweetened condensed milk . Bring the entire mixture to a boil . Reduce heat to low and stir constantly until mixture turns a golden brown . This takes anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes depending on your altitude , you 'll be looking for it to turn the color of peanut butter . My town is close to the California coast and only 30 ' above sea level so it takes my caramel about 10 minutes to cook to the proper temperature after the boiling point . <p> Be sure to insert the candy thermometer after a few minutes of stirring and when it reaches 246 degrees turn off the heat and pull the pot from the burner . Spoon a thin amount of the caramel over the fudge base and quickly smooth it out before the surface of the chocolate base melts . After you spread the caramel , sprinkle it with sea salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key and cooking time is affected by altitude . 246 is the temperature I 've used for years for making basic candy caramels . If you have never made caramel before its a good idea to experiment with a batch of caramel candy first to get the hang of it . ( Use the recipe above and pour into a baking sheet covered with parchment paper to test the right amount of cooking time at your altitude ) . <p> My good friend who lives down the road from me swears by 245 degrees and her caramels are always soft , chewy , and delicious . For this project I believe between 246 and 247 is ideal , if you want that caramel topping just a hiiiiint harder than chewy candy caramels choose 247 . I cooked my caramel to 247 degrees on this most recent batch and the caramel was soft but also crumbly in places , still delicious but also easier to cut . If you want your caramel slightly softer , stop cooking it at 246 degrees . <p> These fudge squares are so delicious and wonderful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be amazing served alongside vanilla bean ice cream as a decadent dessert . <p> Kick it up a notch by turning the fudge into hot chocolate on a stick ! I 've seen basic hot chocolate on a stick sold in a few stores this season ( Target and Anthropologie ) the homemade version makes very sweet gifts or a- rich treat for yourself and the sea salt caramel topping adds a sophisticated flavor . I used candy sticks and cake pop cellophane packages from Michaels to package them . <p> Melted squares of sea salt caramel fudge turned into hot chocolate , YUM ! You simply heat up 8 oz. of lowfat milk until its steaming hot then dip the fudge on a stick into the milk and let it melt for 2 minutes , wow the result is very rich and delicious flavor , perfect after a long day of playing in the snow <p> I guess I will be the saddest person on this Christmas . I am on a diet and I have stomach problems so I can cook this for my relatives . Omg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the most important is that looks not that hard for making .

@@99057924 @3257924/ <h> Using Pattern to Dictate Palette <p> By Kate Riley April 9 , 2013 <p> I 've had my head wrapped up in ideas for my fabrics for the past few days and then realized some of you asked about pattern mixing in the comments on my youngest daughter 's room ( see it here ) . One question was how to go about mixing patterns successfully and Michelle offered up a few really great tips last week . <p> My approach to effectively use multiple patterns in a room is to start with one pattern that will dictate the palette and go from there . I pick a patterned fabric I love ( or sometimes rugs or wallpaper or artwork ) and use that as a jumping off point for the additional colors and patterns that will be included in the space . Here are some examples of the technique in some beautiful designer spaces and then a quick example of my own . <p> This wallpaper in this sitting room sets a lavender and green palette with the lampshades playing off the green and the purple zebra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two colors next to each other on the color wheel will work together , below is a beautiful medley of bold green and blue in a floral paired with geometric print wallpaper and accent pillows , that print taking its color cue from the botanical . Mixing florals with geometrics is a win win combination ! <p> Choosing one large scale dominant print such as the lavender and green botanical on the sofa below creates a jumping off point for other choices in the room . Notice a softer lilac print in the window panels and bedding and yet another lavender small scale motif next to a green solid on the sofa . <p> A bright paisley in pink and orange sets the palette in this vibrant bedroom , with a smaller scale zebra-ish print appearing on the lampshade and another bold version of a hue in the headboard present on the nightstand . <p> Your palette does n't need to be bold if your fabric is not . Use the same technique when decorating with softer tones or traditional fabrics . The pale pastels that appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller scale fabrics on the bed and tufted bench . <p> Here 's a basic example I created of how to use a pattern found in fabric to dictate an entire room 's palette and pattern choices . 1 . Start with the beautiful watercolor floral as your jumping off point . Notice that gray is a neutral that is present so it can be repeated in the form of 2. grasscloth wallpaper or 3. a greek key print rug on the floor . 4 . Use the gray yet again in a smaller scale geometric motif ( window panels , pillows , etc. ) . 5 . Pull out the apple green found in the floral and use it as a bright color on an accent chair or bench or settee and again on a smaller scale somewhere else in the room such as a lampshade or ottoman . 6 . Paint one piece of furniture a bold deep blue ( or the walls ) . 7 . Accessorize with any other modern prints that live in that same blue and green palette introduced by the floral . Throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories too . <p> The same concept is true for artwork , Sarah Richardson pulls blues and greens and pinks out of the two pieces of abstract art in these seating areas in her home , working with fabrics in bold stripes , botanicals , and solids . <p> Both fabric and art work together to dictate a bedroom 's fabric and accessory choices below . Notice those Pine Cone Hill pillows have shades of apricot , deep orange , and pale aqua blue . Mixed into this space are two different stripes in blues and oranges on the rug and bolster pillow , and a quilt in a smaller scale coral motif , all in the same palette present in the artwork and decorative pillow fabric . <p> Area rugs are yet another tool for deciding what colors or patterns to include in a space , yellow and gray dominating the motif of the rug in this living room , and the same hues reappearing in the fabrics , artwork , and wall color . <p> So the long answer to those questions is this technique mentioned it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room together . I look to a pattern found in fabric , art , or a great rug to inspire the room 's entire palette and many of the accessory choices in it . Hopefully these examples above help to illustrate ! <h> 21 comments <p> thanks for this Kateyou do such a great job of breaking down the magic of design into simple yet meaningful rules . I must say of all the pictures here , my favorite is the board you created around the blue and grey watercolor fabric . delish ! <p> Q for you : in your mood board example , you used the neutral for walls , floor and windows , do you typically stick with that formula ? Anything that can help this design coordinating illiterate do some decorating on her own is appreciated ! <p> Hi Kate !

@@99057926 @3257926/ <h> A Much Prettier Pool <p> By Kate Riley March 10 , 2015 <p> It feels a little braggy to talk about a pool makeover because not everyone can relate . Bathrooms , kitchens , bedrooms , those kinds of spaces we all have so it feels completely natural to blog about them with all of you . But we happened to purchase a house last year in a desert climate and in Las Vegas , a house with a pool is not only common , but desirable for many . As you know we 've been fixing up the house since July of last year , and the pool was yet another thing to add to the list of major makeovers . <p> When we started our search for a fixer upper we werent looking for one with a pool in the yard , just a house with " space to put one in if we wanted " at the time we did n't  know enough about the major cost of installing a new pool . We were under contract on another house without one , but then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic models start at $40K . And installing an in ground pool ? Yikes , we were looking at prices between $50-70K or more . Pool sticker shock set in and it did n't  pencil out to invest in a home without one . We realized it was smarter to narrow our search to a house with a pool than one without . <p> So we bought this house that has a pool but it was in awful condition . We ended up getting a bigger reduction on the original contract price because of the condition of the pool after the inspection . We knew it would be costly to redo it but the reduction in purchase price justified the added expense of a pool remodel . <p> When we bought the house , this 20+ year old pool and spa had been neglected for many years , so much so it was unsafe to even swim in it . Imagine that burgundy tile all the way around , dingy , cloudy , and chipped in various places . <p> But I 'm happy to share that just this week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plaster and we could n't be more pleased with the gorgeous tile and fresh new look . <p> Choosing pool tile is tricky , there is so much to consider : color , style , price , etc . And its SO permanent its one of those things you want to get right . I was going for a more contemporary look like what 's happening on the interior , and something that was not plain or boring . I loved the idea of a geometric pattern and in teal blue . I was introduced to NPT Pool by our contractor since he could get us a discount and found a pattern in their line that appealed to me , one that looked really nice on the tiered levels of this pools design . The geometric you see is the Moonbeam pattern in " Ocean Green " which is truly a teal blue . <p> I continued the same geometric tile on the raised palm tree planters on either side of the yard , and chose a simpler 3+3 " field tile for the steps and inside the spa to complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is our first house with a pool we 've ever invested in so we were curious about all the remodel steps involved . Obviously hiring a reliable contractor is the first step . <p> Short story : I took pictures of the pool after it was emptied on our last visit , and those pictures showed more detail of the crumbling old plaster , you could pick it off the steps and pool bottom with just your fingers , it was so bad . There was just -+ " of water in the very bottom of the pool and I was leaning over to pick up something when my old phone fell out of my pocket down the steps in the deep end ( shockingly did n't  break ) but then slid in slow motion into the -+ " of water and DIED from water damage . I had not backed up those pictures but trust me when I say the old plaster was like crumbling dried cake , it would fall apart with the tiniest bit of pressure . <p> Over the course of two weeks I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipped out the old plaster down to the gunite and have installed but not grouted the new tile . <p> here 's another with the guys adding the new layers of plaster to the pool after the tile was grouted : <p> Before it was filled up again I walked around inside , the steps reminded me of Santorini , smooth white with flecks of blue . <p> The plaster takes a full month to cure but we got clearance to swim in it in a few weeks when were back for spring break working on the kitchen remodel . Here is Dale our contractor , very proud of his handiwork . Email me if you want his contact info , he also services the pool weekly ( chlorine and cleaning ) . <p> The total cost for the project was $11,500 ( *gasp , I know* ) but far less than a new pool install would cost and necessary if and when we sell the home . It included the labor for the old tile removal and installation of the new ; the labor for chipping out the old plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 110 square feet of 6+6 " geometric , 3+3 " and 1+1 " field tile , grout and thinset ; a new whisper quiet filter , pump , and heater ; and pool deck repair that was crumbling in a few places . The block wall repair between the spa and pool was a separate expense we paid for last year . <p> The rear yard is not huge , the pool eats up most of the backyard but the side yard has a really nice wide area where there is a covering and lawn ( not shown ) , we will add some furniture back here later in the season to create an outdoor seating/entertaining zone . <h> 36 comments <p> I do n't  think its braggy at all ! I love that you can enjoy a pool much more then us northerners can hhehe ! ! ! I also love how simple you kept the design &amp; the color is just enough of paradise without being really busy looking ! The backyard looks great as well with the simple blue table ! LOVE EVERYTHING ! <p> WOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool for 10 years , and repairs are no joke ! But so worth the price considering the alternative ( summer in Texas ! ) . Our new house has the worst , faded tiles around the perimeterso seeing yours makes me excited about the upgrade , but also quest about the sticker shock ! ; ) xo <p> That looks wonderful ! What a great transformation ! I do n't  have a pool or have any interest in owning a pool , but I do n't  think your post is braggy at all . Your choice of tile really made a huge impact . Ca n't wait to see the " entertaining zone " ! <p> Beautiful ! We desperately need to do our pool here in south florida . I love the tile choice ! It is tough trying to pick pool tile so thank you for providing details .. cost , what it covers , exactly which tile , etc . What is the pool deck called ? . is it cool deck , just concrete ? We keep having people tell us to do pavers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a pool owner I enjoyed this . You are so right that adding one is expensive . We put in more than the basic and including the fence and landscaping to shield it from the street , spent close to $100,000 . We know we will never get that back but in a tough market for large homes we hope it will help sell our house . We will be listing it in the summer , of course ! <p> Pools are very common where I live too so I can relate ! We built our own pool a few years ago and it was such a huge undertaking , and very expensive . Your pool is beautiful and I love the turquoise furniture with it . Its such a refreshing change from where I live with the rocks , waterfall and darker colors that fit in with our local landscape . Enjoy your new pool ! Its one of the best decisions we ever made ! <p> That looks so awesome ! We are contemplating a pool in a few years . Do to building code , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if it is covering a pool . Good reason to invest in a pool right ? We live in Florida so it would get used a lot . I 'm going to pin yours to remember in the future . : - ) <p> Beautiful ! I love the tile you selected . This seems like a very worthwhile investment and will make your visits to the Las Vegas home that much more enjoyable . I think some wall planters or some kind of trellis would look great behind the pool : ) <p> I thought that would have been a more expensive renovation ! Maybe because I 'm from San Diego and mostly because I do n't  know pool reno costs , but $11.5k seems like a steal for how beautiful it turned out ! <p> I love the tile that you chose and that teal color is gorgeous ! I currently work at a pool store as a sales associate and I think you 're contractors did an amazing job . You are going to love it this spring and summer ! <p> As a pool owner , I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm contemplating something similar , but without the tile as I have the original slate surround on my 1915 pool ! I want to round the edges and extend the decking . Ill have to research the " cool deck " as I 've never heard of it before . While you consider your tile contemporary , I consider it to have a classic Moorish look . It is just stunning . I think this is my favourite post ever . Thanks you ! <p> This pool is so very beautiful ! Pools are heavenly in the hot states . I used to just sit on the edge and soak my legs and feet , so rejuvenating after work . My in-laws started using salt in their pump instead of clorine . I 'd have to look it up , I know very little about it . Even if you do n't  repair them , they are costly to get rid of . My uncles house came with a pool that he really did n't  want and needed a lot of repairs . It was shocking how many thousands of dollars it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My husband and I have been trying to settle on a tile for our pool re-do for months !

Pleasure Dome . This one consists of adding 3 coats of primer and at least 2 topcoats of a lovely , fresh ivory semi-gloss to my Icky-Orange , Grainy Disco Golden Oak cabinets , enthusiastically installed a week before my wedding that many years ago , by me and the fiancee who had hair back then . <p> I remain Alice-free ( and Hazel-free now I 'm REALLY dating myself ! ) and can not imagine trying to keep open shelving dust-free and orderly . There is a reason they put doors on cabinets . I believe it is to give the plastic food containers and drive-thru cups the privacy they need to multiply prodigiously . A lady should maintain some modicum of mystery and open shelves are simply too exposed . <p> Leave the all-white teapot and French coffee bowl collecting to Martha , close the doors and go out for a peddle on your beach cruiser ( preferably a pink one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to agree with Mandi ! Oh the dust ! I used to keep plates restaurant style on some metro shelving ( the stainless steel kind ) and always had to wash them before using I prefer my new house with lots of cabinets to hide mess ! Plus imagine what the Tupperware would look like ! Yikes ! <p> I feel like a mix of the two would be the most practical because you could store your pretty serving pieces that get used once or twice a year out on display all year long ( And then make seasonal displays during the times you do need to use the plates ) . Or use them for a collection on old plate or pitchers or things like that . They would drive me crazy though . I hate dusting and I like to hide my clutter . It would definitely force you to be organized though ! <p> I love the openness of open shelves , but I also hate to dust ! If I ever have open shelving in my kitchen , it would be only for items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , thus no dusting required ! <p> I love the look and might do it after my kids are grown and gone and I can buy a matching set of dishes that I can reasonably expect wont be broken . My plastic Disney character cups will be gone Oh , wait . I am almost 48 and my youngest is 65 ! I will effectively be parenting my entire alloted life span . I will learn to be content with clutter. : o ( <p> I truly love open shelving . But I wonder about things like dust , or pet hair . I have one open shelf above my sink where I display pretty things like cake stands , platters , vases and such , but otherwise it seems very impractical . Especially for people with kids who likely have a lot of tacky plastic cups and bowls ( like me ! ) <p> I 'm in agreement with other comments , open shelving is pretty but I can only imagine the cleaning &amp; dusting you 'd have do to keep everything looking nice , not to mention the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I could see me doing it if I had a small beach cottage or pretty vacation home in the mountains , or even a hip trendy apartment back before kids . In my home nowover my dead body ! I have accumulated too many " good " gadgets . My dish displaying is limited to my fun bright everyday fiesta ware dishes , and even they are in a primitive cabinet behind the glass . <p> Loved Virginia Moms comment " There is a reason they put doors on cabinets . I believe it is to give the plastic food containers and drive-thru cups the privacy they need to multiply prodigiously . " So true . I have to say I would n't want anyone to get a look inside my Tupperware cabinet ! <p> My other issue with open shelving is that its my kids job to put the dishes away each night , and I 'd rather not have to fuss with each dishs placement and whether or not things are artistically arranged . Ha . <p> However , I LOVE the look of them and am drooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few shelves in my kitchen like this , but I 'd still need plenty of storage behind closed doors . : - ) <p> I love the way they look , but also wonder about keeping everything dust-free . Also , since I live in southern California , I dread to see what would happen after an earthquake . I still shudder when I remember what a mess the 1994 quake made at Cost Plus World Market . ( I was an employee there at the time . ) <p> I really like the thought of a mix of the twothe perfectionist side of me would love to have the open shelves with my beautiful things on display and then the realist side of me speaks up and says hey lady you have three kids 4 and underyou do not have pretty things nor time to make sure it looks perfectSo if I could have a few open to display the FEW pretty things I do have and closed cabinets to cover the MANY used , cracked , I mean loved items then I think its a win win for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open shelving down low for the daily items , especially if children help set the table . However , where am I supposed to put my spices ? My canned goods ? ( I suppose we can assume I have a pantry for this ? ) . I 'm with the others , though . TOO MUCH DUSTING ! <p> I do love the look of open shelving in magazines and such but I don-t know how I-d pull that off in my home . Sure ; I have pretty stuff that I-d love to display but where would I put the stuff that belongs to the kitchen but maybe isn-t that pretty ? And how much grease would get stuck on everything ( no matter how much you clean the kitchen it does get greasy ) ? <p> So I love the look but think I-d stick with having just a couple of open shelves in my own home just for the prettiness. : - ) <p> How about board and batten in the trend series ? I really want to do some form of it , but my baseboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a year old , this is not practical ! I would keep dreaming about it if I knew it was a KEEPER : ) <p> I love open shelving and have been tempted to get out the screwdriver to remove my cabinet doors many times . I do have that pretty red Fiesta afterall . <p> But I have pets ; hair is a problem no matter how proactive we are . I can just imagine myself pulling down a bowl off that beautiful shelf only to have it full of hair and dust . Unfortunately , this just wo n't work . I 'm convinced open shelving is always staged or in show homes . And I , most certainly , do not live in a show home . <p> I definitely think its practical in real life ! Encourages organization and the cutting down of items that you do n't  need . Besides , you could always do a mix and have door units on the bottom for stuff like plastic containers , water bottles , etc . I have an open pantry and l-o-v-e it . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I painted my cabinets and did n't  put some of them back on . I have n't really had a problem with dustthere are three shelves in each cabinet , the top shelf holds seldom used items and the lower two shelves hold everyday dishes/glasses . The everyday dishes get used too often to get dusty . The top shelf does get a bit dusty , but its a foot over my head and I cant tell from where I stand . I just give the items a quick rinse on the rare occasion I need to use them . <p> I agree , a mix of open shelving and closed for practicalitys sake is a must . However , I have to smile a bit because what is old becomes new again in fashion . I look at some make overs and I see styles that were once the bomb and now , the owner wants to destroy them . I grew up with the 50s look and it is coming back on many posts . I do n't  have a problem with that at all , but mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been distressed and have chippy white paint . The new owners will probably strip the pieces and try to recapture the previous look of the wood . And , I 'm not saying this as an old grump , I just have seen a lot of fashion styles come and go . My own style depends on a mix of items , I have pieces that I bought 35 years ago that I still love and some items that I got rid of that I wish I had kept . Oh , well . <p> We have three half circle shelves on the side of our kitchen island and I have no idea how to decorate it . Cute in show homes but not in mine . I like diiferent fun coffee mugs and they would look terrible out in the open ! <p> Worst trend of the moment is wallpaperbluck. againcute in magazines but not in person ! <p> I LOVE open shelving and I have two long LACKS sitting in my kitchen waiting to replace my current cabinetry . But I 'm very scared because we have three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid it will make it look too crowded and cluttered . <p> In my mind I would love to simply display dishes that are for decoration or for special occasions but we do n't  own either lol So the whole open shelving is on hold for the moment . But the pictures you posted have inspired me again and given me hope on the impracticality of open shelving . Ill probably have to shave the cats before we install the shelving though . Yikes . <p> i have open shelving and although i love the look , i am thinking of adding glass doors . i live in a very dusty area and while the dishes are used everyday , they have no time to gather dust- its the shelves themselves that are the dust gatherers ! i am constantly removing dishes from all the shelves to clean them ! <p> I actually had some open shelving in my kitchen ( which we just finished remodeling ) . While it looked great and was a nice place to display pretty serving dishes and glassware , it was not practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture above with paneling behind the shelves and everything became coated in cooking residue and then dust on top of that . While the cook books took the worst of the residue , its not very pretty on glassware either . <p> Now that we have an entirely new kitchen , we have no open shelving and I do miss displaying my nice serving dishes but I do n't  miss taking out wine glasses and having to clean them . Glass fronts on a few cabinets would be the best way to go ( or a china cabinet ? ) . <p> I love the look but also wonder about how it actually works . I 've heard designers say its practical because everything you use regularly is out in the open and easy to grab . But , then it would look bare and empty while you 're actually eating ( like when you have people over , which is when I really want my home to look " styled " ) . On the flip side , if you style them for beauty putting only display items or seldomly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  think many of us have room in our kitchens for that . Are n't  we all always looking for more storage solutions ? <p> I would love it in a beach cottage where easy living is really the number one priority . Guests could easily find what they want and have NO excuse not help put away the dishes ! So when it comes to open shelving I figure its like everything else in lifegood in moderation . <p> I think cabinets have doors for a reason as well but two or three open shelves with carefully chosen accessories would enhance any space . I have a friend with an open-shelved kitchen ( uppers ) and her complaint is that bowls and such get " dusty " from every day life and she often has to re-wash even every day wares because they 're not kept behind closed doors . I 'm not a fan of clutter so I like closed door cabinetry myself . <p> When I clean the top of refrigerator ( which is n't that often ) I 'm astounded at how all that greasy like dust gets up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . When I see all of those open shelves I think of all that hard to clean dust that you 'd have to deal with cleaning . Its not like dusting the furniture its thicker . Anyone else know what I 'm talking about ? Beautiful and if its not directly in the cooking area but say in the breakfast room area I think it would be a big deal . **they all look gorgeous though ! <p> GREAT post ! I just lived a year with open shelving and have to say that I LOVED it . I am not a type A person when it comes to keeping things immaculately clean though ( I 'm probably a B+ ) and would rather have the " pretty " of the open shelves and live with a little dust , etc. than have everything neat and clean behind closed doors . So maybe it is a personality thing . Some of my fancier dishes are always just there on display and the rest get regular use . I also have things like baskets , cookbooks , etc. that are there all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this weekend into a summer beach cottage we just bought and are going to be " cosmetically renovating " and I am putting open shelving in the kitchen for sure . I think an important consideration is that you can have a gorgeous kitchen with open shelving for a fraction of the cost of beautiful full cabinetry . Shelves + brackets at Home Depot= reasonable DIY . For that I will put in a little extra elbow grease to keep things dusted and organized . ; ) <p> I debated how to vote in the poll . I do think open shelving is popular right now but that it is also timeless-so that saves it from being classified as " trendy " for me . That said , I can certainly see people looking back in 30 years and saying " they took down solid cabinetry to install SHELVES ! ? ! ? " in the same manner that we look back on the 1950s and say " they put wall to wall carpeting over that gorgeous heart pine floor ! ! ? ? " <p> Time will tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of my open shelves : ) <p> I absolutely LOVE the look of it , but know that I would be too obsessive about things being greasy or dusty all the time ! I 've had some plates hanging on my wall , but I had to wipe them down every week or so or theyd be gross ! Ca n't imagine what happens with the shelves where people just leave it sitting there for ages if they do n't  get used ! <p> I live in a very old and run down rental in need of some renovation but here in Australia you do n't  renovate rentals as there is no cost benefit . Having said that my kitchen is mostly open shelves and even though they get dusty , the items on them are the ones I use often so it is not such a big problem , I do have one shelf that is for my retro pretty things but I also use them sometimes and they are the first thing you see when you walk in the door so I like it . I would go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , it just looks so nice . <p> I absolutely LOVE the look of open shelving in kitchensin magazines . When I was remodeling my own little kitchen , and I removed the doors from my cabinets , I considered leaving them off on one side for the open cabinet look . That all changed when I walked into my kitchen one day and saw this ( first picture ) . <p> So , I love the idea , love the look , but I 'll just have to enjoy them in perfectly-staged , beautifully-styled magazine pictures . I think for most households , they 're simply not practical . <p> LOVE THIS ! To me its timeless and trendy , and i can only vote for one , so I did choose timeless ! If done right , it brings me back to Little House days . Honestly , though , on the trendy viewpoint , I am a former caterer , and open shelving is a must when flying thru the kitchen . One day I will have my open shelving , until then , I simply have removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! ) lol ! And dusting yep . live on a dirt road . wipe things down once a week , and always before company ! Thanks for the post ! <p> I totally agree with what Jen had to say ; combined closed cabinet with 1 or 2 the open ones . You can then put your prettiest china with other accessories . This open shelving is for one person kitchen or two with your loving husband , and a dust free environment . Not with children . It is not practical . But it is pretty though the way they display it , I must say . <p> Oh , also , I forgot lol the REASON were doing the shelving upper is partly to open up the kitchen but mostly to force us to live with less , and more minimal . Its a full on lifestyle that we have been slowly moving towards , buying less , giving away excess and the shelving uppers help . I hate clutter but we have it . it wont be in the kitchen shelving now i cant comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a tiny little kitchen with only two open cabinets . Canvas bins filled w/extra glasses and mugs ae on the top shelves . The bottom and middle shelves have plates , mugs , glasses , serving bowls , pot holders , etc . It stays tidy because its just my hubby and myself and since I 'm a visual person , I make a point to keep it tidy ! <p> Its a matter of function : right by the stove ? no. everything would be splattered with cooking grime before you know it . <p> I actually took the doors off most of our uppers because i kept whacking myself in the face with them . I do n't  regret it . For our setup , its a million time better . The secret to keeping everything neat is to not have too much of any one thing and to put things back where they came from . <p> I love this look specifically , the BHG kitchen with the blue beadboard and white shelving . We plan to do a kitchen makeover and those photos are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can manage to keep thing clean and dust free if I just do a little each day . We have a small kitchen , so would have small sections of open shelving . I agree , still need some closed off storage for the not so pretty stuff but I try to buy mostly pretty stuff for my kitchen anyway ! <p> I love the look of them and think they make a kitchen look FRESH , but after our cats killed a few vases and frames on the open shelves in our bathroom AND murdered a pretty but dainty champagne flute ( one of the cats jumped into the cupboard when we were unloading the dishes and sauntered around ) , I definitely know that open shelving is n't for us . <p> The house were buying has this weird blank stretch of wall space that were planning on putting LACK shelves + corbels up to hide/ make it look intentional . We wont be taking any doors off the cabs though because my big butt cat would attempt to sleep in them just like Kristis ! Except my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all my fault ! <p> The shelves were putting up are up too high from the counter for him to jump ( its above the sink so they will be mounted a bit higher than the lines of the cabinets ) . Well probably put pretty dishes up there and just let the dust accumulate for a few weeks . I 'm not an anal cleaner , and that room is so badly lit ( for now ) I could get away with it . <p> I love the look.I just do n't  know how practical it is in a very busy kitchen with lots of little people ; ) Plus.I would think you would have to be sure to dust the entire shelf.because I would think grease in the air and dust would settle easily . But I do love this look ! <p> I have to agree with most of the commentsTOO much dust to leave dishes out . I cook at home everyday and even though the dishes get used a lot they still get dusty .. kids , dog hair ( &lt;I know gross huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pets .. <p> I LOVE the look but it 's just not for our home . I also think unless you have a 100K kitchen , those just would n't look as good in the avg. everyday kitchen . I have NEVER been to any persons ' home with a kitchen as nice as these .. I know you have a fabulous kitchen but I do n't think the majority of people even come close to that kind of glam . A person just has to have " that " kind of home and style throughout their house to pull it off . If not they just look like ghetto cabinets without doors .. LOL <p> We had open shelving in our first apartment . Uhh I never dusted . Maybe I am a gross , dust-loving person . I loved the look . Open shelving on top , closed on the bottom . Love it . The best of both worlds . <p> Love this post and love open shelving ! We took some doors off the upper cabinets in the house that we fixed up for my grandad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dishes and food were . Then we ended up liking it so much we took off the rest of the upper doors . We still have the doors on the bottom cabinets and that 's working out great . I think one of the reasons it works well is that its a small kitchen so taking off the doors opened the space . Also , since were starting from scratch , there are n't  a lot of extra dishes and gadgets yet . <p> But I do totally understand the tupperware problem . The good thing about starting fresh in this house has been controlling the tupperware . We recycle what we do n't  need and try to keep the reproduction at a minimum : ) <p> Hi KateWe have open shelving in our kitchen ( 1920s , Craftsman-style home ) . I love itpractical , easy , and uncluttered . The secret is buying your dishes and glassware in all the same colors . I recently did a blog post on our kitchenyou can see our real-life , everyday-use kitchen here : <p> I have always had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking doors off of cabinets even in rental apartments . Not all though . One or two to display pretty bowls and cookbooks and decorative items . I like the way it breaks up the upper cabinets and gives the eye something more interesting to look at than a flat door . For everyday items I actually have a plate rack hanging on the wall not the same , I know , but I painted it to match when I painted all of my kitchen cabinets and it looks great , even when the plates are in use or in the dishwasher . I love the look of the open shelves you show above , but WOW the dust ! Love your blog ! Keep up the good work . <p> Why would anyone want to create more chores for themselves ? It looks great in a magazine shoot , but I have better things to do than dust and rewash dishes . A small display shelf is enough to catch the trend in my opinion . <p> I 'm with all those who say this is a trend . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of my stuff on a shelf for the world to see . I ca n't be the only one who occasionally leaves clean/dirty dishes in the dishwasher or sink for more than a day . Just like you said , Kate- what about the empty spaces on the shelves for the items being used ? <p> I love the look , but in earthquake country ( do you feel me , CG ? ) I would be paranoid all day long ! I guess I could fake the upper shelves by using museum putty under the contents , and be prepared to lose the whatever is on the lowers , which would be the frequently used things and would n't collect dust . Any ideas how to have my cake and safely eat it too ? <p> I am not a fan of upper cabinets . My dream kitchen in my dream house , would have a perfectly organized pantry to store most of the things I would put in upper cabinets . I would have some open shelving for day to day stuff . I just feel that upper cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather look out a large window than look at upper cabinets . <p> Ive been reading your blog for months , but have n't ever commented . Goodness , I did n't  even know design type blogs existed until I started doing internet research for our kitchen remodel back in January ! I think I may have visited them all now , but I 'd like you to know that your blog is one of only a few that has stayed in my favorites as a daily visit . Can I take a minute to tell you all that I love about your blog ? I marvel at your energy ! Seems like you accomplish so much and you blog about so many different things.home reno , crafts , food , design , etc.very Martha Stewart-ish in that you have a variety of knowledge and talents and your " delivery " is very professional . I also appreciate that you post nearly every day . Your BOTB is such a smart feature addition because it brings me here even on the weekend , when most everyone else has taken the weekend off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , uncluttered . I also think the way that you have your blog posts set up is the best . You show a good amount of the post before I must click " rest of the entry " so that I can make an informed decision whether I want to read the rest if I 'm in a hurry . I find the blogs that only show a couple sentences of each post , or those that may show a full post for one or two of the most recent , but then require me to make an extra click to see if I even want to read older posts , to be frustrating . May sound lazy , but I do n't  have all that much time and the fact that you make it easy for me to read your blog is a detail that has not gone unnoticed . <p> All that said , onto the topic at hand ! We are at the tail end of the aforementioned kitchen remodel , but I 'm still waiting for my open shelves to be hung . Ill have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan is for all the dishes , glasses and most frequently used serving &amp; mixing bowls to occupy them , with the top-most , out-of reach shelf more for decorative items . I have 6 children and we go through nearly every dish every day , so it does n't  seem like its going to be impractical for us . I 've loved the look of displaying pretty dishes for years and years.I cant wait to display all my Fire King bowls and Fiesta dishes ! I 've spent the last year collecting them and color coordinating . I voted in your poll that open shelves are timeless because kitchens long ago did n't  have upper cabinets ! Its just coming back around because its just that- timeless . I do n't  think theyll ever go completely out of style again the same way that upper cabinets wont ever go out of style , it will just be a matter of preference . I also find it , for us , a purposeful move towards simplicity . I 'm hoping it helps keep me from keeping things hidden in cabinets that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to youKim <p> When we moved into our current apartment I was brain storming ways to make the small kitchen feel bigger and be more functional . I ended up taking a few sets of cabinet doors off . I added a fake backsplash ( fabric wrapped cardboard ) to add some color and visual interest . I love it now ad would n't change a thing ! I 'm going to create a blog post about my finished kitchen some time this week after I take a few pictures ( if I can ever get the kitchen to stay clean ! ) <p> Yikes , I can not believe " trendy " is leading . We have open shelving in our kitchen . We gutted our kitchen four years ago and I still love the remodel ! Our house is old ( 115+ victorian ) and our kitchen is small , so mixing open shelving with cabinets was the best option . Yes , you must dust , but its not that big of a deal . And if you have empty spaces because of items in use that 's fine too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ugh sure it looks okay , but really ? ? I 'm not going to worry about gaps or how it looks when I 'm you know actually using my dishes , but what about dust ? ? ! I really do n't  want to have to rinse off every single plate or bowl before I use it because of dust build up or a fly died in there or something <p> Now DRAWERS are a kitchen feature I love . Almost all of my base cabinets are drawers , and I could n't be happier . All of my plates and bowls are stored in drawers as opposed to uppers , and they 're so much easier to access . <p> With a family of 11 , most of the time most of my stuff is in use , in the sink , or in the dishwasher . My open shelves would be empty . Not to mention I live in the country , where many bugs and flies find their way into the sink and surrounding area at nightI read a blog once where a lady found a snake in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of finding a big hairy wolf spider in the bottom of my coffee mug , or crickets or tree frogs finding their way in the glasses at night.yeacchhh ! I 'll keep my cabinet doors , thanks ! <p> AS for what else is trendy/timeless ? How about Stainless Steel appliances ? I keep hearing people say they are a fad , while I think they are timeless and perhaps more popular now than they were , and perhaps will be , but they will always look good and be in style <p> I like the open shelving but only if it looks very neat and organized . The all white dishes displays or mostly white with strategically placed pops of color are nice . I would n't choose it instead of cupboards though only in addition to them . : ) I need to hide my clutter . ; ) <p> I love the look , but I think its impractical for the way I live . I 'm a cleanliness nut so the idea of dishes sitting out on a shelf and then being used would drive me crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . LOL Plus the dusting required does n't  seem appealing . <p> I have one open shelf behind my stove that I keep the pepper mill , bottles of oil and a couple of decorative items on , and that 's enough for me . <p> I think they look great , but seem impractical for everyday life . It looks so pretty when its styled , but what about when all your dishes are in the dishwasher ? And who wants extra stuff to dust ? ! Not me ! <p> I too love the look but as a few have mentioned before I think what keeps open shelving neat , simple , etc is the dishes in the photos above appear to be beautiful , complete sets in complimentary or coordinating colorsnot the mustard yellow mixed with what 's left from our first black and creme set : ) <p> I love , love , love , LOVE this post and am so glad someone is finally asking this question . I have been drooling over the look of open shelving and even have an entire Pinterest board dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack over my island and feared the same outcome with open shelving . First of all , I do n't  have enough cutesy , matchy , or all white dishes that would be " open shelf worthy " . Also , how totally embarrassing would it be to pull down a serving platter or whatever when you have company only to find dust and who-knows-what on it . I know this because my pots , even though they are used often , collect dust on the potrack . I waste more time washing them before I use them ! <p> So , I will continue to love the look , but do n't  think its practical for me . Also , has anyone mentioned the resale value of your home ? I 'd be afraid to remove a bunch of cabinets and then people who are n't  into this look would ditch your home if you were trying to sell . Do n't  they say that kitchens and baths are what sell your home ? <p> Oh and I 'd also like to see your readers ideas on white kitchen cabinets ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , board and batten , and generally neutral colored decor . I happen to love all of those things , but I wonder if home decor , like hairstyles or fashion , can go in-out-and-back-into style , or is the home decor of today constant evolving ? <p> Open shelves look pretty but not real . All your dishes and glasses and bowls need to be there to make it look right , so you need other dishes to really use . Sort of like those glass jars of lemons " for a color pop " which would rot within a day . ( hello what are they thinking ? ) Its all for some " look " for a moment in time instead of a practical work place . It is so fake ! <p> I agree that most of these kitchens look pretty fake . Wheres the pasta sauce splattered all over the stove , or the coating of flour on everything from baking ? My husband is a fantastic chef but a very messy one so stuff ca n't be out on the counters . Or open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardens shot with the shelving surrounding the stove dust would n't be nearly the problem as that grease crud that gets on everything in the vicinity of the stove , including the ceiling . That is a pain in the neck to scrub off ! <p> I love the look of open shelving in the kitchen , especially when its a less contemporary design as it feeds into the whole casual cottage thing I love . But while I know I 'd have no problem keeping them organized , I 'd be worried about dust . Dusting is one of my least favorite chores and one of my biggest pet peeves , especially when it comes to the kitchen . So I 'd personally pick a happy medium of upper cabinets with glass doors . <p> I guess I 'm in the minority , as I despise open shelving . I 'm one of those people who prefers to have things out of sight . Our house is a mass of boxes , drawers , and other " hiders " because I have issues with visual clutter . I think open shelves are great for art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ druthers , I 'd even put my books behind closed doors on their shelves : ) <p> I feel like the open shelving is a pretty trendy look , and though it looks lovely in a magazine , I 've recently redone my kitchen and opted to keep the existing cupboard , but install some glass fronts in two of them , rather than go with all open shelving . The deciding factor , was that my man and I watched our children getting dishes to set the table one night . ( My kiddos are ages 8 and 10 ) They were like little monkeys , jumping up on the counters , and grabbing the edges of doors to balance as they walked from the cups to the bowls I could visualize an entire shelf of my stoneware crashing to the ground amidst tears and frustration . We have been so happy with glass fronts instead , and its been a good reminder that keeping a few cluttery and mis-matched items hidden is a good thing ! <p> I looks so charming and " warm " to me . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrens books , where there 's a fire going at all times and the big bear owns two of each thing ( plates , cups , forks , pans , etc ) . With that amount of things , of course itd be easy to keep it tidy ! HOWEVER , I could never keep all my kitchen stuff that tidy AND dust-free ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'd hate to have to wipe off every plate before using it ! <p> I like the look but judging from the greasy film on my mixing bowls up on an open shelf , I think one shelf of everyday stuff is all I could handle I just would n't want to be constantly washing everything ! <p> Open shelving looks so pretty but I am short and I just cant reach those upper shelves . I keep most of the dishes and other items I use on the lower shelves so I wont have to grab a step stool . <p> You asked for some suggestions for the " Timeless and Trendy " series so here are a few more to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted woodwork ; arm chairs at a dining room table ( Are n't  wingback chairs difficult to move to/from the table ? What about the food getting smeared on the white chairs ? ) ; Birds on pillows , curtains , dressers , buffets , everywhere ; vases with dead tree limbs stuck in it . : - ) <p> Thank you for todays post . I have been planning a kitchen update and the bhg open selving picture is exactly what I want . I 'm so excited . I have been mulling this over for a while and cant wait to get started . However , mine will not include open selving ( sorry to say ) . I do have one cabinet with a glass door and I plan to " update " this by adding vintage seed glass . <p> What Ive found to be the key to easy maintenance open shelving in a kitchen are : 1 ) Keep them away from your cooktop mine are on the wall to the left of my sink above my dishwasher so when I unload I just put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 ) Put out dishes that you like to look at and that you use daily . This way , they get used and washed daily and you do n't  have to worry about dust or grime . My dishes are a combo of white and light apple green . <p> 3 ) I stack my white dishes together and green dishes and have them organized in a pretty way . Now everyone is so used to it , that stacking them back after they 've been washed is easy-peasy . <p> I 'm slightly OCD when it comes to cleanliness and organization and I really , REALLY love my open shelves . Its very practical for our family and I have n't had any issues with dust or dirt or anything ! <p> Sometimes a little impracticality is worth it for the aesthetics . However , not in this instance . Grease and dust just do n't  seem like good playmates with open shelving . Plus , I 'm short and oftentimes just kinda throw ( plastic ) bowls toward the upper shelves- the only shelf I can reach comfortably is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na be pretty . I 'd rather save up for gorgeous cabinets and tile . But , I do love looking at all the open shelving designs , I just know it would never work for me . : ) <p> It feels too cluttered for my taste . Plus the dust factor would drive the OCD out of the closet for me . Oh and the 2nd pic where you said you 'd need a footstool ? I think that 's what may be hidden in those lower drawers under the sink cabinets . So you 're good to go ! <p> A mix of traditional cabinets and open shelving makes the most sense I think . Plus , if you 're ever planning on putting your house on the market , I would think open shelves would deter buyers . Kitchen cabs are expensive , you know ! Shelving is beautiful , but I think the only people who can get away with it are those who pay a kitchen staff to keep it clean . <p> i actually have open shelving in my kitchen , but its in the eating area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes , etc. i love it , and definitely want to mix that with regular cabinets someday in our forever house . <p> I lived with open shelving for 2 years in our first apt here in Germany and hated it with a passion . My husband is the clean freak , not me , but even I was going nuts over the amount of dust that collected . Do n't  even get me started on the kitchen grease that made everything so sticky and opaque ( we cook healthy and even had a fan , but since it was n't external , maybe it was n't enough ? ) -and our shelves were on the opposite wall ; I wont tell you what became of the vases and cake stands that were over the stove <p> We eventually hung a cable with fabric panel curtains to try to protect things on the main wall of shelves ( and hide some of the visual clutter ) and it helped a fair amount . The top shelves were still always bad though . <p> The only section of open shelving that was fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking glasses . We slid them in and out and the dust slid off with all the action . But there was always dust around the stacks of bowls and plates we used everyday . <p> I love the look , but i couldnt live with it . I have visual clutter issues and it would be too much for me . I have a hutch that I display some vintage jadeite and some vintage Limoge dishes that I do n't  often use , but that is it . I dust them once a week . I think the look works if everything you have matches or goes well together . Unfortunately , I have a husband and son who love Tupperware cups that I would n't want to be displayed . I am going to relace some doors with seeded glass panels to display some of my vintage stuff , but not my everyday stuff . <p> I could drool over them all day long too ! I love the look ! I 'm with you , however , on it being too hard to maintain . Not to mention I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach everything ! Youd have to make sure every thing that you use in the kitchen matches your decor , also . I do n't  know about everyone else , but things like my toaster and can opener are n't  pretty enough to be on display ! I like the idea of having SOME open shelves to hold things that are pretty , the other things you can hide ! <p> I like the look in catalogs but it would n't work for me in everyday life . Maybe in a beach cottage vacation home . I agree with the comments about dusting and cookingand , my dishes are not the collection that I dream about either One other thing I notice is that it really depends on the kitchen space . Sometimes I feel like the shelves do not balance the space and the lower cabinets end up looking clunky and the upper space feels like it is " lost " . not sure that makes alot of sense to anyone but me.LOL Just my 2 cents ! Blessings Abundant ! <p> I think the chevron print is so treandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog without seeing it ! I like a mostly classic home with punches of trendiness so it is easy to remove those items when they become dated . You do a good job of keeping your home classic with hints of trendy . Great job ! <p> I ADORE the look and can see me rocking it in my kitchen IF I had no husband , children or dogs . I know if I lived all alone ( where would be the fun in that ? ! ) I could maintain this pretty look ! However , with a 2 year old and 2 dogs underfoot , anything " pretty " lasts for about 10 minutes . Also , my husband would never keep the look maintained . He would grab something pretty perhaps a display item and put peanuts in them and take it out to the garage . Also , on the occasions where he empties out the dishwasher ( he s pretty good ! ) , he s never know where to put everything . ( I 'm one of those people that opens the cabinet doors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups are going to topple over on your head ! <p> All in all , I love the look , but I 'm with the " its too impractical " crowd . Beautiful pics and design , though ! <p> Okay , I am loving my open shelves . Kinda scared to say that , though , lol . We do have our stove in the island , so there 's no direct cooking ( grease , dust , etc , ) directly under our dishes , etc . I removed my cabinet doors in Jan , so there 's a casing to protect them a little . I have 2 toddlers , so for me , I thought it would be impossible , but it just made me reorganize and shift things around . I cleaned out a huge drawer filled with appliances , gadgets we never used and sippy cups , travel mugs , and plastic cups went there . I added a couple of baskets to hide a few plastic cups in the open shelving.and got rid of twenty-something sippy cupsand we still have 15 ! Talk about unnecessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the one place that stays clean is my kitchen ( shelves , in particular ) . Everything has its place , and its quite simple to keep it that way . My husband loves tervis tumbler plastic cups , and you know , one or two of those might stay out , but that 's no big deal to me . We just put them away for parties/company . That 's been my fun success with open shelveslove them.will always have them in at least some part of my kitchen . : ) Heres the link.fun topic , friend ! : - ) <p> After we painted our cabinets , we went a few days with open cabinets . I like the way it looked and it made our small kitchen look so much bigger . For a second , I thought about keeping it that way . We just did n't  have enough space for the things that needed to stay behind doors , like sippy cups and less used items . <p> I love the open shelving in my kitchen . All of my clear glass and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since we use these items everyday their washed just about daily , so dust have time to collect . It also makes it easier for children unloading , and putting away the dishes . : ) All my mismatch glasses , and sippy cups are in the cabinet hidden . : ) <p> When building our home this was also a budget cutter for usshelves were less expensive than cabinets . <p> We removed the cabinet doors to the top kitchen cabinets at my last house and they looked beautiful . But those were all-wood custom cabinets built in the 50s . In my current home ( built in the 80s ) , the inside of the cabinet is n't in as good condition . We recently considered buying floating shelves and removing the cabinets until we noticed that the shelves had a 15 lb weight limitjust not practical . <p> I do think that open shelves are trendy at the moment , but I also think they 're practical enough for the long haul . I think that the key to using open shelves is to have ample closed upper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in the kitchen that are n't  open-shelf-friendly , like tupperware . So as long as you have enough space to store all of the things that you do n't  want out in the open , I think that open shelves are an excellent way to accessorize with functional items like dishes . I love collecting beautiful dishes , and my glass front and open shelves make me smile when I see all of the interesting finds and gifts Ive collected over time . <p> Love the look of the open shelving and may actually incorporate it into my kitchen , but I am concerned about the dust on the items that are used less frequently . I live in Middle TN and believe me , we have the dust ! We are installing T-111 on the walls and painting it a beautiful red that matches my red Fiesta Ware dishes . It will look similar to your 3rd pic , only RED . Lower cabinets will be beautiful glossy white . Upper " cabinets " will either be glass front or open shelving , depending on how my budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward butcher block counter tops on at least some of my counters . Hard surface ( soapstone ? ) on others . The good thing about being a DIYer is that you can try different things and/or change them , at a lower cost than having someone do the work for you . <p> I do love the look of open shelves , but I live on 13 acres in El Dorado County . If I had open shelves , I 'd be washing dishes forever before and after using them ! No thanks . I did , however , once paint a regular ol cabinet door to look like an open shelf tuscan style which was fun for me and the client . Nice trompe loeil and the best of both worlds : D <p> Speaking of murals . . . that 's my one comment on DesignStar . The guy who painted the tree " mural " won the challenge . Cmon Kate . The idea was nice but some tape on the wall ? Yes , it added verticality . But what about the staircase/nook area that Kellie treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she added style and warmth . Other than that , I was in total agreement with Julia . <p> Oh , wait . . . tea light thingies on the wall ? And she was the one who was so concerned with who was certified ? ! ? oopsie daisie . <p> I move into a fairly large apartment 8+ years ago and it was so fab that I ignored the fact that it had a serious lack of kitchen/cupboard space . I have two narrow cabinets on either side of the stoveneither are suitable for dishes . The sink side of the kitchen has a pantry cupboard ( very cool ) floor to almost ceiling on one side and the requisite under-sink cupboard . <p> My solution was to create a wall-to-wall open shelf system combined with a coffee prep and microwave area in the large dining room area . I used an antique vanity that is desk/table height flanked by two tall bookshelves . The system has worked for me for the entire time I 've lived here . It holds all my dishes , coffee mugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1995 to now . <p> Yes , things get dusty but I do keep up with that trying to use my bakeware on a regular basis . For purely practical reasons , I managed to create a system that works every day and is esthetically pleasingwithout breaking my budget . <p> I think open shelving , which I love , is currently *hot* but it has been around a long time so its also classic . I can use both my grandparents homes as an example . My dads parents lived in a home in a major city in the deep south . There was some open shelving in the kitchen on either side of the sink . But she also cabinets with solid doors ( no glass ) . The pretty every day colorful dishes and platters were on the open shelves and all the things she did n't  want to be seen , as well as her formal china , were behind the closed cabinet doors . My moms parents lived in an old farmhouse in central Florida . It was also built in the 30s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sink at her farm home . It was loaded with dishes , etc. and always looked fantastic to me . That old farmhouse is still lived-in by a family member and the shelving is going strong and still looks great . So it has been around at least since the 30s . <p> I felt like I was missing an option : ) ( indecisive much ? ) I SOMETIMES love the look if it is the right arrangement in the right style . The staged photos are almost always pleasant to look at but I ca n't help but wonder about dust . So few things in my kitchen cabinets are truly used every day . I also think I would get overwhelmed by seeing so many items day in and day out also . I like the simplicity of a cabinet vs. stacks of dishes/cups for the most part . <p> For the average family , this would n't work . Most people do n't  have the type of dishes that could be displayed like these pictures ( which are beautifully staged , but staged nonetheless ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leftover dishes from sets long ago retired . The plastic cups we use more than the glassware because the kids and pets knock them over on a regular basis . These are the real life instances when cabinetry is necessary . Now do n't  get me wrong , I love a good glass door every now and then to display the dishes that DO match . Or the the wine glasses and mugs that add that classic feel . But floating shelves are a definite no-go for me . They look great in pictures , but just do n't  make sense for my style eclectic clutter . <p> I just built a small kitchen for my apartment on the bottom floor of my daughters house . I LOVE it ! All my dishes and serving items are white so it all looks nice . The shelves are above the sink and I especially like the convenience of everything being so accessible . Yes there is a bit if dust on the front part of the white shelves but i dust that easily with a micofiber wand . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding much dust on the dishes . And I LOVE the look makes the space seem larger and more open and inviting . Everyone who has seen this little kitchen thinks it is sooo charming ! <p> I took all the cabinet doors off in my apartment . They do n't  look very attractive , but they *are* very practical for me . I have difficulty visualizing what is in which cabinet , so I end up opening every door , looking for what I need ! <p> The photos are not realistic at all , IMO . There are dishes , sure , but what about everything else ? Cereal ? Spices ? Pasta ? I do n't  know many kitchens with enough storage to waste all the space on what is basically little more than decor . The idea could be very practical , OR it could be purely aesthetic . I 'm doubtful it could be both . <p> We have open shelving and I love it ! I only put things on the shelves that we actually use so everything gets used often enough that dust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all shoved in haphazardly . Its organized and coordinated and lovely , but easy to put everything back in its place so that it stays that way . If I could afford glass doors instead , I may do that . But for now , taking the cabinet doors off was a free way to revamp my kitchen . And even with glass doors , it still has to stay looking nice ! <p> I have never been a big fan of open shelving in the kitchen . Even when items are attractively displayed , its too much visual clutter for me . I like things behind closed doors . Also , having to make sure everything always looked nicely arranged all the time would drive me crazy ! : - ) <p> we live in a small house with a small galley kitchen . one of the first thing i did was remove the cabinets on the sink side of the kitchen and put up simple white shelves . i love them . i way simplified when we downsized so what is on the shelves gets used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five and regular visitors cleaning is not a problem at all . it made a huge difference in the feel of our kitchen as well . i do have two small upper cabinets opposite those on either side of the stove/microwave that house spices and mixing bowls . ive found its all i need . this from someone who used to think i needed every inch of space in the 38 cabinets in our previous kitchen . <p> My biggest concern with open shelving in kitchens is DUST ! If you decorate it with your seldom used pretty entertaining dishes , then they collect dust while not in use then you have to rinse them off when you do use them . I think its really pretty though ! <p> I love the look but there is no way I 'd have open shelving in my kitchen . It would be just too much hassle because everything has to be just so in order for open shelves to look good . Plus , the idea of keeping all those dishes clean , and the amount of dish washing I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelving coffin for me . <p> Its cute , for sure , but really ? My wine glasses get dusty and they live IN the cabinets . And you know that fine mist of grease that can get on anything near the stove area that requires constant cleaningimagine that on everything . I think its so pretty to have open shelving , but it could not possibly be more impractical . I think the compromise is some cabinets with GLASS DOORS and interior lighting for areas that house the pretty dishes . That way you can see them and enjoy them without having to dust and wash them every week ! Just sayin ! ! <p> I love the look , but I think it will be a trendy thing . Though I do get how practical they can be for your everyday dishes &amp; cups and if you have collections that belong in the kitchen , its a great idea . It would n't work for my kitchen . I do n't  feel that I have a big enough kitchen or an airy enough kitchen to pull this off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on open shelving would be my everyday all white dishes and clear everyday glasses . Otherwise I want everything else behind solid cabinet doors . <p> I like open shelving and am considering them for the top cabinets my kitchen . My kitchen is really small and the cabinets are very tall 4 shelf making it hard to reach at 52.5 ? . I would best describe it as a hallway with my cabinets to your left and right and at then end is the stove ( like a I-shape cause there is one cabinet on the opposite end of the stove ) . Its actually seperated on addition to the house , next to the back porch . Since my stove is seperate from where the cabinets are I do n't  anticipate as much grime being a factor if the where a lot closer ( the tile near the stove , is a different story ) . Also , dust really does n't  bother me that much . For one , I always rinse my dishes/glasses/cups off before I use them and currently we have closed cabinets . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not OCD ( quite far from it actually ) but I find it odd that people would just use the plates/cups/utensils without rinsining them . <p> I love my glass doors on my cabinets . Not everywhere . Just a sprinkling . And no white-out on the glass . I love the look of mottled glass with a few bubbles here and there . And as for your end table , bring on that turquoise-ish blue ! ! ! ! Did I guess correctly ? BTW , Carmel by the Sea was to die for . As was Big Sur . I do not think I can cross them off my bucket list just yet because I must see them again . And again . Even though they are across the country . Thanks for the suggestions . <p> I think my stuff would get too dusty and greasy , like the items I keep on top of my shelveswith 5 kids , I just do n't  have time to do that much cleaning ! But , I LOVE the look of open shelvingespecially in rustic and country styles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off the doors on several caninets and painiing the insides to create open shelves . Not for me . It just ended up looking cluttery and messymaybe because behind closed doors I am cluttery and messy ! Real life , for me , is not an open shelf look . That being said , I admire the look in magazines . <p> My last home was a rental and the landlord had already removed all the cabinets on top before we moved in so we were forced to live with open shelving . I organized it and it looked pretty ok , but not everything I own is all matchy matchy nor is it all coordinated , so it felt a bit cluttery for my liking . Also kids dishes totally wreck the look ( oy the sippy cups ) . There was the dust thing too , but for us that was n't the biggest issue . It did make the small kitchen feel larger which was nice . I guess you just need to decide what 's more important for you . And if it wont bug you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at the shelves . <p> I had an open shelf cabinet built in my kitchen with the intent of using it for display space . I actually use it for my everyday white dishes &amp; love the fact they are out in the open . Since we use the dishes on top of each stack almost daily they do not get dusty . The only piece that I rinse before using is the gravy boat because I do n't  serve gravy very often . <p> If you have a kitchen that you do n't  actually cook in , the open shelves are lovely and charming . However , if you actually prepare food to cook and use your cooktop , they 're not very practical . Food is messy . You find it where you least expect it . Kitchens can get messy very quickly and open shelving would just be too much to maintain . <p> I can see using open shelving for something like a vacation home , or office , etc . But for everyday use at an everyday home ? I think its impractical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But I for one have too many dishes , etc I use everyday and for entertaining to not have my trusty upper cabinetry . But to have a few open shelves , for displaying knick knacks , vases etc , it makes sense . <p> I think it comes down to lifestyle . If you have dishes that you love and want to display and use all the time , then they are getting washed and wont have time to collect dust . I took cabinets down on one wall in my tiny galley kitchen because the kitchen is n't cute , its old and I think shelves will look better , plus open it up . Notice I said " will look better " . I get inspired and start projects that do n't  get finished quickly ! <p> I had my kitchen painted by my sister and her bf ( he s a contractor and helped with the floors and counters ) . I asked if I should get open shelves and she looked at me like I was nuts . The inside of my cabinets are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think to keep that looking good you have to be a minimalist and tall . I have my dishes in the pass through cabinet . Its a pain when I 'm unloading the dishwasher , but I 'm too short for me to reach the shelves . Cabinet is 25 inches high instead of the normal 18 inches . If the cabinets were dropped they would have been normal height . If I had the money I 'd have cabinets that went from the ceiling to 18 inches over the counter . As it is I have more cabinets than most but I can never reach anything with out a step-stool . I cant believe how many comments you got and here I 'm writing a novel . oops ! <p> I feel like we could be best friends lol . I have been looking at the open shelf kitchens lately because mine are so horrid . I defiantly think its timeless . that 's the way it was waaay back in the day . plus it gives you an excuse to have cool dishes and to change them often . what women does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for posting this today ! I have always loved open shelving and had forgotten about it for a long time since I had young kids . Well . Now that I no longer have young kids I am SO doing this ! ! ! I emailed my mom as soon as I saw this and said let 's get going on this next ! LOL I love this ! ! <p> One day I decided to take the cabinet doors off and display my collection of white dishes and serving pieces . I LOVED it . Hubby HATED it . I ended up putting the doors back on , but man , do I still love how it looked . You can see it here : <p> I love the look and I recently just switched over to some open cabinets . Only the ones for my pretty dishes that do get used every day . I made sure I did n't  open too many where I felt like I lost space due to having to keep to many open spaces clean an pretty . I made sure I was n't lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way but I 'm having a blast painting my cabinets , painting my floor and opening up some cabinets so its not one big wall of doors . <p> We have open shelving in our kitchenIm of two minds regarding hating it or liking it . I think it only looks nice when everything on the shelves is the same color or style . So , for now I store only white dishes on the shelves , and everything else goes into cabinets under the counters . <p> We 've removed the doors off our slanted cupboards and we love them . We painted the back of the cupboards a contrasting color navy . It helps that all our dishes , plates , bowls and mugs are white , and our glasses match . I have two baskets for that tupperware stuff lids in one , containers in the other . I also display my cookbooks , and have an elaborate spice shelf . I use another basket for " mix " packages , you know , gravy mix , spices packages , cheese sauce , what have you . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have dishes I enjoy seeing as well as Pyrex mixing bowls on another shelf . I do n't  mind when some are in use , because my kitchen is a work place . Just like in a restaurant kitchen , I want to grab what I need quickly . <p> I honestly get both sides of this debate but feel as if having open shelving would push me to simplify my life ! I look forward to the day when we can build or buy a home and choose open shelving : ) Time saved opening and shutting doors , no danger in hitting your head when someone leaves a door open , all white dishes , no obvious questions being asked about where do you keep your glasses , and imagine how much cheaper it would be to save on all that cabinetry ! ! ! ! <p> I love my restaurant style open shelving- nearly everyone who 's posted is right- it can be dusty and it needs to be organized to work but that does n't  mean it ca n't be functional . Proper planning can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too much in general but especially in the kitchen . I only kept what we really need and the mismatchy stuff ( cereal bowls or sippy cups ) store under the island- bakeware &amp; foodstuff in lower cabinets . When we renod the kitchen we wanted it to have an open look- removing the upper cabinets made it look brighter and spacey and it is not visually cluttered at all . But it does lends itself more to certain styles like modern or rustic- a traditional kitchen may not rock the look as well . Nor does it work for those who love to gadgets or cant give up a lot of stuff even if they do n't  use it regularly . In my case the wine glasses do get dusty because they are n't  used enough . But I found that they got dusty in my cabinet too and I still had to wash them before using . Now I will run them thru the dishwasher every couple of wks bc they 're on display . But its only 8 glasses and 3 decorative items that I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage . <p> i have 3 open shelves in my kitchen- we 've been here almost 2 years , and i still love them . i keep them pretty well filled unless we have a large group for dinner . then i just prop a platter or large bowl in the empty space to look pretty ! the only items that get dusty are the casserole dish , less used pitcher and stack of pretty vintage snack plates that i only use on occasion . they just rinse before use &amp; i 'm ready to go ! i love the shelves , but its like any other design feature i like it &amp; others do n't  &amp; that 's fine ! : ) <p> I 'm planning on open shelving in my kitchen . . . but its a very small space , and I will only put things on those shelves that I use often enough for them to not get dusty . ; o ) No staging necessary . The dishes will always be done b/c there wont be a dishwasher , and there is n't room on the counter for dirty ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long-term ( i.e. pretty-only , or occasional-use ) storage . Hello , extra work . I need spaces that conform themselves to the way I live so my time is n't consumed with serving objects instead of objects serving me ! <p> I had open shelves in a kitchen a few years ago and hated them . I had to get glass jars for all of my dry foods .. flour , pasta , etc , and keep all the cans and things under the counter where I had cabinets with doors . Everything had to be dusted at least weekly and washed every other week . That meant climbing up to the highest shelves and taking my stemware down . It was a hassle and a half . <p> My home was built in the 1950s and I love it but my kitchen cabinets were plain wood and went to the ceiling . Hated how closed off it made my tiny galley kitchen look so I removed the doors , filled the holes from the screws and painted the insides , outsides and backsplash ( beadboard ) all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are white with clear glasses . I have a few pewter pieces ( pitcher and cake stand etc ) showing as well but I love the look . Making my kids put dishes away neatly is not the easiest but its worth the 2 minutes to rearrange as it makes my kitchen look 100 times larger now . Would deff recommend it to anyone with a small kitchen . <p> In my current kitchen , I have a mix of open shelving , closed cabinets , and glass front cabinets . While it works for this room , I would much prefer having a large pantry for all of my dry goods , occasional use items ( for me baking dishes/pans would be in that category ) , and most better china . I would definitely keep the open shelving for often used items . I prefer a clean , spare kitchen and expanses of upper cabinet boxes are just too visually bulky for me , making the kitchen seem too closed-in and cluttered . I also really enjoy the area of the kitchen that needs upper cabinet essentially being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets are connected to the counter as a hutch . Massing storage seems more practical for the way I use my kitchen . I really do think that were about to see a revolution in kitchen design that will make our kitchens much more practical and attractive . Whatever works best for each of us in our own kitchens will be more important that having the traditional suburban American kitchen . <p> Uggggh open shelves ! Years ago , when I was about 13 , I wanted a summer job ( so industrious ! ) , so my aunt hired me to be her mothers helper/light housekeeping person . She had a modern house with lots and lots of open shelving , and one of my jobs was to clean err , SCRUB the open shelves . <p> It . Was . Disgusting . <p> My aunt and uncle cooked a lot , but did n't  have great ventiliation in the kitchen ( this was also about 1985 ) . Every bit of kitchen grease , dust , and general filth landed on the items on the open shelving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clean , to clean the shelves and every item on them . Did I mention that they had 2 full walls of open shelving ? <p> Honestly , the Martha pic is the most ridiculous in my opinion . I literally laughed out loud when I saw it . I 'm sure this is n't really her kitchen otherwise she has a real caffeine addiction going on . Because , honestly , who in their right mind would need 4 espresso makers , and there must be like 30 espresso cups there . Is she running coffee shop out of her home ? Sorry for the tangent just had to point out the ridiculousness of it ! <p> While agree the looks can be nice , making it look bigger and more open , my first thought was another spot to collect dust and/or grease . No thanx . If anything , I 'd have it for cookbooks and a few decorative items only in a very small area . <p> i 'm an American living in Sweden . Courtesy of the fact that EVERYONE has an IKEA kitchen-this look is soooooo prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for new interpretations , frankly . Over here- on some level this has always been the look in an older home . None of that wall-to-wall walnut cabinets like we are more used to in the States . I DO have to say , NOT having big old heavy cabinets on walls is soooooo REFRESHING ! a combo of both is nice- mixes the textural appearance of the wall and provides visual variation . Keep the open shelving AWAY from places that might get grease accumulation- and its not nearly as difficult or challenging as you might think ! <p> Love the look of open shelving but what if a fly slips in the door as you are going out the door . A single fly drives me up the wall and I 'll lurk for as long as it takes flyswatter in hand until I nail it . 23102 @qwx883102

We have a small collection of faux fur blankets to drape over the beds or sofas for chilly nights . I do love my Mongolian lambswool pillow cover , and recently I succumbed to the lure of the sheepskin rug . <p> I originally bought it for the floor but it has made its way to the tufted sofa . This is the spot the kitty prefers now but I love just as much for catching up on magazines or a great read . Ubiquitous ? Sure . But I could n't care less given how soft it is. <h> 45 comments <p> Hey , I was reading through the post , recognizing a photo , and noticing you have the image credit incorrectly identified .

I 've used it over a large leather ottoman to soften the brown in the room . For the holidays , I draped my white coffee table trunk for a winter scene . I topped it with a cloche filled with bulbs and its fantastic ( on the eyes and the feet ) . I absolutely see myself adding a few more in other rooms ! <p> I just told my husband today that I want to get a couple to dress up ( rather , camoflage ) our sofa . The slipcover is very warn . We cant replace the sofa or come up with a new slipcover for a couple of months , but I thought a couple of small sheepskins would work .

My daughters both slept on sheepskins ( not long ones but special baby ones with shorter pile ) from birth . Nothing beats the feel of natural fibers and nothing is more natural than wool . I love them in the bedroom and on a huge ottoman , preferably somewhere where you can snuggle up to it . <p> Been wanting one of these for a long time and you convinced me ! They sure do look so cuddly and warm and if I were a gambling person I bet its just what our cat , Little Kitty will surely take over once its positioned on our bed . Oh well , they have style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading your blog . Your taste and style are exactly like mine . I 've gotten lots of inspiration from you . I was wondering if you could tell me where you got your tufted sofa ? I have been pondering a few different ones and thought it might help me make a decision . Thanks so much and Happy Holidays ! Donna <p> My Grandparents had a couple rugs they bought on a trip to New Zealand when I was a kid . The ABSOLUTE place to take a nap ! ! Many warm , snuggy hours spent on those rugs by all 12 grandchildren ! My Mom still has the sheepskin mattress pad they got also , makes her guest bed cozy ! ! Thanks for sparking great memories to start my day ! <p> I 've got two placed on either side of our master bed and they are GLORIOUS to squish your feet into when you get up in the morning .

I 've put a towel there to collect his continuous flow of fur but a sheep skin would look so much better . I think I might be joining the club very soon . <p> I got one from my MIL for Christmas about 15 years ago I used it in our bedroom for a few years , put it away , and pulled it back out 2 years ago .

@@99057940 @3257940/ <h> Make Your Own Colored Chalkboard Paint <p> By Kate Riley March 24 , 2011 <p> It was a dark and stormy night . Really , it was . Last weekend , I was home on a Saturday night in my pajamas , experimenting with some brands of colored chalkboard paint , making vases , and halfheartedly watching a movie . This is the suburban life I lead . <p> All of a sudden I had an idea . What if I did n't want to stick with the manufactured colored chalkboard paints I was working with ? What about a DIY version in any color I could possibly imagine ? I remembered that Martha Stewart had published a recipe years ago for homemade chalkboard paint , but I had never tried it . When I went to find it online I could n't . That dark and stormy night had killed my internet connection . I recalled it was some combination of non-sanded grout and paint , so I started experimenting , mixing up batches of my own , wondering if this would really work . <p> Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with it ! <p> OK , maybe it did . <p> At first , I came up with 2 tablespoons of grout to 3 tablespoons of paint a combo that was way too thick . So I kept at it , adding more paint each time , eventually ending up at a formula that was made up of 3/4 cup of latex paint and 2 tablespoons of non-sanded grout . <p> With the blue paint left over from my boy 's room , I created this little toothbrush holder , with my very own homemade chalkboard paint . Love it ! <p> By the end of the night , I discovered that Martha was correct . A combination of non-sanded grout and latex paint truly does create a working chalkboard surface in any color you wish . <p> So I made some spring planters too , in more custom colors I mixed myself . <p> Theyre great just in case you want to leave messages to amuse yourself . . . <p> . . . or welcoming ones too . <p> My final experiment was with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . I was able to make a wall mounted chalkboard in the kid 's playspace with the same exact wall color from this room . Awesome . <p> A few things I learned in my experiments . <p> 1 . Your concoction should look like runny oatmeal once mixed . Mmmm , tasty ! You will question your sanity and whether this will ever really work , as I did many times . <p> 2 . When you first apply your homemade chalkboard paint , there are a ton of granules that convince you this will indeed never work . <p> 3 . As you apply the paint to the surface , 95% of the granules dissolve leaving a mostly smooth surface . You 'll have to pick out a few of the larger remaining clumps , but for the most part , I was shocked how the grout seemed to melt ' into the paint . Cool . <p> 4 . Chalk ink pens are not friendly to your homemade concoction . <p> So unfriendly , it required that I repaint over the entire section with my homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader suggested the use of nail polish remover for chalk ink pens . <p> 5 . If you want to use chalk ink pens , stick with the manufactured colored chalkboard paints . Those surfaces will not discolor like the homemade version does when using the specialty chalk pens . <p> 6 . The good news is , traditional chalk works perfectly ! In fact , a simple damp rag allows you to erase any white chalk and start over with a clean chalkboard background . <p> 8 . Unlike the manufactured colors by Hudson and RustOleum , your surface will not be as smooth . The nice thing about the manufactured paint colors is they go on perfectly smooth like ordinary acrylic or latex paints . The homemade version , at least in my experience , required that I pick out some of the granules as I went along . Light sanding might help alleviate this problem with the first coat , but then you have the same issue with the second coat . I 'd still do recommend the homemade version for smaller projects . <p> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fancy chalkboard for themselves no matter what you say . <p> But at least I have my planters ! <p> Those outdoor pillows I found last year at OSH , I wish they still had them but I checked , they do n't . <p> How industrious , Kate ! That pic of your daughter is delish and I love the planters ; I cant believe anyone has that weather already . We have ice and snow and temps in the 20s today ! But that 's Michigan ! Got ta love it ! <p> This is such a timely post as just this morning I was experimenting with chalkboard paint . I cant tell you exaclty what I am doing as I am not sure it will work . If it does I will be sure to post about it ! <p> Are you kidding me ? Where do you come up with this fabulous stuff ? I imagine that you lay awake in bed at night thinking " what can I do next ? " Lol . I love your creativity and your drive . The planters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amaze me , Kate ! I have to ask about your " recipe " above for the green chalkboard paint " 1 part avoidance " ? Was the green chalkboard paint mocking you or giving you a hard time ? ; - ) <p> Love those planters- what a great idea ! Im impressed that you actually came up with the formula- I would have waited for my internet connection to come back ( or decided I did n't  really need chalkboard paint after all ) ! : D <p> I have often wondered how easy it would be to make my own . I have seen the recipe also .. but , let 's face it .. I am too lazy . : -0 I love the flower pots . I wonder how well they would handle the rain ? Anything outdoors here would be rained on , A LOT . <p> oh , and you 're right about the chalk pen not being **28;1364;TOOLONG thing . I tried using a white chalk pen on my wall recently and it DID NOT want to come off the wall . Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Magic Eraser . <p> I did n't  know you could make your own chalkboard paint either , before you mentioned it . I do n't  see why you would n't want to greet your guests with " Do you have Thin Mints ? " That 's a good thing to know before you invite people into your home . I need to pair drinking and crafting together more oftenmaybe if I loosened up a bit , I 'd be more fearless . ; ) <p> oh **41;1394;TOOLONG ! i doubt very much we can get chalkboard paint here ( already enquired from my favourite paint shop and he said nobody around our parts knows about or buys these things so he stopped stocking them ) . never imagined you could actually make it ! excited ! <p> OMG brilliant ! Those pots are gorgeous . I 'm definitely going to make some of those for Mothers Day and maybe even my garden clubs small plant sale we have each year ( we either donate the money to charity or use it to add plants to some of our community flower beds ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint we have . <p> I just took out the leftover grout that was used when we built our house , it was going out with the trash tomorrow ! Not anymore ! I was planning on making a chalkboard table this weekend for my boys ! Talk about PERFECT timing ! ! ! I 'm SO excited right now ! ! ! <p> You play around with crafty things the way I would play around in the kitchen . I 'm really brave at mixing up my own creations in the kitchenthis project of your would never have crossed my mind . Very cool idea ! <p> I wish I wouldve read this about 2 weeks ago ! I painted my door and then used some great new chalk markers all over it .. and then also had to repaint . I 'm glad you posted this though to save other people time and frustration ! <p> This is great ! And then after the Thin Mint notion , I decided that this is something I could do with my girl scouts ! ! ! ! I thought you were being clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were eating dill pickles , drinking wine and avoiding the project ! ! ! And OMG , is that a DISH I SPY in your kitchen sink ? ? ? How reckless of you . ; ) <p> Jackie B , you 've witnessed my kitchen less than clean ! ! ! Typical day actually . And I 'm sure many peeps thought the same as you about the dill pickles and avoidance but they are the names of my paint colors ! ! ! ! <p> Jackie the non sanded grout is actually a very fine powder so I do n't  think a blender would do any good , great thinking though ! <p> I can not tell you how excited I am to find your terrific " recipe " and can not wait to try in on my potting shed inside-of-exterior-door ! Ill be able to keep all my seed info attractively . There were great colors available originally but now I can only find black or green . Bravo to you ! Love those pots . Oh boy , Spring is just around the corner ! Thank You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this I was inspired to paint one entire wall in my office with chalkboard paint so I can go crazy with the ideas as they come to me , but was frustrated with the color selection at my local Home Depot . Then you went and posted this . I hear you ! ( I just hope i have the skills to pull this off ! ) Stay tuned ! I plan to post about my success ( or failure ) and share it with you ! Gracias ! ! <p> Hey Katie , have you considered magnetic primer ? I know your board is already magnetic , but to use latex chalkboard paint over it , you 'll have to prime it first . Try the magnetic primer ( 2 coats ) then the chalkboard paint . I would love to hear how it turns out ! ! ! Great to think of having both ! <p> So happy you posted this . I am planning on painting a large section behind my sons bed on his wall and have been unhappy with the existing tint colors . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe . If I can become more computer/picture savvy I 'll send some before and after ! <p> Great idea to make the paint ! ! But also did you know that Home Depot or the local paint store can tint the white chalkboard paint ANY color you like ? You can pick any color from a color sample or match it to a pillow . That way you can tint it to match some other paint you have exactly ! <p> I did NOT know that I could make my own chalkboard paint ! But I have unsanded grout and have a strange obsession with mixing paint colors . All the stars are aligning hereif I do it , I 'll link to your blog . Thanks ! <p> Although I much rather just buy the paint instead of make it , I like that you can produced any color you want instead of the typical black and I especially love the red wine on the counter ! : ) What kind ? ? <p> Hey Carol ! Great question I do n't  know if you need to use white ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used pure white , so let me know if you experiment , I 'm so interested to find out if different grout powder effects the color of the paint and final result ! Kate <p> Awesome Celeste , so good to know ! ! Now that I think of it , the RustOleum versions come in quarts , so it makes perfect sense you can choose any color and tint it there in the paint department , you smart girl ! Kate <p> I love your colors and am crazy about chalkboard paint too ! Ive been making my own with satin latex . I love the idea from an earlier comment about having Home Depot mix colors of any shade into the white chalkboard paint . Brilliant ! As for the clumps , I never had a problem when I first started making my paint but I wonder if over time some moisture got into the huge bag of grout ? It was n't sealed very tight . Could that make it more clumpy ? Thank you so much for sharing ! <p> Hi , I tried this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickle jar sized batch and coming back to it after about a week , I found that it had turned into almost a solid . Did you have this experience in trying to store it ? Or did you try to store it at all ? I know my jar was sealed properly . Any advice would be appreciated ! Thanks for the post . <p> Kate I was looking for chalkboard paint to match my kitchen and I stumbled on to your page . I love DIY projects , so when I saw this , I was so excited to try it . It was so easy to make and a 1/2 quart was big enough to do my 30+36 ? sized board . I even made a little bag to hold the chalk . lol <p> I started with magnetic primer and added a total of 4 coats of your paint . It worked out so well and everyone loves it ! I am attaching a photo to show you . Please mind the mess , we are still in the process of moving in . : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am now even more proud of my kitchen : ) <p> Oh wow . these ideas are great and fabulous ! All of these pics are so inspiring , and the great things you can do with chalkboard paint is endless . I found //www.hudsonpaint.com and bought my daughter 2 quarts of genius pink genius , a great , girly , hot pink . She absolutely loves it , and it is now covering an entire wall of her room . Her and her friends do the greatest and funniest things with chalk , and we are both really happy we did it ! <p> cant wait to try this with my cub scouts i 'm going to get sample jars of paint and let them mix there own ck board paint maybe prime some sheetmetal and let them make their own magnetic chalk board for home what fun <p> Hi , I just recently came across your website after having the idea of trying out the chalkboard paint . I excitedly went to work and whipped up my own batch of white chalkboard paint and painted my pantry door white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few little flower pots white ( I really like white ) . Then I waited patiently for the paint to dry and went to work marking up my new chalkboards with chalk ( I used traditional chalk in blue ) and then when I went to wipe it off , and found that it left a faint shadow of blue of what I had written . <p> Is this normal for using colored chalk ? Is using white as the paint color not recommended ? I would like to know if others ran into this same problem or if I may have done something wrong . I would really like to use white if I 'm able , but if others have found it to be impossible to work with , I would like to know as well . <p> I work for a non-profit and we are always trying to find inexpensive ways to create art/crafts . Love the chalk board paint receipe- we experiment a lot too ! If your into recycling/reuse , you can use the chalkboard paint on the insert panel of an old cabinet door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hooks and you have a key rack and message center ! You have also saved a cabinet door from the landfill ! ! ! <p> Even grout that does n't  have sand often has other additives , like polymers that can be less than desirable for chalkboards . Because it is getting more and more difficult to find grout that does n't  have any additives , I offer these two options : Powdered sheet rock compound . Drawback is in the quantity you must buy , just to get a few tablespoons , Best readily available item I found is to use plaster of paris . Can get it in small quantities , and often already in the toolkit of many crafters . <p> Or , how about this one ? Pulverize a piece of sidewalk chalk to a fine dust . ( Use a common grater , or heavy sandpaper . ) Its calcium carbonate , AKA " chalk " . That 's the part of the grout useful to you , and that 's the easiest , least expensive option . <p> I just did this to our coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls ; I used a metal whisk to stir and had ZERO clumping issues . At first , I mixed the paint in a metal mixing bowl , which was ideal as there were no corners to scrape at , but on subsequent batches I just mixed directly in the paint traya little more work to get the grout out of the corners , but the whisk worked like a dream , no clumps , no lumps , NOTHING ! <p> All great instructions but I have just a few suggestions : Sand your raw surface first with 220 paper . Wipe off . Prime with Oil Based primer that is tinted gray . Sand again with 220 . Wipe off . Use cottage cheese containers that you have marked the 1 cup line on . Put a little water int he bottom , add the 2 tbsp grout , mix to a fine paste , THEN add your paint to the 1 cup line . This will give you a smooth , non-sandy paint . <p> So Ive tried to do the same thing and it did n't  work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor black mat paint and the mixture is no time became thick like tar . I tried to spread it on the plywood anyway but it seems more like pavement than paint . What did I do wrong ? <p> I tried again .. this time I made the chalk board paint 1 cup at a time . Once the grout was mixed in I quickly dumped it onto my plywood and rolled it out . I noticed it was a tiny bit lumpy so I did a final coat and this time mixed the grout with a little water before mixing it in my paint . This last coat worked the best and my huge outdoor 3x4 ' chalk boards were a success ! 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057950 @3257950/ <h> Master Bedroom Update <p> By Kate Riley August 22 , 2011 <p> Hey all , hope you had a great weekend ! We did a lot of lounging around , but I also took the time to snap a few photos of some of the changes I 've made to our master bedroom over the last few months . How about a quick tour ? <p> Me and my mister have gone around and around in our master bedroom , him always representing in the left corner Mr. Traditional Lover of Dark Wood Antiques with me in the right corner as Mrs. Classic White Meets Touches of Modern . The tricky part has always been how do we find a happy compromise ? The agreement finally came to this : If he gets to keep the dark wood antique dressers he 's so fond of , I get to pick the paint colors , fabrics and accessories . Deal ! <p> We both agree on one thing , we prefer soothing colors in our master . It 's a place to withdraw from the world , catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to keep it in the neutral zone , but then play around with patterns . This year , I added a little bit of graphic , a touch of zebra , and a hint of Ikat in the sophisticated blue grays , taupes , and champagne tones I find so appealing . <p> Yes , you can see , I did paint over the trellis wall ! Long story short , I wanted something less olive , much lighter and more gray , plus this Devon mirrorand the linens were competing , so we said goodbye to the stenciled trellis wall and replaced it with the focal point mirror over the bed ! You like ? <p> Across from the bed is the antique Drexel Heritage dresser the mister is so fond of . That beautiful print in the middle is by Richard Franklin we bought over over a decade ago , it 's called To Go Beyond ' . He proposed in Italy in front of Michaelangelo 's David ' so call us sentimental , but it reminds us of that amazing sculpture in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers from our yard used to hang in my office a long time ago , but now balance the Franklin print . <p> That 's me in my wedding dress , much much younger ! I still love that classic shot so I keep it on display . <p> This bronze chandy is from Home Depot we found it five years ago , I have no idea if they still carry it . I 'd like to replace it someday with something really modern and completely amazing , but for now , the simplicity and Old World vibe work fine . <p> On his side of the room is the other dresser he loves and also his closet ( to the right ) . <p> I found this blanched driftwood bowl and hung it on the wall instead to create some textural and sculptural art it 's a nice contrast with the traditional dresser . On top is the sweetheart tray I made from sheet music earlier this year . <p> His side is the room has his nightstand , complete with reading material and an ampersand I spotted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven shade blinds they are Levolor cut to fit at Lowes and much less expensive than custom . <p> On my side is the Draper knockoff dresser I found at a thrift store two years ago . I 've repainted it twice , and now it 's my nightstand where I keep all my books , my journal , and a notebook for when creativity strikes . The pair of gourd lamps are from Marshalls , I spray painted them gloss white last year . <p> Tray from West Elm , bowl from Anthropologie . <p> The fabulous gray Kenya accent pillows are from Z Gallerie . I 've never bought anything in zebra print in my entire life , but these two called my name very loudly when I spied them in the store . <p> Graphic floral bedding is the classic Poetical ' by Barbara Barry , which I scored on sale at Bed , Bath &amp; Beyond . <p> I do miss my trellis wall , but I love these new fabrics even more ! Some of you may be wondering , what the heck is that paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one specific color , but in fact , it 's two blended together : -+ Ben Moore Camouflage ' and -+ Ben Moore Misted Green ' ( which I originally tried on the wall , but it did n't look quite right ) . I blended my leftover Camouflage ' with the Misted Green ' for the perfect grayish bluish greenish ( depending on the light ) wall color and I 've promised my hub I wo n't be painting in here ever again ! I know better than to commit like that . . but this month time I really mean it ! <p> Love , love , LOVE your bedroom ! I especially like how you combined the dark and light furniture . It is rare you see this combination and it truly works . : ) My eyes were drawn to the mismatched side tables . This is another thing that is n't too often seen but works beautifully . <p> As for compromise with me and my hubby , we do n't  . I 'm lucky in that regard . It could be that my taste is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our room was done in pinks and ruffles , he then might have an opinion . Lol . <p> We are moving this Saturday into the historic district of town . Our home was built in 1847 and has a bit of work to be done on it . My blog is new with not much on it at all , but as soon as the projects begin I 'm certain I 'll have a lot to post . <p> Thanks for sharing . I love your blog , your talent , and the inspiration you give me . : ) <p> Your master bedroom is beautiful ! My husband and I do n't  have to compromise too much because my style is n't overly feminine . Every once in awhile he informs me he thinks the house has too many flowers , but that 's only when his buddies are about to come over . : ) <p> Love the combination of the dark woods against the beautiful wall color ! This is such a soothing and glamorous room . Youve done a phenomenal job ! What I like about the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every single decorating blog they all seem to have the exact same furnishings . Its good to see something different for a change . <p> Your master bedroom is truly amazing ! I love how you mixed the old and new together . The wall color makes the room so relaxing , and the fabrics and accents really pull the room together . Its fabulous ! <p> I think you did a wonderful job of blending your styles ! We have very large , heavy , dark wood furniture in our bedroom . And while it is excellent quality , its not what I would choose today if I had the option . But the hubby loves it . I really like the compromise you all came tooseems fair to me ! And I like the hints of zebra . I like zebra print in small doses . I bought a pair of zebra print flats with hot pink trim a few years ago , and they are my favorite shoes . : ) <p> Could you please share the shade of grey that is painted on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are so many shades of white as wellwhat color did you choose ? We are thinking about putting up crown moulding in the bedrooms and I am shocked by all the shade of " white " ! I also love the mix of light at dark furniture . <p> Wow ! This is so pretty = ) I love that wedding pic of you , and the wall of framed art . We are slowly trying to merge styles in our Master Bedroom ( and entire house ) alsoits hard sometimes ! You have done a great job here = ) <p> Ohhhhhh my , that does n't  look like a compromise to me at all ! ! Its beautiful ! I absolutely love the warmth that the antique wood brings to the otherwise cool palate . Those are my dream dressersif you ever convince hubs to give them up please let me know : ) . <p> This is beautiful and very soothing . I loooove his dressers ! It could be worse . My husband refuses to give up his childhood dressers which are from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! *sniffle* My husband and I do n't  decorate together . The main rule is nothing overly feminine . Other than that , its my choice ! : ) <p> Beautiful ! I have been wanting to paint my bedroom gray . I have black distressed furniture and white bedding . Thinking about a dropcloth bedskirt and white curtains . Would a white or deeper gray piece look off ? Also would like some bamboo blinds . I have the lighter ones in my living room from Overstock . Thinking about a french blue as accent color . Ack ! Help ! <p> Lovely Kate ! Youve done a gorgeous job . The zebra pillows are great . Ive been toying with bringing one from our basement into our bedroom . Its black and white though . The gray and white would look much better . But after seeing yours , I may have to give it a try . : ) <p> I love the finished room ! I have a question about the Devon mirror . In your pictures , it appears more silver but on Z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing a quick note about which of the shades it leans toward ( silver or gold ) . Thank you so much ! <p> Hey Jennifer , its definitely a champagne color , in between silver and gold . The color on the website is more golden than in real life ! And for the other Jenifer , all of the white trim in our house is Swiss Coffee ! Kate <p> Just beautiful ! You 're compromise turned out wonderful . The dark dressers look great with the rest of the room . Our house is a jumbled up mess of decorating and projects that need to be completed . We compromise by price and my husbands comfort . As long as he has a comfortable chair and TV , he is pretty much set . I am not too fond of his chair , but I let it go . <p> LOVE this ! So pretty , calm , clean and peaceful . It makes me want to lie down and take a nap . How did you anchor that mirror above the bed ? I 'm scared of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I live in So . Cal , earthquake city . <p> This is beautiful ! Love the neutral colors , the elegant patterns , the textures . Love the paint color , the mirror , the blanket at the foot of the bed , the &amp; , the chandelier . I seriously love it . Great mix of traditional with contemporary . Way to be a classy " grown up " lol <p> Oh man , I 'm so jealous ! I find myself in the same scenario as you are but I have been much less successful in pulling it all together . My husband likes everything darkdark wood , dark walls , dark EVERYTHING ! I 'm so sick to death of brown right now I cant stand it . I 've recently redecorated my room and I pulled in this beautiful shade of blue but I cant seem to get it the way I want it because there is still so much brown in the room . All of our furniture is a dark stained wood . Our floorswhich I love by the way , are a very dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade ofyou guessed itbrown ! I think I may show him this post and see what he thinks . I think if he would just let me paint over the walls in a soft subtle blue I would be happy with all the rest of the dark wood . I really love your room . It is perfect ! <p> Ha Sally , good eye ! I keep our *hideous from the early 90s black with bright red digital numbers* alarm clock out of the pics , but it sits on my hubs side next to that ampersand . Perhaps I should " keep it real " but seriously , its so ugly and uninspiring I could n't take looking at it in the pictures so it was edited out at the last minute ! ! ! xo Kate <p> Thankfully , my man let 's me do whatever I want . He rolls his eyes on occasion when I mention I want to do somethingbut he let 's me do it ! I have tried to pull some sort of suggestion from him when I 'm decorating . And we 've gone to decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can guess his style if I let him choose . He usually gravitates towards the old worldrelaxeddarker colors . And he tends to like big chunky furniturebut then , what man does n't  ? LOL <p> I love your soothing bedroom*sigh*wish mine were like that . I have teals , yellows , and browns . But they are very relaxing to usand as long as I keep the comforter thin but warmthe man is happy . <p> Hi ! I 'm new to this blog and am just amazed at your talent and creativity ! You are a real inspiration ! Its a gorgeous roomIm curious about the blanched driftwood bowl . I googled it and could n't find anything do you know where it came from ? Thanks ! <p> Looks AMAZING ! ! I happen to LOVE the natural wood mixed in with the neutral furniture , bedding &amp; accessories . You did good ! ! I 'm loving your mirror above the bed ! Any chance you could share where you found it ? <p> So lovely I love the dark dresser and chest mixed with your more modern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband does n't  really care much about furniture , paint or anything so no blending really- I get to have it my way with the decor and style ! hehehe ! I love your colors in your room too I am debating painting my French Cottage inspired bedroom- which is right now pale yellow . Your room is very serene and calm in the gray- love it . <p> My hubby let 's me do whatever I want when it comes to decorating our bedroom . I always try to keep his taste in mind . Modern . When I painted my bedroom a pale pinkish lavender , I decided I needed to " man it up " a bit . so I accessorized with black . Painted 2 different bedside tables black lacquer . Put glass knob on mine . Black and white pillows and lots of reflective surfaces . He loves it . <p> I love it ! It is very soothing and I do like seeing the mix of light and dark . My husband pretty much let 's me decide things around the house , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do it if I threw a fit , but I almost agree with him . While I love the painted lookI cant bring myself to paint the darker wood furniture . So , we mix it up and live with what we love ( or what we have ) ! <p> " Blending " styles with my husband is actually more about waiting . I have to give him a LOT of time to get used to an idea . So , first I casually mention something I 've been considering . Later , I may show him a photo of something similar on a blog or in a magazine . Then , much later , I 'll mention the idea again , showing him how economically it can be done compared to a designer version . Lots of time , lots of talking . <p> : ) <p> Unfortunately , I do n't  think he s EVER going to come around on painting the piano turquoise like I saw on Pinterest ! <p> Kate , Your room is gorgeous ! I love the way you kept the dark furniture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your style . Your master definitely looks like a place to relax . Love it ! Ca n't wait to decorate our new master bedroom , but I have a few months to wait . : ( Love ya ! <p> What a beautiful room . Love the bedding fabrics ! Those dressers are gorgeous and they do add a lot of rich depth to your room . All my hubby cares about is if the furniture placement allows the best view of the tv . : ( <p> I am just amazed at your design and decorating talent . Your room is just gorgeous ! I love the wall color and love that you incorporated the dark wood pieces . It gives me inspiration for what my master could look like . And your wedding photo is so pretty . Thank you for sharing it ! ! <p> We have the exact same " argument " about our bedroom . We only had a bed frame and hand me down dressers until 4 years ago when my daughter was born . We put the white painted dressers in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I wanted a wood high boy and dresser/mirror combo but also wanted mis-matched nightstands and a fabric headboard . The hubs did not agree . He wanted to get a whole bedroom set . We finally compromised ( ok , I finally caved ) and settled on matching dressers and headboard as long as I could choose different nightstands . But when we found something we liked it ended up costing only $50 more to get 2 matching nightstands as part of the set ! ! ! I knew how practical that was and so now we have an entire room ( 5 pieces ) of matching furniture . I know its a big decorating no-no but they are super practical storage and he s happy with it . Its actually given me a little more freedom in the rest of the house because I can remind him " well , we did get the matching bedroom stuff YOU wanted . " And , someday I 'll switch it up . Probably when he s out of town . : - ) <p> Hahaha my husband and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has blown up and framed of his beloved black lab so I need to take that into consideration for any decorating . That and he s got a really nice wooden chest from his mom and some driftwood art that his mom had made that also need to be in the room . <p> I LOVE the colors ! I 'm thinking of doing our master in shades of grey with accents in black , silver and mirror but I 'm not sure how it will work so I need to do some internet searching for what I 'm looking for : ) <p> I have a question . I have exact same devon mirror and I was wondering if you can tell me how you hung your mirror securely . This mirror is soooo heavy and I do n't  know how to hang such a heavy mirror ! : ( <p> I am glad the mister won out on the dressersthey are too pretty to paint such traditional Sheraton styled pieces and they lend warmth to what would be a very " cold " room if they were painted white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall color and new look . Beautiful space . <p> Perfect timing ! I have a beautiful cherry sleigh bed and tall dresser , but wanted to make the whole room lighter and more modern , and just could n't figure out how to do it . This is excellent , it is kick-starting my thinking ! As for alarm clocks , I envision an old style would fit in beautifully manual with bells on top . <p> I have been looking for the perfect gray &amp; you 've found it ! My luck is that it does n't  come straight from the can ! Perhaps I can give your blend a try it is the perfect shade ! P.S. I love hubbys fav . furniture pieces ! ! ! The warm wood tones blended with your style give an eclectic look that is very put together . <p> Gorgeous ! I was out yesterday and saw this fabric in person . I immediately thought of your room . The flowers in person are a lighter blue than they appear here . And the coordinating fabrics are beautiful too : <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another one of your rooms that Ive fallen in love with . Nice blend of the masculine and feminine sides ; very relaxing . Who would n't want to come home to this . <p> I totally agree with Monique ! As my grandma would say ( and did about my master bedroom ) , " What an utterly delightful , welcoming room ! " I do n't  know what it is with husbands and dark , traditional furniture . Mine is the same way . I pretty much do the same thing you do , I work around them . Add flowers and pretty colors and it ( usually ) all works out . <p> I do n't  compromise with him much . i am a designer , and he would have his place look like the set of star trek if left alone . I ask his advise on things like pick between these two paint colours I have pre selected and what do you think of this light fixture etc but with the full understanding his suggestions are taken under advisement not as law . Luckily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out place is n't really girly . However YOUR husband has GREAT taste in furniture . That dresser is gorgeous and I envy you . really pops in the room and gives it some needed grounding while still having feminine lines that play off the rest of the room . Also . I really love that chandelier . its kinda small but very pretty . <p> Beautifullydone and you really scored some great bargains ! And , oh , btw , I DO NT compromise with my husband .. he is so wonderfully uninterested and only tells me what he does n't  like and that 's how we handle it . Getting compliments on our home all the time I think gives him confidence ! <p> Peaceful , serene with a zing of personality . I love your space . Our MB is very similar in colour-scheme and I love it . I always add a pop of red somewhere in my rooms and in our MB , you can find it woven into a cozy throw and also accent pillows . May you have many restful and stress-free nights in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain as well ! Lovely ! <p> Compromise ? Well , its just that . I 'm on a grey and yellow kick , but he does n't  like yellow . I could force the issue and he would settle , but if he really dislikes it , I do n't  feel right about it . I AM going to paint our bedroom grey , and your grey looks just about right . Not too much blue , not too much green . <p> Ha ! I had to laugh at your question because my mister does n't  like ANYTHING . I mean , hed totally be all for beige walls in every room , and nothing on the walls . We just built a new home and are butting heads over EVERYTHING . We went form a 2-bedroom to a 4-bedrrom , and do n't  have stuff to fill it yet , so every purchase is a struggle , especially since we need so much on a budget . Well get thru it eventually , right ? <p> BTW , your room is just gorgeous ! ! ! I especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would n't by chance be making a trip to Ohio anytime soon would you ? : D <p> I have the same beloved Richard Franklin print with the same frame even ( and I am from Belgium ) , but instead of behind glass it has been treated with some kind of glaze so it is both protrected and you can see the brush strokes , making it seem pretty much like a real painting : - ) <p> What a stunner ! So many pretty details in every shot . My favorites : zebra pillows ( ALWAYS a winner ! ) , draper nightstands and the warmth from the wood pieces your mister likes . Now to be a total &amp; complete suck-up.I have a bad case of photography-skills-envy . Your pictures are so pretty ! <p> Hi ! First time here and talk about a great introduction and seeing something that wows me ! Your bedroom is GORGEOUS ! Love everything about it , great job ! I love love love the colors .. what color paint did you use ? That is a perfect gray if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I am your newest follower . Please stop by me too to say hi if you get a minute . Beautiful job here ! <p> I love your bedroom ! I 'm going to go out and blog-copy . Hope you do n't  mind ? I 'm in LOVE with gray and white and while I have the white going on , I have n't the gray . We live in a rented 70s house ( just for another year ) inside has n't  moved into the current century as well , but am now tired of waiting to make it look like something . My beautiful grays and whites might not go with the wooden louvered cupboard doors , or the beige vertical blinds , but at least I 'll be in bed heaven . <p> I absolutely love the way the traditional wood dressers ground the space . They play well with the bronze chandelier and baskets and blinds as well . If you had a modern chandelier the whole room would take off in a too-etherial way . in my opinion , and maybe look to " trendy-modern " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE the zebra . I have a little zebra ( or animal print ) in almost every one of my rooms always subtle though . I used to have some beige and ivory zebra pillows . They were my fav . Oddly enough , the greys , whites , browns , and more blacks are in my room with some punches of yellow and magenta . Grey is the best ! Where did you get the throw and the other pillows on your bed ? I 'm loving the pattern . <p> I was TOTALLY going to ask about the wall color ! Love the bedroom , love the zebra pillows ! In the middle of a master bedroom redo ourselves and going with a really neutral black , white and tons of grey scheme ! ! Thanks for making me insanely jealous : ) <p> I think you did such a beautiful job of mixing your design styles and have to agree with so many other viewers that the wood both warms and grounds the lighter , prettier elements in the room . So kudos to both your husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very back , very soon , if it is n't already . But you know this . ( I love that you did n't  paint your wood cabinets in the dining room ! ) Camille <p> at first i thought , well , let 's just divide the rooms . you can decorate some rooms in the house , and ill decorate the others . then i realized that the house would look horribly mismatched and uneven . <p> so , we 've lived in our house for nearly a year and have made no progress in decorating . lol. i started a blog ( linked ) and i 'm hoping to get the ball rolling . were starting to see eye to eye , at least somewhat . <p> Your room is gorgeous . Looks like a perfect retreat . So many great things , but my favorite is your wedding dress picture . Its beautiful and perfect for the master bedroom . I think its awesome that you have it on display . Thank you so much for sharing , its very inspirational ! <p> Lovely room . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paint colour we 've just painted ( second time in 3months ) but I wish I 'd seen this before committing to my second colour I feel another painting marathon coming on <p> I am in love ! I like to comprimised with my boyfriend because I want him to love the space he lives in too . He could care less though and would let me paint the walls pink if it made me happy . We have been stalling on decorating our bedroom in our apartment because I just could n't decide on what to do . When I showed the BF the pictures of your bedroom , he said " I love it " when normally he would just say , " that 's nice " . Thank you for the inspiration ! ! ! <p> Hi there ! I have the same starburst mirror , but mine is much more gold than yours appears in the photo above . Yours looks more silver . Is it just the lighting of the pic , or did you somehow change the color ? Just wondering because I 've been thinking of repainting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you post a tutorial ? Thanks ! <p> I love this and am in the process of copying aspects of your room . I am going to get the Barbara bary duvet , but do you think this will Work with white linen drapes and white sheets , it seems to be more of a cream color in the store ? Also- do you have a comforter inside your duvet ? It looks flat ? I just started following you and love everything you write ! <p> Kate , your bedroom is gorgeous and inspiring ! ! ! I really love your style and how much thought you put into each room . But the curtains just look off , and I could n't move on without commenting . Ive been doing a look of research as Im about to hang them in several rooms in my house . What Ive learned is that with just a couple of changes you can make store-bought curtains look elegant and expensive . You need to get thicker rods , mount them just below the crown molding and further outside your windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and use rings or clips to hang the panels from the rod . I think this will make a big impact . <p> Hi ! ! Love , love , love the room . I have just convinced myself a few weeks ago to paint my room gray , but have been searching for the perfect shade . : ) Will you clarify what you mixed again ? Was it half camouflage and half misted greenOr just half on the misted green only ? Thank you ! ! <p> Hi Imelda , I found it somewhere online , I want to say Home Decorators ? I needed something skinny to fit in that space that would n't block his closet door so i found that bookshelf and it works perfectly . Kate <p> So , you have inspired my first bedroom that I will ever share with my to-be husband : ) Actually , I am seriously recreating your bedroom . same bedspread , same wall color , and same blue accent color . lol thanks for being such an inspiration . i was really struggling with how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the comforter still available , , , , i am single and i find this room soo peaceful , , , , please help with the way to start this look.i am trying for the paint color , , , , then the bedding pillows etc .. love it , , , i want to love my peaceful spot ! for ME <p> I just registered for the same duvet cover and shams earlier today , and knew it was the right choice when I saw your pictures . Your room looks awesome ! I 've always wanted to go with gray walls , but I have a question . When I saw the " Poetical " set online it said silver , but in the store it looked more of ivory/tan colors . Do you find that the gray walls , bring out the silver in the duvet cover ? Thank you ! <p> Your designs are beautiful ! Can you tell me is the Barbara Barry Poetical duvet gray or taupe ? I am looking for something gray and just love this print . In some pictures I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown/taupe . <p> I found an image of your room on Pinterest and had to come check it out . Ive been to your blog before but somehow its been awhile . LOVE the pillows and mix of grayish colors . I 'm slowly evolving my bedroom into a spot I really love , not just a place to sleep at night . Some day I hope to have some great pieces like you do ! But its definitely a work in progress ! ! ! <p> And now for the practical question is the duvet purely for looks or do you guys use it or does it get kicked off every night ? We are making the switch to a quilt with a duvet at the foot of the bed ( or the other way around ) and the hubs is n't convinced ! ! <p> LOVE ! I have been eyeing this bedding for SOOO long and did a " poetical " search on pinterest and found you , which is strange bc I 've been following you for so long and somehow missed this bedding post ! <p> Hi Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll coverlet is a Cal King . We use the duvet with down insert only on cold nights , then fold it up in the morning *if and when we make the bed* ! Kate <p> Hi . Ive been looking at the Devon Mirror at Z Gallerie forever now and keep debating because it looks more gold than silver on Z Galleries website . I noticed yours looks very silver in these photos . Did you paint yours or is this the " real " color ? I 'm actually hoping it is because I 'd prefer the mirror to be more silver than gold with my bedrooms color scheme . <p> Love , Love Love what you did here . Very nice use of color &amp; it looks very elegant . I love the use of the artwork &amp; how you hung the bowl ( art ) piece off center to allow the candlesticks the symmetry . I just painted the walls in our master bedroom in our beach house a similar color &amp; also have the dark dresser ( which I love ) to contend with . Originally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well with the tropical idea I had going . But once I put the gray blue paint color on the wall ( which I love ) I realized I was going to have to soften the darker pieces by adding in the creams &amp; whites to balance everything out : very much like you did . Im found your blog because I had googled bedrooms with this mix of colors . Just wanted to say you did a really lovely job ! ! <p> Kate , I LOVE this bedroom color . I tried to get it matched using the 1/2 &amp; 1/2 method ( but went to another store not Benjamin Moore ) and it turned into a minty green color : ( I did find a Behr color that was almost as nice , Gentle Rain , but I REALLY wish you could get a deal with BM to create this color . It is GORGEOUS ! Great job with your bedroom . It is absolutely stunning and so inspiring ! I hope my Master bedroom turns out half this amazing . Love your blog ! Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sunburst mirror from z gallerie or horchow ? I love the color of the frame in the pix and want to get it exactly right ! Its the most beautiful bedroom Ive ever seen ! ! ! ! You r amazing ! <p> Hi ! I was wondering if you could tell me where you got your bed . Ive been looking for a bed frame for our new master bedroom for over a year and I think I might just have found one that I like . Thanks ! <p> Hi Lori , that color is a blend of two Ben Moore Colors , more of a gray green in daylight . Its a mix of 1/2 Camouflage and 1/2 Misted Green , the closest color match is Comfort Gray ' by Sherwin Williams . <p> I know you have answered the question about your wall color a million times.what I would like to know is , does it give off a green hue or just the beautiful gray we are seeing in your pictures ? Somehow or another you seem to have created the right mix and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT JOB your bedroom looks fantastic ! ! One quick question if you do n't  mind ( I read most of the previous questions , but did n't  see this one already ) . where did you find your bamboo shades ? I 've had the HARDEST time finding the right color / look ! ! Thanks in advance ! ! ! : ) <p> I love your room ! ! Its stunning . I bought the same duvet cover from BBB and have a few questions for you , if you do n't  mind . What color/style bed skirt do you have ? And do you know what type of comforter you have inside the Barbara Barry duvet ? Im impressed with how nicely it folds at the end of your bed . When I put mine inside the duvet and fold it at the end of the bed , it is too fluffy . Is the color on the duvet a cream/ivory color and your are your sheets and blanket white ? I think it looks great in your pictures . The contrast between the duvet and white sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your answers ! <p> Hi Anna , our comforter is white and the BB duvet is cream/taupe . I like the contrast though . I used a very light comforter for the decorative BB Poetical duvet so its not too fluffy . The bed skirt is a pale gold ruffle . Kate <p> I absolutely love this bedroom ! I went to Z gallarrie the other day and the pillows are 50% off ! ! The only problem was the pillows had this yellowish tint in some spots ? NYSE lady who worked there said that they were sopossed to look like that but to me they looked stained . I was just wondering if your pillows had that same thing ? <p> Beautiful room ! How do I compromise with DH ? I do n't  . He s gone 5-6 days a week , so I get to do what I want with the house . LOL Seriously , as long as it is n't pink or floral , he does n't  care . This year I 'm on a " burnt red/tan/sage " kick . <p> Kate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new black and white chevron duvet from the Nate Berkus line for Target . I want to add pops of color so that things do n't  look so drab , but I do n't  know what prints to match w/ the comforter . Any guidance you can give up is greatly appreciated because I 'm so lostThanks ! <p> Hi , Kate I came across this post when searching for a picture of the Poetical bedding . We are building a house , and I am beginning to pull all the rooms decor together . I picked out this bedding a few weeks ago , our wall color will be close to your gray , our headboard is upholstered with nail-heads , I love lighter colors , and we have a special place in our hearts for Italy after vacationing there a few years ago . All this to say thank you for providing a template for decorating our new master ! I cant wait to read more from you . <p> Hi Kate , I love this bedroom ! I 'm trying to mimic this look in our new master bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a design dilemma . I feel that there is not enough grey in the duvet and against the grey walls it just looks off . From your pictures is looks as thought the duvet is grey and cream but once I got it , it looks more tan and cream . Does the tan duvet with the grey walls work in terms of design ? ? Or am I trying to be too matchy matchy with looking for grey bedding and grey walls ? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated ! ! <p> Hi Kristen , do n't  worry about being too matchy matchy , layers of neutral color are best ! My walls have a greenish bluish gray tine to them and yes the Poetical bedding is a taupe gray not a true gray . Tan , gray , taupe , they all work together as long as the undertones ( yellows , pinks ) do n't  compete ! Kate <p> Thanks so much for you advice ! ! I put the whole room together over the weekend and I LOVE it ! ! The poetical bedding looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve given me some great ideas ! ! Kristen <p> Hi Kate ! I read your post about the headboard DIY project and am wondering how far from the floor your headboard is hung ? If I wanted to make one for my king bed , how would you go about placing the fabric ? Think it would look funky if there was a seam at the bottom ? Found this site via Pinterest Fabulous ! ! ! ! <p> I know this is an old post , but it cracked me up ! I inherited the same furniture and serendipitously I just happened to paint my bedroom the same color as you did , unfortunately the similarities end there . I was trawling the internet hoping to find ideas to complete the effect and it was quite a shock to come across your room , you managed to rock it . Hopefully , by borrowing some of your stylish choices I can rock mine , too ! 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057951 @3257951/ <h> Rugs in the Casa <p> By Kate Riley August 31 , 2012 <p> I 've had a lot of questions lately about the rugs in our house so today I thought I 'd share a little more about them and some of my favorite sources for rugs . We have hardwood floors downstairs so I have rugs in all of the spaces , and a couple upstairs on the carpets too , just to add color and pattern . I do n't want to spend a fortune on a rug because I do n't want to freak if something spills on it like wine or chocolate or kid crud , so I 'm always looking for affordable options . Maybe someday I 'll have a Madeline Weinrib or a Thomas Paul , but for now , I try to keep rug purchases under $400 , preferably less . <p> Area rugs always ground a space so I like to use them to set the style or palette for the room or sitting area . I prefer when the style of the rug coordinates with the style of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rug but you 're always free to mix it up ! For the living room , I went with a traditional style , it 's a rug I bought on clearance at World Market two years ago , it used to sit in the family room but it has now made itself at home in the living room . <p> I get a ton of emails about this rug , but unfortunately I ca n't find it anywhere , even on eBay , but here are some comparables ! <p> This is an older picture of our entry ( the desk is gone ) but it 's the only one I have at this angle . The entry has a 6 ' round carpet with a blue flourish , I picked it up at Target over three years ago , and it 's not available anymore but there are a few similar rugs linked below ! <p> I bought a great indoor/outdoor rug for the family room earlier this year from Overstock , another favorite source for rugs . Our is the brown ( actually mocha ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a great rug that takes a lot of abuse in our most used room , adds a nice geometric pattern , and it still looks as great as the day I unrolled it . And yes , I moved the console table out of the entry and into the family room , I 'm guilty of always moving stuff around ! <p> I love Dash &amp; Albert rugs they have the best stripes and palettes ! The cotton rugs are affordable , the wool versions are pricier but I 'm a huge fan of their collection . On wood , tile , or linoleum , the cotton rugs need a rug pad or they will slip the Caravan Stripe is in the boy 's room and the Aquinnah is in thekitchen . <p> A lot of you asked about this fun and colorful rug in the study I went with a bolder choice in here since it 's a kid space and I love the greens and blues and the medallion pattern , it 's also an indoor/outdoor rug and is holding up really well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found here . It sheds a little so I have to vacuum it once a week or so , but I do love its pattern and thickness . <p> I love indoor/outdoor rugs for their affordability and great geometric patterns the one on our balcony is from Overstock and would work just as well indoors ! <p> I 'm on the hunt for a better rug in the dining room as soon as I resolve the trestle table dilemma so I 've been pinning a few favorites . My two favorite sources for indoor/outdoor rugs are Overstock and Rugs USA . I 'm not paid to say it , that 's just where I usually start looking for stylish rugs that do n't cost a fortune . Also Target , IKEA , World Market , Shades of Light , and West Elm are places I look too . <p> What 's your favorite source for shopping for rugs ? Scored a good one lately ? <p> Rugs are something that I typically have to do A LOT of searching for before I find the perfect one at the perfect price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug for our bedroom at Home Goods . It was a steal , and oh so trendy . <p> Love your decor choices ! I 'm in the process of going neutral in my family room , and absolutely love your mirrors on the wall in yours . Can you tell me where you bought those ? Thanks so much for the inspiration ! Jen : ) <p> HI Jennifer , the mirrors are from Ballard Designs , they still sell them but they come in black . its a paint to paint them but I did ! Its a windowless room so I use those to " look " like windows and reflect light from the kitchen . Kate <p> Ive been a little hesitant to put indoor/outdoor rugs inside . I feel like they would be stiff or prickly on bare feet . I see you 're using a lot of indoor/outdoor rugs which are great for the budget , but how are they on bare feet or to sit and play on the floor ? <p> I love rugs ! Unfortunately I do n't  have great spaces for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ err ) . However , if anyones shopping for rugs right now , here 's a great groupon for Rugs USA that I got today in my email : <p> I love the runner idea in the kitchen ! I have a long and narrow kitchen as well and always thought something should cover the wood . Never actually thought of using a chunky runner , but what a great look ! Thanks ! <p> Your rugs are always eye catching when you photograph your house . I think it is because there is so much white in your decor not a bad thing ! that it makes them stand out . Love them all . I did order your office one for my daughters room , but we returned it . It was beautiful , but just off on the grey color . Looks great in your office though , I wish it would of worked in her room too . <p> Love your choices do you have a hard time finding a good rug for carpeted rooms ? I love rugs , but we have a lot of carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain type/texture or do you think that anything can work with the rug on carpet look ? <p> I cant comment on Kates gorgeous indoor/outdoor rugs , but I can say that the Dash &amp; Albert indoor/outdoor rugs are fantastic . They do n't  feel plasticky at all ! Plus , you can take them out back and hose them down if the kids spill on it . I honestly did n't  know the rug I was looking at was I/O until the sales girl told me . I 'm really , really wanting one right now <p> Thanks for posting ! I was just online all morning looking for rugs and places that actually ship to Canada . Have you ever bought from wayfair.com ? That seems to be about the only place that ships to Canada . <p> We have mainly carpeted floors because the seller put in new carpet before the house was put on the market ( we bought 6 months ago ) , so seems silly to . I look forward to the day we can replace the carpet , install wood floors and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thanks for sharing , Kate ! <p> Great rugs ! I have a slight rug addiction , I am always switching them out and moving them around my house . I love dash and Albert ones , too . The indoor/outdoor ones are greatthey feel more like indoor rugs . <p> World Market rocks I am in love with their outdoor rugs , which is what we need with two boys and two cats : D We have carpet throughout most of the living areas and I 'm trying to convince my husband that layering an area rug over the nasty beige berber would be an improvement argh ! ! ! <p> Kate ! Thank you so much for this post ! I have been reading your blog for 2 years and dreaming of doing all your projects for a home of my own ! We just bought our 1st house 4 months ago and I have been on a MAD hunt for rugs ( our whole house is hardwood ) . Thank you , thank you ! Question for you , because I love your style . Our living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs will be very close . What do you think about rugs in rooms next door ? Match , mix match ? I do not know what to do ! HELP ! ? ! ? ! <p> Hi Alison I do n't  think rugs have to match , but adjacent rugs should really complement each other . I think the key is to either choose similar styles or colors that coordinate so that they do n't  compete but instead enhance each other . Make sense ? Kate <p> This came just in time ! I need a 9+12 for our den . I have an i/o in the boys room and have been hesitant to buy one for a room that needs to be comfyBUt they are the only ones I can find for a descent price that large.we have 3 kdis and a shedder for a dog ! ! However , I can only find patterns I like on i/o , so maybe I ought to go that way ! ! Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> I have been looking at the same rug that you have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greenish-gray side and I need a pale gray ( blue undertones would be ok but not green ) . What is your opinion on that rug ? I love it but I am always afraid of purchasing rugs online . <p> I 've always been afraid of patterned rugs even though I always love them in other peoples homes so I tend to stick with single solid color rugs . I need to live a little and take a chance . All of your rugs are lovely . I think my favorite is the one in your study . <p> My favorite is the Catalina rug in the study . I HAVE to have it . Maybe in my dining toom , but that means moving a lovely Persian rug to another room in the house which can be done ! Off to find my tape measure : ) <p> Great post , Kate ! ! ! ! ! Can you do a post sometime on the Windows in your Casa ? I 'd love to get some inspiration for new panels in my dining room , and also shades for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woven Wood Blinds post so Ill hunt for that . <p> Wow , thanks again for a great post . I also thought indoor/outdoor rugs would be too rough for little knees to crawl on but I 'm going to look into this for my daycare area . I was buying 9 X 12 rugs from Home Depot at a great price point but they needed to be replaced every couple of years . <p> I have a question that I think you can answer , knowing that you have a cat . I have hardwood flooring throughout my home . I have avoided buying rugs or carpetting because my cat will always pick the carpet to be sick on even if I have a tiny throw rug on the floor and 99% of the area is hardwood , he will always choose the rug . I LOVE the green and blue outdoor rug that you have in your study . Do you think this will be easy to wash off my cats mess ? As well , do you know how well this rug can withstand a cat scratching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffers from this but , my interior decorating is often dictated by the cat . I have a beautiful down-stuffed sofa and love seat set but , the fabric is a bit dated so I bought lovely ( and pricey ) slip covers for them . Lasted all of an hour before the cat got a nail stuck in the fabric and ripped a hole in the ( stretchy ) material . So , to protect my sofas , I crocheted blankets to cover them . The colour is lovely but , it does n't  have the chic look that I was going for it looks more country . When I look at magazines and blogs with beautiful fabric furniture and a cat sitting on it I do n't  understand how the owners manage to maintain it . Do you ( or anyone reading this ) know what I am doing wrong ? I do n't  want to de-claw my cat he s elderly and I think de-clawing is a bit cruel . I do trim his claws regularly <p> Hey Kate ! I adore Dash and Albert as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to use a runner or 2+3 in the kitchen , but was worried how it would hold up with spills and such . How do you clean yours ? ? <p> Beautiful rugs ! Thanks for the inspiration . I love the mixture of prints and colors . I guess I always thought rugs had to be neutral to really work well , but I love the look of the patterned ones . Great ideas ! <p> I currently have a rug over carpet in my living room and it wrinkles up heavily ( which it did not do when it was in the dining room ) . How do you keep yours from wrinkling up when placed over carpet ? Weve tried anchoring it , and using rug tape , but nothing has worked . <p> I also have most of them pinned already . I hate when I find a great rug and it does n't  come in the size that I need . I just bought 2 indoor/outdoor rugs from Ballard Design . Ballard has nice rugs and so does Home Decorators . I love your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love your blog ! Picking the right rug has always been a struggle ! ! ! Except , of course , for the Dash and Albert Diamond Denim one I have one I have in my kitchen ! ! ! They are the best ! I need a rug for my living room my sofa is tan with Ryan Studio a black pillow background and circles , there 's also a solid blue chair and another chair with a subtle blue/cream/tan patter I 'm struggling with what type of pattern I should use that wont compete with the pattern chair and pillows . Do you have any suggestions ? Thank you ! ! <p> I just moved to a home without carpets ( yay ! ) but now need to find area rugs for key spots the hunt is totally wearing me down , so thanks for this post . Any chance there might be a post coming up on rug sizes/placement ? <p> I am so in love with the rug in your study and was about to order it but , I found the $93 shipping cost ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rug to be a bit extreme ! Will be looking at rugs a bit closer to home . What a shame ! It is gorgeous . You have great taste <p> You DO have amazing rugs in your house . I have a couple of questions about the colors that I was hoping you could answer . <p> 1 . What 's the undertone of the beige in your living room ( mocha ) rug ? I have pink-beige tiles and so I need to stay away from anything that 's yellow-beige , which it seems , a lot of rugs use . <p> Oh , and same question for the rug out on your patio . <p> 2 . Can you describe the colors in the rug that 's in your office ? I read the reviews on Overstock and it sounds like its very blue , rather than gray . But it looks quite gray in your picture . <p> Also , is your console table the Hammary Transitions X table ? Ive been eyeing that one , but have n't taken the chance since I did n't  know if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , I have to stay away from the yellow-cream in my house . ) <p> TIA for any extra info you can provide about your lovely rug purchases ! <p> The color I got is Spa Blue . It does she 'd a bit , but it is very thick and looks awesome in our living room . Its an 8+10 rug that was bought and shipped for $197 ! I bought it during their summer sale event . <p> I have just a couple questions can you tell me about the fireplace in the first photo ? It appears to be either electric or gas . Installing a new fireplace is one of my planned projects for this fall , so I would love to hear more about what you did . Also , where did you get the blue settee ? Thank you , Heather <p> Thank you soooooooo much for sharing your rugs and the purchase locations . So many bloggers are not willing to reveal sources despite getting revenue , via number of views , from advertisers on their blogs . We out here in cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , really appreciate all you do and everything that you create via your gorgeous blogsite ! ! ! Thank you , thank you ! ! ! <p> About the rugshave you ever considered stenciling/painting a plain one ? This seems like a very low budget idea since rugs can be so ridiculously expensive . I have seen some tutorials where the end result is pretty great . I would love to see your spin on it ! I have a neutral 8+10 that I am itching to get my foam brush to <p> Update I caved and went back and ordered the green and blue outdoor rug for my living room . I bought it in a smaller size and the shipping was reduced significanlty ( only $14 plus taxes and duty ) . <p> The smaller rug actually may be a better size it will fit under the front legs of my sofa and chairs , and under the coffee table ( which I have n't yet bought will be buying a round metal one with a glass top from IKEA I think its called Vitsjo and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf with a glass shelf ) . I cant wait to see how it all looks ! <p> My question now is as this is an outdoor rug and I will be putting it on hardwood floors , should I have an underpadding ? Does anyone have any recommendations ? <p> Thanks so much for the rug roundup ! I love all of them . I 'm curious what youd think about the indoor/outdoor rug you have in your family room being in a room that gets a lot of play from my barely 1 year old . Do you think the rug would be too rough for a small child to play on with toys ? <p> Hi Kari , I think it depends on your personal preference , the rug is not plush but its not rough either . My kids play on it all the time without complaints ! Its soft enough to sit on with bare skin . Kate <p> Love your rug ! I like Ikea rugs and Ballard Design as well . We got a great dark grey and cream rug from Ikea and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs . We also have an indoor out door rug from Ballard in the dining room that gets daily traffic and it is wearing really well also . Indoor outdoor rugs have come a long way and are my choice for heavy traffic . Rooms now . <p> I 've found that Home Depot ( not sure if they 're everywhere or just West Coast ) has a sale rug bin usually in the back of the carpet department . I found the perfect area rug there for right around $300 . I 've had it over 5 years in a heavy traffic area and its held up great ! 23102 @qwx883102

@@99057953 @3257953/ <h> Mini Kitchen Makeover <p> By Kate Riley July 7 , 2011 <p> So we took a little vacation last week up and down the California coast and we were gone for six days . Apparently , the moment we locked the front door our refrigerator decided to turn itself into an oven , both the refrigerator and freezer I might add . We came home to a dripping , gooey , moldy , horrible , like something out of a Halloween movie mess , with a super fun odor to go with it ! <p> Thankfully , the refrigerator was finally repaired yesterday , it needed a fancy shmancy part , but I lived without it for a week . Why do I tell you this exciting story ? Because of this minor inconvenience I was forced to use the kitchen in our guest studio . Yes , we have a little guest studio above our garage with a small but full kitchen . We 've had tenants over the years , but right now the studio is used for storage and is available for out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this kitchen made me realize I was not in love with the color of the cabinetry , so I decided while I was up there , I might as well just refinish them . I also swapped out the light fixture and added a much needed window shade . <p> Before : <p> After : <p> I swear , it feels twice as big inside with the white cabinets ! <p> The cabinetry you see is actually the same cabinetry that used to be in our kitchen years ago . When we added the studio and new kitchen five years ago , we reused the old kitchen cabinets up here which saved us a lot of dough . We even reused the same sink , faucet , and refrigerator that were still in excellent shape from when the house was first built twelve years ago . Funny , this refrigerator has never given me trouble , but the fancy shmancy one in my kitchen ? It has needed to be repaired twice now , grrr . <p> I decided to use the RustOleum Cabinet Transformations Kit that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would perform on my own cabinets . This 8 ' x 9 ' kitchen was the perfect candidate for a quick fix weekend makeover . I chose the color Linen ' . <p> I also did something unconventional that I 've never done before , I painted the doors and drawer fronts in place ! I did n't bother to remove them like I always have in the past . I just did n't feel like carrying them up and down to my garage in the July heat ! <p> I only got away with it because of the nifty hinges inside the cabinet , I just painted around them with a smaller brush . <p> After the deglossing step , I applied the first layer of the bond coat thin enough that I was n't worried about drips , but thick enough to give good coverage , I was really pleased with it . <p> The bond coat has the fluidity of paint , but the texture of primer once applied . It does dry quickly like a primer , but I did not experience the same amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to which I typically add a conditioner like Floetrol to minimize the drag and brush strokes ) . <p> I did notice after two coats there were small brush strokes on the surface , but if you 're careful in your application and use a good angled brush ( I like the Purdy brand ) brush strokes are minimized , and only noticeable when you get up extremely close to the cabinets . I also noticed in some areas , I needed to go back over the cabinets or drawer fronts with a third touch up coat in spots . <p> The kit also comes with a dark decorative glaze which is optional , but I prefer the clean look without the glaze , so I skipped it . The bond coat dries very flat , which is why you 'll need to add the UV protective coat at the end for a subtle sheen and to seal the bond coat . I have two entire quarts of this protective coat left , which I know I 'll use again and again in the future . <p> The product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow instructions . It retails for $79 for the small kit and $149 for the large . Refinishing cabinets the traditional way , I 'd typically purchase a gallon of primer ( $25 ) a gallon of paint ( $30 ) , a paint conditioner ( $8 ) , brush and sanding wedge ( $20 ) and a quart of protectant ( $12 ) for a total of $95 , so I see this kit ( if buying the large ) as a small splurge for a kitchen project , however the ease of use , easy cleanup , and time savings makes up for the cost difference since there 's no stripping , sanding or priming required . The kits often go on sale at OSH , Home Depot and Lowes . <p> I still stand by my original review of the kit , and I will use this again . I have 2/3 of a gallon of the bond coat left , enough to redo my hall bathroom and perhaps a piece of furniture or two . I do recommend the kit as a great solution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light fixture and added a new shade as well . The industrial style fixture was a find from my local ReStore , I picked it up for $12 and gave it a coat of spray paint on top . <p> I love the contrast between the matte nickel top and shiny white underside , it 's perfect ! <p> The woven shade is Levolor , cut as an outside mount to a few inches beyond the window . You can find them at Lowes in five different colors , they cut them for you in the store , so easy ! <p> Here 's a couple more Before ' and After ' shots : <p> Rug by Dash &amp; Albert . <p> A fantastic result in one weekend ! <p> This post is not sponsored or paid for by Rust-Oleum . It is my honest opinion and evaluation of their Cabinet Transformations Kit based on my personal experience . <p> Your kitchen makeover is amazing white makes such an upbeat change . Thanks for sharing the products you used . I 've noted them in my little book in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That looks so great ! I agree with Ashley.painting cabinets is a lot of work . I know from experience . I could n't believe how light and bright our kitchen became following our kitchen remodel . Check it out below if you are interested ! <p> Thank you SO much for sharing ! The colors in our kitchen are really similar to your before and I 've been dreaming of white cabinets to brighten everything up ! I just pinned the crap out of this post . Hah . <p> I LOVE this little kitchen ! Its bigger than our little apartments by about 6 cabinets and 5 feet of counter space . : ) <p> One questionhow do you think the Rust-oleum Kit holds up compared to redoing cabinets the traditional way ( sanding , priming , etc . ) ? The kitchen is where I spend the majority of my time at homeI need something very durable and high quality ! <p> Wow this is fabulous . I just saw this kit too yesterday at Lowes . Nice to know it works well . I just did a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just too lazy right now . Maybe one dayThanks for sharing ! <p> Looks great ! For a mini-makeover , that looks fantastic , so much brighter and cheerier . I 'm in the process of redoing my kitchen and am installing white cabinets . I like your countertops , any chance you 'd share the make/color with me ? Thanks ! <p> Wow ! I cant help but wonder what is the difference between you a person who takes a disaster as an opportunity to do something awesome ! and me a person who would become overwhelmed to the point of paralysis ! Whatever the difference , I would like to be more like you . : ) <p> Its gorgeous ! I really love the look of white cabinets . I have builder grade oak in my kitchen , and I am so ready to paint them white . I may investigate the Rustoleum cabinet kit you make this look so easy ! Beautiful job ! ! Jenn <p> Oustanding . The before was okay but the after is up to date and modern . I really love the transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future will really appreciate the new kitchen . Its amazing how small changes have such a huge impact . <p> Looks great ! so light and airy ! i keep debating on whether or not i should paint our builder-grade , partially fake wood cabinets . they are the same color as yours were . you definitely have me leaning toward doing it . thanks ! <p> Oh , Kate , fantastic ! ! ! I think its nicer than my REAL kitchenif we had a guest kitchen , it would have to be out in the shed , and I do n't  like to go in there because there may be wasps and also it is hot in there . I do n't  like hot . <p> We have a Levelor bamboo shade in the family room , and I really like it . You 're the second blog today I 've seen using those in the kitchenIm thinking that 's the way I want to go once I get the kitchen painted . Love it with the white cabinets . <p> Shut the front door . Kate , you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeover ? ? ? This is incredible ! ! Fabulous ! Amazing ! Ok Ill stop with all of the adjectives , but you are seriously the bomb . <p> I absolutely love it and cant believe you did it on a whimAND got the whole thing done over the weekend ! Now I need to kick myself into gear and finish my painting projects that have been hanging over me for months ! ! <p> WOW ! I am in love with white kitchens right now , and this is beautiful ! I have a quick question-I painted our old cabinets a couple of years ago , a nd I used black enamel . GaspI know-what was I thinking ? ! ? Anyhow-I loved the black at first , but now I feel like it is so heavy and dark in contrast to the rest of our house . I have been wanting to redo it in white . Can I use a product like this since I used enamel last time ? <p> Once again " Centsational ! ! ! " The kitchen looks so much larger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak cabinets that looked fine , but dated and it was brand new . Your transformation really brought things into this century . Well done Kate , you did it again ! <p> Oh Kateyou come through again ! ( Sorry about the fridge ) BUTthis little kit is the PERFECT product for repainting my laundry room cabinets ! ! ! Now I am inspired to get started ! Just have to convince hubs to paint the ceiling and walls first ! : ) I 'm sure hell be happy to hear that ! Thanks again for sharing ! <p> Ive been wanting to redo our bathroom and kitchen cabinets , and I 've been wondering if it would be better to use this Rustoleum kit or go ahead and buy everything . The kitchen would only need the Small kit anyways , so it seems like maybe its the way to go ? I always love your makeovers . <p> I am so wanting to do this to my kitchen ! We have " oak " and hubs thinks painting over good : " oak " is a crime , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so much bigger ! I am so jealous , you did a fantastic job ! <p> It looks awesome . You just made up my mind for me . I am paining our cheap looking cabinets white . My husband has been begging me to do it since we moved in last year but I always said no . <p> My mom bought a new fansy shmansy dishwasher less than six months ago and it is already not working . Her last dishwasher was a low end and lasted over ten years . Sometimes new does n't  mean better but it doesn look good . <p> I just did a similar project last week , except mine was at our shack in Canada , 13 hours from home . We were getting rid of the original rough lumber ( ugh ) walls and plywood ceiling , and replacing it all with bead board painted for the walls , and varnished pine for the ceiling . We painted the cabinets using Behr Ultra ( w/primer ) and some Floetrol , and they came out surprisingly well for a quickie brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my compressor and had great luck with it on a desk project , so we took it with us to do the doors on the cabinets . Unfortunately , the gasket on the paint pot failed and the gun let me down , so we brush painted the doors too . I would have preferred the sprayed look , but we only had 5 days to get it all done from studs to completion . <p> Did I mention we have to schlep everything to the cottage by boat ? I need a vacation from my vacation ! <p> I just HAVE to show this to my niece , who 's in the process of buying her 1st house . She has a HUGE kitchen with a bazillion cabinets that she 's not thrilled with . Theyre solid oak and she wants white . I told her to paint them and she said " ewwww " . Young naive kid . : ) <p> I love this tiny kitchen ! ! I 've always wanted to paint our kitchen cabinets , but I 'm too scared . We only have nine but I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my head . You make it look so easy , I just might try it . Ive been a follower for a while , but this is my first time commenting . I think your website is absolutely wonderful and very inspiring . Thanks for all the great step-by-step tutorials . Have a great day ! ! -Heather <p> Hey Bethany , great question ! I have no idea how it holds up , this is my first experience using it . Ive used RustOleum products for years without problems , they really have cornered the market on specialty paints that prove durable , I am trusting the companys reputation and my own personal experience with their other products in the past . <p> If I experience any problems , I will surely update this post , but note the kitchen without a tenant does not receive daily wear and tear . My bathroom will though , so that may be a better source of a test of durability when I get around to refinishing those cabinets later this year . <p> My island in my kitchen that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Zinsser oil based primer ( owned by RustOleum ) and Ben Moore oil based semigloss paint . That was over a year ago , and it still looks flawless . <p> Thanks so much for the review and the pictures . We 've already purchased the Transformations kit and were getting ready to start the project this weekend . Weve been looking at using the Linen color , but were concerned that it was too creamy after looking at the samples on the box . After seeing your pictures , it seems that 's the exact color were looking for not bright white , but not off-white either . Your cabinets and countertops are almost the exact same colors as our current ones , so your project just gave us a great idea of what ours will look like . Hopefully ours will turn out as well as yours did ! <p> You have me intrigued about this cabinet refinishing We have the same color cabinets in our kitchen and have been waffling back and forth about leaving them as they are or painting them white . We do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the white cabinets would look with black appliances , but we cant get behind painting them black because that would be too dark . Thanks for the review . I might check it out ! <p> That looks so nice ! I wish that was my everyday kitchen ! We will eventually be repainting our kitchen cabinets and we have been eyeing this productif it is easier than just painting maybe we will check it out ! Thanks ! ! <p> You did that in a weekend ? ? Ive been working on my kitchen cabinets since October . It looks amazing ! ! I think this is the inspiration I needed to pick up my paint brush and finish up my cabinets ! ! Beth <p> Kate , that is one fantastic mini makeover ! It looked great before but now its a very peaceful , light , bright and airy spot . Painting the cabinets white really made your countertops pop and your wall color is beautiful with the white cabinets . Wonderful job ! <p> Wowit does look larger ! . You did n't  mention about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thank you " . I do NOT for the life of me understand builders that put in cabinets without hardware . It always looks cheap and unfinished . Great job ! <p> Kate , it looks FANTASTIC ! What a lovely job . It is so good to see how the kit looks in real life too , and it looks great ! ! I love what you did with the light fixture too , and the shade is just perfect . You did a fabulous job . <p> Oh my gosh ! You say , " I painted my kitchen cabinets ! " like most of us would say , " I just ran to the store ! " I cant believe how quickly you did that ENORMOUS job ! I follow Miss Mustard Seeds blog do n't  know if you do or not but she worked on her kitchen cabinets for what seemed like a long time AND it was a HUGE task . You make it look as easy as making a pot of coffee . Amazing ! AMAZING ! <p> WOW ! I 've wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living and deals with lots of cabinetry and has made the comment that " so many people are going to ruin their cabinets with that stuff ! " . But I 'm so excited to see how easy it was ! and the result is AMAZING ! Love it ! <p> I have seen the samples at the store and they all appear to be somewhat translucent . Does it appear to you opaque or translucent ? Do you think this product would work over painted cabinets as well . Painting my cabinets has been on my " to do " list for over a year but have put off in fear of such a large project as everything seem to take me so much longer than it should . Great job .. looks amazing . <p> That looks great . I am looking to paint my kitchen cabinets white . It makes me want to use this product . But have you ever heard anything about milk paint ? I had a friend who had her cabinets redone and they where painted with milk paint . You could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it " milk " paint . I was just wondering if you have had any experience with it and which method you would prefer . I just do n't  want to see brush strokes in my work . <p> Wow , that looks incredible ! And there 's nothing " mini " about this transformation . Not only does it look a million times better , but I know it was a ton of work ( I repainted my kitchen cabinets , too ) . Great job ! <p> You are so awesome ! ! ! What a beautiful and classic transformation . You are my favorite daily read , and if I ever get up the nerve to take on my own horrid oak cabinets , I 'll send you before and afters ! <p> I 've painted oodles of furniture and just about everything EXCEPT kitchen cabinets . I 'm a nervous wreck I 'll ruin these and keep dragging my feet , but want to get it done this summer . I 'm wanting to go white like you did here with no glaze and need to be able to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times a day : ) Any suggestions ? <p> Painting cabinets can seem like a daunting task , but with the right tools and patience they can come out looking fabulous the way this guest studio . I painted my kitchen cabinets last year ( same oak type ) , but I was n't aware of this Rustoleum kit . I 'm about to do my master bath , will have to take a look at this . Have you every used " Cabinet Coat " or the Ace Hardware version of the same ? Just wondering how they might compare . <p> Hey CG- I LOVE LOVE LOVE the look of this product , do you know if it is available in Canada ? I really would like to try it out on my cabinets but I cant seem to find it any where , and I have been looking since your first post ! Thanks ! <p> I have a question regarding the finished product minus the glaze . I 'd really like my maple cabinets ( same color as yours ) to be white . When I saw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the glaze only and , just going by the pictures on the box , it seemed as if this might be necessary because the coverage was not full . Is this the case or did the paint alone provide full coverage over the color . I want them to be white , not white washed , and so I 'm really looking for it to cover completely . Thanks in advance ! <p> Thanks for posting this . I love the simple , cost-effective transformation of this kitchen ! But even more , I LOVE seeing Before &amp; After shots that actually show the same angles of the space ! ! Its honest and helpful and does n't  distort the story . <p> Hey Roxanne , great question , the glaze is completely optional for those who like that look of a different color in the ridges . I prefer the smooth even color of the paint/bond coat itself . Yes , I did get full coverage with just the bond coat , it took two coats , and even a bit of touch up in several spots after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Love this ! How amazing that you now have 2 very stylish kitchens ! If my husband and I ever make it out to California.Id love to book a few nights in your above the garage " hotel " the way you have described the area it seems that there would be tons to do ! Do you have a vacation rental company that books guests for your garage hotel ? I really love the paint , new shade , and of course the new lighting ! Ca n't believe you got the lighting for that cheap ! Love it all ! <p> Oh , I 'm so sorry about the gooey mess ! I bet it took hours to clean up ! Such a bummer to come home from a vacation and find your house smelly and gross ! I remember when I was in high school my parents and sisters and I came home from a family vacation to the same thing.our deep freezer in the garage stopped working and it smelled like death ! We cleaned and cleaned for hours trying not to gag . I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty frozen turkey goop all over our hot garage ! The stink was horrible ! Glad you had a back up kitchen till the new parts could be ordered ! <p> If you were going to be painting the cabinets in your main kitchen , would you use the Rust-Oleum kit or would you do it the traditional way ( primer , conditioner , paint , etc. ? ) . I am going to be tackling that project soon and would like your opinion . I can not decide which is the better way to go , cost aside . Also , LOVE that light fixture ! <p> I have been dieing to paint my cabinets white . I too have the honey builder grade cabinets . I read on another blog who used the same kit that the protective coat is thin . You did n't  feel as if you needed to remove the doors ? Did you end up with dripping ? Also what colors are the walls and what color did you end up using for the kit . <p> Hey Ali , the thought often crossees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then I think about the cleaning and booking it , and I just throw up my hands wondering if I have time to manage it successfully ! It also has a slightly awkward entrance , you have to go past the garbage cans ( thrilling ) and wind your way through our back yards not too pretty spots . Maybe someday ! It works out much better to have a full time tenant like we have in the past , well probably rent it out again soon ! Kate <p> Roxanne K , great question ! ! ! I used the traditional method in my kitchen which I know for a fact is a no fail . Using an oil based bonding primer ( Zinsser ) plus two coats of oil based semigloss mixed with conditioning Penetrol made for the smoothest finish Ive ever achieved with a roller and brush . Also , there have been absolutely no problems to date , no scratching , no peeling , no chipping , and the island gets daily wear and tear . However , working with oil based products is stinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note , if I was repainting kitchen cabinets white in the traditional method , I would use the same Zinsser oil based primer but would choose latex paint , not oil , since white oil based paints will amber or yellow over time , but white latex paints will not . <p> I like the CT kit for the ease of use and low odor , and the fact its water based which makes life a whole lot easier when you 're redoing an entire kitchen . It does have that advantage . I did not get an absolutely 100% smooth finish ( which I mentioned ) like I did on my kitchen island by using the traditional method . Up close , you can see thin brush strokes on the studio kitchen cabinetry . <p> The big question , what would I do in the future ? It just depends . For speed and ease of use , I 'd choose the CT kit , for a close to flawless finish , I 'd choose the traditional method . Both are perfectly acceptable ways for a DIY refinishing job on cabinetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You add it to the paint color . It keeps paint brush strokes from happening . But invest in a quality paint brush like Wooster . I have used it and it works great . No brush strokes visible . <p> I read this post this morning , and had to stop back again tonight to say that I ca n't stop thinking about that light fixture ! I too , love the contrast of matte and glossy , and at 12 bucks ! ? ! Wow . I 'm on the hunt to do something similar this weekend now ! Thanks for the inspiration . <p> One question though do you have to prime the glass/metal/chain before spraying it silver ? I never knew you could paint glass ! ? <p> I actually just purchased this kit today , with hopes of tackling my kitchen while two of the kids are at daycamp next week . In the FAQs on the rustoleum website , they say you can use a roller to achieve the smooth finish if you are not using the glaze . They encourage a brush if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stroke marks left from the Bond Coat . Also , on the FAQs they tell you how to spray the product on as well , but only if you do not want to use the Glaze . I am hoping to glaze mine after reading the results from someone else ! I LOVE the finished product in this kitchen ! <p> Kate , it turned out amazing ! Love the new light fixture , too ! I feel your pain about the refrigerator . When I bought a new one , it had a problem with the icemaker within just a few months . They just seem to make things cheaper now , instead of better . Discouraging . But your guest kitchen turned out beautifully ! Bright and cheerfullove the transformation ! <p> Fabulous ! Our kitchen is fine , but for years I 've been wanting to refinish the cabinet on my husbands 80 gallon aquarium which is beautiful with the exception of the circa 74 cabinet . This might just do the trick . Thanks ! <p> Wow Kate , Home from vacation and right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I am planning on repainting my kitchen and laundry room cabinets . I want to do the lower cabinets in the kitchen a blue . I will have to look at the Rustoleum color selection . Thanks for inspiring us ! <p> Great post ! I wish we owned our home so we could do things like this ! I really love the transformation that you went through and the white cabinets look great ! It looks really upscale and very nice ! Great job . love the site ! You 're on my reader now ! <p> Great redo ! I 'm looking at this exact product right now for my aqua kitchen . I have a question for you . How would you classify the Linen color ? Ive been looking at the pure white and the linen and cant decide between the two . My trim is plain white , but I was thinking of a little softer white for the cabinets without being too ivory . I really wish rustoleum had chips for their colors . <p> Looks fantastic ! I love those changes that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same luck with the Cabinet Transformations product . And I really wanted to love it ( probably would have if we got the results you did ) ! We were getting really poor coverage and after four coats of the bond coat , our golden oak cabinets looked like they had two coats of primer on them . Sadly , we had to abort and convert to my old standby method with SW Pro Classic enamel . Now they 're looking beautiful We just have to wait for them to cure . : ) <p> WOW ! ! ! Ive been waiting to revamp our builder grade kitchen cabinets for a while , and this is truly inspiration to just do it ! I was shocked to see the before and then the after because the before is my kitchen literally every surface ( except I have tile looking linoleum flooring ) . What a GREAT facelift ! <p> This looks great ! You have really made a transformation to this kitchen ! I 'm a little confused though which kitchen is yours ? You have another kitchen pictured in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kitchen pictured is in Painting Wood under Painting Kitchen Cabinets from March 2010 . <p> I 'm definitely trying this in my bathroomsno sanding or priming makes me a happy girl ! ! I just refinished our kitchen cabinets and man what a job ! They look awesome but it was so much work ! ! Thanks for the review ! <p> I was at Home Depot tonight and saw this . I had decided to paint my cherry wood cabinets this summer and so I noticed the set-up when I walked by . I really had planned on painting them white . I am seeing mixed reviews all over when people did n't  use the glaze . What do you think made yours work where others did n't  ? Did you use a roller ? <p> This is such a huge undertaking and I am nervous enough as it is doing it on my own . My husbands is extremely leery and trying to talk me out of it . <p> My husband and I just finished our cabinets with this kit . It took us a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to say that the De-glosser is what makes this kit so fantastic and easy , it saved hours of sanding . <p> We purchased the Purdey brush as suggested by you , and we used a sponge roller . We used the roller for the paint ( along with the brush for tighter spots ) . But when it came to doing the last step , putting on the top coat , we used just the Purdey brush ( you were so " spot on " with that brand of brushexcellent ) . I would suggest to others to go back and check the work you did once youve finished an area . Just when we thought we had it all smoothed out we would go back and find a place that had globbed up in spotsand believe me , you want it all smooth . <p> We used the light kit on our oak cabinets . I chose the color Linen . I have to say that the color was a little disappointing , it just looks white , and I was looking for , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glaze ( I did n't  want the wood grain on my cabinets to stand out ) . I read many , many reviews for this product and heard a few people say that the colors are true to what is on the box , but was not the case once on our cabinets . <p> Overall , the cabinets turned out great and gave us a much needed make-over . We are now applying the Rustoleum Countertop Transformations as I type . We picked Onyx . It was very tough to those the countertop color . I wanted to find close up pictures of each of the colors , other than what was on the boxI did n't  have much luck . I 'm hoping there is a little definition in what we picked , and it does n't  look just black . Will have to let you all know . <p> If you need a kitchen make-over and do n't  have the budget for a brand new kitchenthis is the kit for you ! <p> Love the cabinets ! Debating on how to do ours and wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also want to if you have any sugestions on how to best paint base trim and doors . Thanks ! Kate <p> How in the heck did I miss this ? ! ? ! ? ! Painted the cabinets with the doors still on ? Oh junk ! Those are the same hinges I have on my doors ! Ok , let me calm down . I 'm going to do that for my bottom cabinets ! LONG ... <p> LOVE it ! ! I am painting my kitchen cabinets too and Ive never heard of this before ! I will definitely try it . I have a question before : My cabinets are dark cherry color so do you think with two coats will be enough ? will it work ? I want to paint them white-off white . THANK YOU ! ! ! ! Ana <p> Looks great ! My husband and I will actually be painting our kitchen cabinets this weekend using this same kit . I had a question about the color : I noticed that you have a white stove and you chose the Linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . They look good in the picture , but how about real life ? I 'm still unsure as to whether to choose Linen or Pure White ( both unglazed ) to paint our kitchen . We still have a mix of stainless and white appliances , and our trim color is pure white . What would you suggest ? <p> You have inspired me ! The cabints at our cottage are in desperate need of TLC ! They are mahogany that has been oiled over the years . I refuse to spend $ on new cabinets , and having seen this post I now know what to do ! I knew I wanted to paint them out , but was unsure of the process , not now ! Thank you , thank you , thank you ! <p> You have no idea how excited I am about this ! I have been wanting to paint our cabinets , but have been putting it off just thinking about the sanding process . I am going to the hardware store for this ASAP ! ! Any advice for painting the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge pain in the ass . <p> Hey Nikki , I do n't  think its necessary to paint the inside itself , but whether you paint the inside of the doors is your call , I prefer them painted for a universal look but it will take more time ! Kate <p> Hi Rachel , great question ! Its our guest house kitchen so its not used daily , only a few times a month , but so far so good . i think if you 're using it on a bathroom or kitchen I 'd use two of the final protective coats , just for added durability . <p> I am considering painting my grandmothers piano with this product . I have 4 boys and they have not been kind to my treasure ; scratches and name carving , etc . Do you think I should sand those out before starting ? <p> Great question Chris ! Chalk paint is for furniture and I 'm not sure how well it holds up to moisture , so in your case I 'd choose the RustOleum product , or you could refinish it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint designed for LONG ... Kate <p> I 'm looking into painting my oak cabinets . I know you love this product but I was wondering if you have ever used milk paint ? And if so how they compare ? ? My friend did her cabinet with milk paint and there are no brush strokes . <p> I have laminated cabinets . You know those yucky things from the 70s . Do you think this product would work well on them ? I 'm desperate to find something to update my poor little kitchen without doing a complete uber expensive remodel . <p> I used the Rustoleum Cabinet Transformation kit in Linen about 6 months ago . I 'm now noticing yellow streaks in my pretty white cabinets . I 'm thinking its the protective top coat turning yellow with time . I am NOT HAPPY with this product anymore and will never use it again . I wish I would have just painted my cabinets the old fashion way . Lesson learned . <p> Might I ask what kind of spray paint you used , is it also Rustoleum ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find out if it would work to spray paint my old yucky brass doorknobs , hinges etc or if I ought to spend the cash for new pieces ? <p> Hi Kate , is this a good product ove already painted cabinets ? Or should i just use standard paint ? I 'm painting the walls camouflage . Is linen or white best . I was also thinking a soft darker shade of grey green might be nice . its a small kitchen . <p> Do you think that Rustoleum Transformations will work for painting honey oak moulding and trim work white ? I am sure it is a time consuming process , but I have relatively new trim and moulding in my new home , but I want it white . <p> Does anyone know how to handle mistakes with this product ? We had a disaster after glazing . Cabinets fell and got nicked . We tried to touch up with base coat over the damaged areas . I only did one coat of the base . When I tried to reglaze , the glaze did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start over with the damaged cabinet ( degloss , base and then glaze again ) ? Will I be able to glaze over properly if I put another coat of base ? <p> I am looking into using this product for painting my cabinets . I want to do white as well but I 'm terrified of the protective coat making it yellow over time . Since its been a while had yours yellowed or stayed white ? ? 23102 @qwx883102

I 'd paint mine shabby white , forget the shelves and put it in my bedroom decorated with dried flowers and vintage linens . Thanks for the post , now I have a starting point to search for a ladder : ) <p> Thank you for your compliments on my ladder shelves . To answer Sheila Gs question , I did n't  attach mine to the wall because it is stable enough .

Ive been on a long time search for an affordable/used ladder but no luck so far . I do have one question . I 'm currently building a shelving unit for my bedroom ( will hopefully post soon weee ! ) but the guy at Home Depot said its not recommended to screw wood together and that nailing is preferred because screws can split the wood , and its the pressure of the nails that actually keep a tight fit . I noticed Brittany used screws and was wondering if I could take a risk and use screws too because hammering nails in is extremely awkward and taking forever ! ! Thanks ! <p> Sweet ! Thanks very much . I managed to get an antique round rung ladder from a gent closing out at a Flee market . Perfect for hanging my quilts on . FOR ABOVE : You go girl ! I told my Dad .

I wont get started on the big Orange ( I 'm a Blue girl myself ) butthat is the craziest thing Ive ever heard . It is true that the screws can split the wood , but that is why you should always pre-drill your holes . And if you think about it , a screw has the extra spiral that extends beyond the shaft of the fastener , giving more resistance and keeping it from pulling out of the wood . Where as a nail does n't  have much resistance . If I am going to use nails , I almost always will use glue also as an added fastener . I hope that helps . <p> I 'm a carpenter and just wanted to point out some tips to readers . I would recommend NOT using Gorilla Glue for this project . Not that it does n't  work ( it obviously works ) , but I would use carpenters glue ( wood glue ) instead . 2 reasons : <p> 1 . Gorilla Glue expands when it dries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELL to sand later . Wood glue sands very easily on the other hand . If you do have some monkey glue hanging around ( pun intended ) and you want to use it , be careful not to use too much . If you accidentally gloop a bunch on , use a wet cloth to wipe the excess off . <p> 2 . Your using a nail gun , so you do n't  need the strength of monkey glue . Inexpensive wood glue works fine here . <p> I LOVE this shelf ! I 'm totally honored you think I 'd build this because I think its BETTER than what I could pull off . : ) Incredibly creative !

I agree with you about the planters , but why not try a fun , poppy color like blue or green ? Just to add a splash of color ? Just an idea . I usually turn to white , too , but I 've been trying to add color , just to mix things up . <p> Looks pretty ! Grays are so hard ! We painted our kitchen island last week Coventry Gray and it looks light purple . It is getting a new color with more beige in the gray later today . Going with either SW Amazing Gray or Mega Greige . Crossing my fingers for the look I 'm after . <p> Looks great I do n't  see a lot of gray doors and this is a good look ! <p> Gray is SO hard to get right . A lot of rooms in my house are painted gray , but my favorite gray out of them is Sherwin Williams monorail silver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bluish . <p> How funny ! I just painted my door BM Stratton Blue on Friday and I love it . Fortunately , my door was in desperate need of new paint and there was n't a drop of gloss on there , so really it just needed a good cleaning before hand . <p> My door went from white to black last year and I LOVE it ! I painted my lanterns too . What difference a little spray paint on the lanterns can make . Delight ! Your urn comment cracked me up ! But , why not go black instead of white ? Your plants will " pop " more and they will look so cool when the weather finally turns a bit cooler ( 106 in Texas today ) with the fall colors . <p> Love the gray and I 'm not a huge gray lover . I painted my front door red and it was a nightmare . I did n't  really know what I was doing though , but I like the finished result : LONG ... If you visit , please read more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its not my best post : - ) <p> Great transformation ! I painted my front door , using the same BM paint in Stratton Blue . It was a bit of an ordeal choosing the right color , but now I love it . I also spray painted my brass hardware ORB as a temporary fix until I can buy new . Ca n't wait to see what you do with the urns . <p> I love gray ! One day I am going to paint my place gray , I read an article once about painting with gray ( I think it was Real Simple ) and they called it " Paris Apartment Gray " . That is the color for me , I simply adore Paris and Gray . What more could I ask for ? <p> My formerly-white front door now POPS against the brick exterior with a gorgeous Bahama blue . The hubs , who wanted to keep it white , calls it " Smurftastic " but I 'm sure hell come around eventually . : ) <p> The gray for the door looks amazing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a true gray rather than a bluer one ; bluer would probably have contrasted with the stucco too much . <p> The lamp looks great ! Matching the nickel on the door was absolutely the right choice . I like that you kept it white , as well . And you 're 100% right about the urns ; they should be repainted , as its a bit too gray around the front right now . That said , those are really beautiful . <p> Love the grey its quiet and sophisticated . If it were me , I 'd dry brush some white on those urns to pick up the highlights . I bet you 'd love it . Itd be QUICK and if you did happen to dislike it you could always repaint . : ) <p> Fabulous , as always ! ! ! You inspire me to finish up all the half done projects so we can enjoy our last week of holidays before back to school Aug 25th.lets see if my enthusiasm lasts ! Love everything about your porch , wish i had more than just a door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And getting rid of the black threshold really made a difference . I hope it holds up well . My back entry is gray , so I know how hard it is to pick a tone . I painted my door a navy blue , so of course I went with a more blue gray rather than a taupe gray . Love my navy blue door though ! I agree that the planters need to be a different color than grayit just looks too matchy-matchy . White sounds right . The lights turned out beautiful . Thank heavens for all the spray paint choices . It all looks lovely together ! ( Our kids start school next week also . I 'm a teacher so I start Thursday . ) <p> I 'm with Amanda paint the urns a color thatll pop . How about a green to go with the cushions on your chairs ? My house is navy blue with white trim and apple green doors . It makes me smile every time I look at it ! <p> Love the gray you picked ! I 'm so loving gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and light fixtures and I agree with you on the urns . : ) We painted our front door last year using the appropriate primer and exterior paint and it BUBBLED terribly after several months . My poor hubs had to sand it all off , it was a huge mess . The paint store people were baffled as to why it bubbled . If it happens again were getting a new door . : ) <p> I agree about the urnsand I like what someone else said-maybe go bold on those for a pop of color ? I like the green on your rug/pillowor like your daughter pointed out , a purple-ish would be smashing with your lavender plants ! <p> I used to live in TX , where school starts next week for teachers-now I am in Oregon , where sanity prevails in the school calendar-we start after labor day : ) ) ) ) ) I am off to finish a gallery wall to today , and have mucho plants to plant this AM before the sun gets higher and the temperature climbs-its the " get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grey door ! We just bought our house and it came with green ( not a good green ) shudders and a matching green front door . Against the red brick , I swear it looked like Christmas year round at our house . Changed out the green for a nice , bold cobalt blue on the door and shudders . I 'm in love with it . Now I love coming home and feel that it makes our house stand out in a good way vs. a we celebrate Christmas year-round sort of way . Great job ! <p> This is such a great makeover ! The wall sconce looks completely new and I LOVE the shade on the door ! We repainted our door ( black ) a few months ago and I still love it ! I think you should do a fun color on the urns.maybe a green to match your other porch decor.just a thought ! <p> OMGironically , I 'm in the process of painting my front door , sidelites and thinking about painting the screen door . BUT , the sidelites have so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old paint first , and then go from there . Of course , the hubby put on sealant strips around the front door to keep out drafts , so I have to remove those first , then goo gone the sticky residue and finally , and then .. whew .. I can paint everything . FYI- I chose a barn door red ! Jackie <p> Ive been mulling over a front door color for a while now but am having a hard time . That 's not a space in my house that I want to go through the trouble of painting without being completely sold on the color . Too much work . But my favorite gray right now is BM Grant Beige . We just used it in a clients house and its the perfect background for the warm wood trim and cool grays in the stone veneer . Its neutral but not boring . Love it . <p> I totally agree with Marnita . Paint the urns peacock blue ! ! Especially if you are keeping greenery in them . I would go white if you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of grey for the door . <p> It looks gorgeous ! But yeah , I can see why you 'd want to repaint the urns . : ) I had my new bedroom ( moving day is this Saturday , eek ! ) painted BM Gray Owl and I 'm in love ! It trends kinda green which works with my color scheme . Ca n't wait to move in and get all situated ! <p> I think your door looks wonderful . I desperately need to paint my front door as the folks who lived here before me apparently put just one coat on over the pre-primed new door . My house is a pretty shade of yellow with cranberry trim . I would love to have a door that showed dirt less than my current white one but I am afraid with the house colors I am stuck ! <p> I love your newly painted door ! My house itself is gray so when we decided to redo our front door we chose black to make it stand out with the gray stucco and red trim . i did want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major research on painting doors and so we went with this paint called Hollandlac . It is a paint made in Holland that is used on all of the doors over there . I blogged about it too if you want to see the outcome and read my review of the paint . It is pretty expensive ( $48 a quart ! ! ! ! ! ) but well worth it in my opinion . The coverage is great . I 'm waiting to see if it holds up as long as they say it will though . I guess only time will tell . I love your front porch and the newly painted door . Everything looks great ! Oh , the post about my door painting experience is here : LONG ... <p> So , I 'm planning on painting our front door and I 'm so FREAKING nervous . The web is buzzing with information about how to paint a metal door . I 'm cool with the deglossing and the type of paint , but how did you apply it ? Brush , roller or spray ? I 'm not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fine ? <p> I love your transformation . The door looks great . You 're right . Grays are hard to choose because they can have so many different undertones . Ive been trying to find the perfect gray for my study/office for a while now . I would suggest painting the urns either green or blue . A deep blue would look beautiful with the gray door , creamy yellow siding , and green pillows . <p> Love the gray , Kate ! I live in an apartment complex and the property owner had the place painted two summers ago . They went from white ( always dirty looking ) to a medium gray with white trim and dark gray stairs and landings . They painted the doors a maroon color with a very high gloss and put the cutest number plaques on them . <p> Not a huge fan of gray for indoors , however . Here in Seattle where its gray skies most of the year , indoor gray feels too depressing for me . I worked for a long time at a place where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rebelled and painted it with a color scheme of eggplant , teal and dusty rose . It was much better ! <p> I 've always always ALWAYS wanted a red door but thought it was too bold . Everytime I 'd go to the paint or home improvement stores , I found myself wandering over to the " reds " . After several years ( literally ) I finally found the perfect shade ( Chianti Behr ) and now my door is fabulous ! ! <p> I love your choice of gray . Its muted and timeless . You have such a knack with colour and accessories . <p> I think you chose the perfect gray for your front door . It looks beautiful ! I think I went through about 40 grays for our guest room and had such a hard time finding one that worked with the lighting , different times of day , etc . Gray is a tricky color . Your daughter looks like a mini you ! Shes so cute and so is your son . <p> I love the new door color but also think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green you have in your rug/pillows or something brighter that coordinates with your flowers ( I see a lovely hot pink in some of the flowers but that may be a bit much for the male contingent in your house ! ) <p> We painted our double front door a welcoming shade of Red called ValsparG 1010-4 La Fonda Geranium Red . Its just right with our brick , and a fabulous change from the drab dried up black it used to be . The brass kick plate also looked horrifying , so I tried to clean it with everything including Brasso , but nuthin worked . So , we took the kick plate off the door , spray painted it an old brass , and put that sucker right back on . Looks SO much better . Cheap facelift . : ) <p> I love gray . It is classic , elegant and a true " neutral " . A gallon of " Polished Silver " by Valspar is patiently waiting to cover my office walls . Well see how it goes ! Anyone else happen to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the urns needing to contribute some weight . How bout painting them blackor some dark-metallic finish ? Youd also be even more ready for Halloweencould stack graduated pumpkins on them orOK I admit it , I will paint something black at the drop of cloth . Very nice gray , by the way . <p> Actually , I 'm only about to paint my front door . I 've got Martha Stewarts " Etched Glass " ( a subtle blue ) , and some Zinsser 1-2-3 primer . I 'm thinking Ill ORB the hardware while I 'm at it , although my last attempt at ORBing something metal failed dismally . . . so the jury is still out on that one . <p> Thanks so much for the post . . . it reminded me that this is n't such a huge task after all ! <p> I re-painted both my front and back door recently , and love how they turned out ! Were getting ready to sell our house and wanted to have everything fresh and shiny as can be . I used Rust-Oleums door paint in a satin finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door . ( It was white and boring before and now looks a million times better ! Here is my blog post about it : LONG ... <p> I think it turned out great ! Not to mention the darling kids ! Maybe something easy to try to help you love your urns more is some kind of wash /glaze to highlight the details . Should make them stand out and might be more fun than repainting at least until you get the energy . Thanks for sharing ! <p> I always LOVE what you do ! ! But this time , not so much . I do n't  think its dark enough . Maybe it ; s just the light . And I think the fixtures would have been better with the white painted also . They kind of blend in to the facade . I guess there just is n't enough contrast for me . But I usually LOVE LOVE LOVE your transformations ! ! <p> I am going to be painting my front door this fall once the humidity drops . I am actually going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to say I would paint your planters either a bright colour ( like teal or yellow etc ) OR black . White will blend in too much I think . Erin <p> I like your grey door ! I 'm not much of a grey person myself but I admire its sophistication and subtlety in other peoples spaces . I think you made the right choice to go with the true greythatll go with everything ! You could even choose a bold color for your planters , because your grey door will be the perfect counterpoint . <p> My favorite front door color is probably a Charleston greenyou know that dark , dark green that reads almost black ? I still love a Talbots red front door , too . And I just adore a French blue door . My own front door is mahogany , so as long as Im married itll probably never be painted . I 'd love to have it stripped down and completely refinished , though . The wood is indeed beautiful , but its looking a bit weatheredlike a woman with colored hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Hi . I am new to your blog so have n't seen very much yet . The front of your house from the photos , appears to be a warm beige colour so why did you go with grey ? Also , from the photos I preferred the classic black threshold as it gave it some anchor . <p> I might be too traditional , but I actually liked the white door better ! It was a part of your classy home and the use of light of your front porch . The gray does n't  look bad , I 'll be honest , but I think the white was just perfect . <p> This weekend I painted my girls room Sherwin Williams Repose Grey . I love it ! I am planning on painting our front door . We would love to have a new door but cant afford it at the moment . I am thinking Benjamin Moore Midsummer Night . The siding we have currently is a yellow color ( soon to be changed to Granite ) . I have always struggled with deciding on a color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart Living . The house had same color siding as we do . The grey looks great on your door ! <p> I would vote for more contrast , too . Painting the urns and your lanterns black would provide contrast and balance . Larger lanterns would be ideal . I think some color in the urns would be beautiful , as well . How about something in the coral/pinkish range ? ? Front door " head turners " always have great color and unexpected somethings that make one say , " WOW ! " . and , want to turn around to see it again . <p> Ooooh I 'm digging the gray , Kate ! I love that you let that be a family affair I 'm such a control freak , I ask everyone what they think and then I go with MY choice ! I painted my lights without taking them down just taped newspaper around them , took the glass out and spraypainted away . It worked like a charm and who knew cleaning those bugs out could make such a difference ! Your entry is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you paint those urns again , why not take some watered down black paint and rub it over the surace letting more settle in the grooves of the relief . I think it would make them look very elegant . <p> I just painted our front door as wellI went with a coastal blue mistint from home depot and I love it . Unfortunately I did not rough up the door before painting it ( idiot ! ) and every time the keys bang it the paint scrapes off ! Hmm , that 's my downfalldo it in a hurry , forget the all-important prep ! Yours looks great , and altho I tend to lean toward the blues ( your daughters lavender-hued paint ) I think the gray you ended up going with is great from your door ! Nice work ! <p> My front door is crimson . Color matched to a University of Alabama cap . I love it and have kept it this color for several years . The body of the house is light gray with dark gray trim . I really , really love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't  want to hurt your feelings , but I 'm not digging the grey with the color of your house , maybe its the urns that 's making me not like it ? I think a deeper color for the door would have been better and preferrably not grey . I usually like all your design choices , but this one not so much . <p> Nice grayyoure right gray can be tricky . Thanks for giving us the low down on that new paint for outdoors and for the Rustoleum color tip . I 'm a Realtor and seem to always be telling folks to paint their front doors and outside lights . Sometimes new lights can be a big headachethey might not fit the existing holes and then you have to call the electricianso painting can be the answer . I 'd repaint the urns , too . How about that paint that looks like stone ? I 've never used it , but it looks good in the ad . Your mini " entrance face lift " looks great . <p> I want to paint our front door so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought our house and it has aluminum siding that is purple , yes I said purple , it is a light lavendar i guess on a grey scale . We are trying to decide what color and grey is the only color we can think of . I am wondering if I should try this while my hubby is at home but scared to do it by myself . I honestly have n't painted anything but have been reading blogs for months now &amp; think I am a pro LOL : ) Btw , I think your door looks great ! ! ! <p> As for that threshold , I noticed on our ( new construction ) home that the thresholds were installed during the framing phase , and the builder never put anything down to protect them . I ground my teeth every time I came out and looked at the progress during the building phase . <p> When the construction was complete , how did they clean up those messy beat up thresholds ? Spray paint ! <p> And our builder is one with a pretty good reputation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its done ! I did notice some peeling when another contractor put blue tape on the threshold ( post-construction ) . The builder came out and retouched the paint . So maybe avoid putting any blue tape on it if you can . <p> I 'm thinking that paint on your threshold will hold up just fine . And I love how you painted it the same color as the door . It DOES look better than black ! <p> Great porch transformation ! I love painted front doors , and when it was time to pick our door color , I went to Home Depot with my 4-year-old daughter to look at paint colors . The house is green with white trim and some taupe accents , and I was considering reds and browns for the door , but my daughter brought over a dark purple swatch , and it looked fabulous with the other colors ! I color-matched it to Ben Moores " Walnut , " which sounds brown but reads dark purple next to the green and white . I 'm big on contrasts , so I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What about that dark greeny-blue crayon color called midnight blue ? <p> Its amazing what a little paint can do ! I love the colors you selected . We want to repaint our office and these are great colors to consider ! It seems like gray is the new beige . Where did you get your pillows ? I love the color and pattern ! <p> I love the gray door , though normally I 'm not a big gray person . I am such a front door person , I think it makes the whole house . Anyway , I 've been a lurker , now I 'm coming clean and must ask you about Nate Berkus . How cute is he and does he smell good ? I love him and love your blog . Thanks for all .. your children are adorable ! <p> I would wait till at least Halloween to paint the urns ( perfect for Halloween ) . I agree with Evelyn . The urns new a darker color . Maybe something that coordinates with your green and white pillows . I love the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was torn between the mens choice and your original choice , too . About the urns : Have you thought about glazing/antiquing the urns to add some dimension ? It might look ama-za-zing ! Or , I think a little contrast with some ORB-esque darker color would look very chic as well . Good luck ! <p> Is your door made of wood or is it a type of laminate ? I have a very similar designed door , and mine is this weird wood-looking laminate . I hate how it looks , but I think the right paint may make it much improved . Just wondering how that will come out since its not actually made out of wood . <p> BTW , I just found your blog today and am obsessed ! Ive been reading through posts for hours : ) <p> Hi , I was curious to see how your threshold is holding up ? We need to replace our door knob and I want a different color but I know the threshold is hard to change out . I am thinking of painting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option ! Thanks ! <p> When in doubt I know I can always count on you ! Haha . I 'm going against the rules today and painting my metal threshold all because I googled it and there came your post . Silly me.should have just checked the blog before googling , should of known you tried it ! Thanks : ) <p> hi That is a great looking front door . what would you do if the door is painted with an oil based paint . i am also looking to paint it now in a latex based one . thanks and your site is a great inspiration . <p> Hello Aparna , between oil based paint and water based paint , you should use a coat of water based primer . Look for an enamel paint for doors and trim , Benjmin Moore and Sherwin Williams both sell water based enamel paints for doors and trim . Kate <p> Hi , A few questions .. How long did it take the paint to dry ? How many coats ? I been wanting to paint my front door for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open while the paint dried , call me crazy but with my luck a bird or something worst will fly in my house . According to the research Ive done it takes like 24hrs for outside paint to dry . <p> I love the door was thinking of painting ours a bright color but I just re-painted ( in the process r really ) my whole house . I choose blues and greens to tone down what I had so this great is going to be perfect on my front door ! ! My last project is my bedroom walls and they are also going to be gray just was wondering if you had any suggestions to bedroom gray colors : ) 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057957 @3257957/ <h> Analysis of a Well Styled Bookcase <p> By Kate Riley June 15 , 2011 <p> I truly love to see bookcases in homes because they are the perfect solution for adding storage and style to your surroundings . Books and collectibles on display add warmth and personality to any space , whether it 's a living or dining area , bedroom or home office . To any visitor , a bookcase will communicate what you read , what you collect , and what you love . Bookcases are a window into your passions and pursuits , and an opportunity for you to put your most favorite things on display . <p> The challenge for most people is how to style a bookcase well . How do you maximize both utility and aesthetic appeal , but also avoid monotony and clutter ? Styling a bookcase is an art , but a job easily tackled if you study those done right . <p> Analysis of a well styled bookcase : <p> It Starts at the Back . Simple inexpensive bookcases become stunners when their backs are dressed up with paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to life with a pattern that accentuates the balanced display of books and collectibles . <p> Think in Layers . Here is a shelf masterfully styled by Emily Henderson . Notice the balance achieved between the books alternating in placement from left to right with the ceramics poised on the opposite side . The middle shelf repeats the books plus ceramics combination , and also provides the opportunity to display smaller collectibles . Different heights and textures also add to the appeal . <p> Vary Book Placement . Did you know there are 7 ways to stack books ? Karen from The Art of Doing Stuff teaches us how she styled hers in her IKEA Billy bookcases to break up the columns . Notice how she does n't just stick to books , she adds art and natural objects too . And do n't you love that reading chair ? <p> Arrange Books by Color . Inside this IKEA Expedit , the books are grouped by color , and also displayed both horizontally and vertically . Practical baskets mix with glass bowls , vases and collectibles to form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hang Something . There 's no rule you have to keep it all inside . Why not add one more layer of interest ? Consider using the framing of the bookcases to suspend a dramatic mirror , framed artwork , or sentimental photographs . <p> It 's OK to be Single . Smaller cubbies look simply perfect with a textured or sculptural object placed all by itself . Notice the use of a single vase or shell in the smaller spaces of John &amp; Sherry 's bookcase , and the fantastic contrast with bold blue and crisp white . <p> Think Oddly . Objects tend to look better when gathered in odd numbers , and the basic design principle of the rule of threes is cleverly applied in this bookcase featured in Lonny Magazine . Notice how most of the books are stacked horizontally , but the bookcase becomes so stylish with the varied and perfectly placed decorative objects , prints , and forward facing book covers . <p> Varied groupings of three or five are always visually appealing . This bookcase from the home of Lisa Martensen is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travels all around the world . <p> Allow Room to Breathe . With airy shelving , it 's best to not overwhelm and allow for plenty of breathing room around objects . Deliberate use of open space keeps the eclectic collection on this bookshelf from appearing too cluttered . <p> With a little concentration , it 's possible to style a bookshelf well with both books and the things you love . The secret to doing it successfully is truly all in the placement and editing of your favorite objects . <p> How timely ! I just posted last week how I shopped my own house to turn a cluttered built-in bookcase into something functional and pretty . Sometimes you just have to clear everything off for a fresh perspective ! You can see the results at LONG ... <p> i want a built in sooo freaking bad ! ! sense i cant have onei bought a white one and filled that sucker up ! i love it ! i 'm going to post a pic on friday over at **27;1481;TOOLONG along with my garage sale frame a revamped ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just styled my bookcase right OUT of the house ! ! ! Even when it looked stylish , it was a dust collector ! ! ! ! lol I got tired of the upkeep . Maybe someday it will make its way back in . But for now.not so much ! lol : ) <p> It is really hard for me to " style " a bookcase , even though I love the way styled ones look . I 'm a librarian , see , so my books ( of which there are many not just a few art books or a stack of design magazines ) need to be in order . Its very hard for me to purposefully put them out of order in order to make it look aesthetically pleasing . Any tips for how to style a bookcase when you 're trying to keep your books findable ? <p> I like the look of a decorated book case , but in actuality I feel that bookcases should be over packed , and a bit " cluttered " . I am wondering if there are any examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decor style ? <p> I love this ! I just set up Crate and Barrels Sloane leaning media cabinet/bookshelves in my living room and I 'm at a loss how to style them . They 're a little modern for my taste but we needed something and the price was right we bought 2 of the pieces off craigslist and the other with a friends C&amp;B discount for a total of $300 . I cant wait to experiement with some of these tips . <p> Hi Kate ! I just started following your blog ! I am new to the blogging world but I refinish thrift pieces too and love to see your inspiring pieces ! I just got an Ikea Expedit bookshelf for our playroom . It fits into a perfect niche in our wall so it mimics the look of a built-in . I have divided all of my sons toys into sea grass bins on the bottom rows and then stylized the top with coastal elements , stacked hard cover books and textured baskets . It really helps find a balance between playroom and living room ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration and advice on how to style a bookcase . Now I need to find a bookcase to accessorize , maybe I will be as lucky as I was over the weekend when I fould my antique fan and tobacco basket . Stop by and see my finds if you get a chance <p> Great ideas on styling bookcases ! My husband and I built bookcases earlier this year to separate our master bedroom &amp; sitting area/office . It was a bit overwhelming to tackle floor to ceiling bookcases ( 35 cubbies to decorate ) , but I had been collecting items for years from our travels &amp; flea market finds along with a ton of books that I 've read over the years . It took two days and the help of my mother , but I love my bookcases . If you decorate with items that you love , the end result will be better ( and having a mom or friend help is great too ! ) <p> Great post , Kate ! Styling bookshelves is definitely an art , but I like that you 've shown that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me out next time I give styling a bookcase a whirl ! <p> Thanks so much for posting ! I just got floor-to-ceiling shelves on one wall in my dining room . They are white with a beautiful blue-gray paint on the wall showing through . Mine are actually for my books , but I still want them to look nice . I have included art and objects as well , but I love the 7-stacked shelves and will be trying some of those ideas . <p> I have so many books that there is absolutely no room for all the decorative stuff . I LOVE my books . And I do not arrange them by color which I always thought was pretty but dumb . How do you find anything ! And I do not stack my books b/c that takes up more room and it is much harder to pull one out . Ca n't books just stand on their own b/c they are wonderful and inspiring and filled with knowledge and information and can transport you to another world . Books are so much more then any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books anyday . Cat <p> OMG , first your cheese post and now this bookcase post ! I have this extra Billy bookcase hanging around and have been contemplating what to do with it and how to make it look its best and here is THE PERFECT post with so many cool ideas ! ! Thank you .. your timing couldnt be more perfect : ) <p> I love this post . It makes me feel better about my bookshelves , from IKEA that I added black and cream chevron fabric to- and maybe I need to put less on them- but I tried to follow " Nates advice " anyway- there may be a few recent pics on my blog . It is the only wall feature in the room . Thanks for sharing all these great tips ! I love it and appreciate it ! <p> Thanks for the mention Kate ! I wanted to mention so people do n't  get discouraged that it took me MONTHS to get my bookcase looking how it does . And trust me . My bookcase is packed with books ! Theyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one shelf , research/resources on another , David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs get an entire shelf to themselves , LOL etc. etc ) So you can have a loaded bookshelf that 's organized ! Having said that , I 've been wanting to colour ( color ) block my shelves for about a year now . Just for fun ! When I have a spare 18 hours , I might just do it . <p> Oh how I would love to see one of these bookcase styles in my home ! Unfortunately my husband and I have WAY too many books . No matter how many purges we go through our bookcases are always full . Though I have gotten away with displaying small decorative items on the shelf space in front of some books I do n't  think well ever have that less crowded bookcase look . : - ) I ended up getting a cute decorative display case for all my treasures from around the world . That way I get to enjoy them and my husband does n't  get cranky about his book space ( one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I had to read all the comments to see if anyone felt like me , that a styled bookcase is great AS LONG AS you can still easily find and access all the books ! Glad to see that I 'm not alone in this regard . As beautiful as I think Emily Hendersons shelves are , there is no way those books are meant to be taken off of them to be looked at , lol . Maybe you can have some shelves that are for looks only , and some that are for using ? <p> I liked seeing the different ways people use their bookshelves for styling . If I had my own library room , I 'd probably use the rest of the shelves in the house for " pretties . " I 've weeded out a lot of books I do n't  need/read and donated them or handed off to the used bookstore , but I still have a LOT of books . So , my bookshelves ( and a box in the attic ) are currently stuffed with books . Someday , maybe I 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect timing . I have some ledges above my couch that I can borrow these ideas for . I just started from scratch to completely restyle them . It was becoming a hodgepodge of things I would just throw on there without thinking . I was going to update with pictures today , but maybe I 'll wait til I get home to use these ideas ! <p> There are some gorgeous display ideas here . Sadly my bookcases are too crammed with books for there to be much artistic styling going on . I think some of these photos are more instructive in art/collectible display as opposed to bookcases but they are still beautiful . <p> I love a good bookshelf , but I like when they are done out of non-bookshelf materials . I just made one for near my couch using crates . LONG ... Its amazing what a difference it made to the space and I was able to recreate the look for under 50 dollars ! I love the photos you included , it makes me want to go update another bookshelf and put all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the den , two in our bedroom , one in baby boys room , and one in the loft . each one is full of books and other items . i love styling cases and have helped a friend or two as well . all of your ideas are great.and the pictures are helpful . just remember balance as you work , but do n't  forget that not many things are " wrong " on a book case.colors can mix and styles too . it adds to the pleasure of the eye . many people think , " oh that would n't look good on a book case " ; but you 'd be surprised what you can put in a grouping of on top of a stack of layered books . we also enjoy turning some around for that yellow and white page effect ala PBs shelves . <p> Awesome awesome AWESOME post ! I always have such a hard time arranging my shelves all over the house in ways that I actually LOVE them and not to where I am just semi-pleased with them . I cant wait to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! I am seeing all my " junk " in a whole new " shelf-arranging " light ! Thanks Kate for giving us all these great tips and great sources ! : ) You rock ! <p> This is a wonderful post , but I have issues with bookcases being all perfect and matchy because , really , they are for books . They are to be useful . If I had only cream colored books or whatever in mine , then where would my unmatching books all go ? I do n't  want to just look at the bookcase like it is a piece of art , you know ? <p> I 'm with the utilitarians on this one . While all the pictures are gorgeous and interesting , I need my shelves to hold things . I 've already pared my books down as much as I dare its like getting rid of old friends and I come back to almost all of them at various points throughout the year . So the million book question is : what do you do when you need your shelves to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited and you do n't  have scads of square footage ? I also want to send the message to my children about the importance of reading and books , so this is n't just a storage issue . <p> In regards to everyones questions regarding storing books rather than displaying items , the solution is baskets ! Line your shelves with baskets and fill with books with the spine facing down , so that when you pull out the basket you can easily find your books . <p> I love this post . I can say that the bookshelf is the one place in my room that I 'm completely stumped on . AND the bad thing about it is I have a huge built-in in my living room that is screaming for attention . It is the biggest and ugliest mess in one of the most meaningful places in our house . Thank you for these pics . I have ideas running all through my head . Hopefully I can use them to create a more welcoming atmosphere in my home . <p> thank you for this post ! styling bookshelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is keeping my 2 year old away from it , got any solutions for that ? anyway , I would love to see a post too on mantels , I have a very long mantel with a painting hung over it and I have the biggest problem coming up with things to put on it that do n't  compete with the painting , the vaulted ceiling does n't  make it any easier either <p> Thanks for this ! ! I always find it hard to have a bookshelf in the house , as my hubby thinks its ALL for books ! So it ends up looking like a tornado went through it , housing everything from his video games to board games to 10-year old college textbooks ! I finally had to move ours downstairs to get away from the disaster , but now I 'm missing the extra storage it offeredmaybe I could make it look pretty again , but still actually keep " his " junk off of it ! ! <p> This is such a great post . Thank you Kate ! Gives me lots of ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers " . Hope you might have some ideas . They have a a bookcase like area most of the time , well as least mine does . I have glass doors on mine and I have some crystal vases in there and stuff that we were given for our wedding . I do n't  have anywhere else to put it , but I HATE how it looks . Any ideas for making it look nicer ? Could I place cheaper things in with the crystal like books an other decor to finish off the area ? This is the one place in my house that I 'm at a loss . Thanks Kate ! Love your blog . Always have such great inspiration . <p> These are all fantastic examples of bookshelf styling . I have to say that I love reading and love books so my bookshelves are practical and I do n't  love having heaps of little things all over , but a few carefully placed vases and sculpture , and having some books stacked , creates a practical and good looking shelf . Thanks for this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions for decorating and styling my bookshelf . The bookshelf is the main reason we chose this house . Finally , after 2 years someone has wrote about this topic . Thanks so much ! I still feel overwhelmed by the whole thing . I will definitly check out the references at the end of your post . Thanks again ! <p> Wonderful article we have taken a number of these approaches to different bookcases throughout our NorCal home . Books by color is the choice du jour in the office right now thinking of removing all of the covers for a different look soon . <p> I ALWAYS have trouble with the huge bookcases that flank the fireplace in my living room . I think I definitely want to tackle backing them in something graphic . But I have n't decided if I want to paint or use fabric/wallpaper . Well see ! Thanks for sharing these great tips ! <p> Thank you ! My hubby just built some amazing built-ins with tons of storage . but I was a little lost with how I would style them ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with what I 'm needing to learn at that time . Amazing ! <p> @Julianne : If you choose the fabric/wallpaper route , take this tip I picked up from The Thrifty Decor Chick use cheap foam core board ( you can find at some dollar stores ) to back each shelf with , and then wrap the foam core board with your fabric or wallpaper choice . Hardest part is cutting the foam core board ( which is n't that hard ) . It looks great , its easy , AND you can easily change it out . <p> Oh , my word . I love this post thank you so much ! I 'm afraid of clutter , and when it came to styling our media wall ( which you featured , talk about a happy day ! ) , I was totally scared . I did n't  know what to do . I actually had that Lonny image and Sherry and Johns photo for inspiration . Heres what I came up with : <p> My bookshelves bother me because I wish they were more stylish like this . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right now we HAVE to only have books on them . Also , not sure my husband would let me paper the backs <p> such a great roundup of beautiful bookcases. my only regret with owning over 500 books is that i do n't  have the space to display them artfully though i 'm slowly reorganizing and making room by moving books to other rooms . <p> I will anxiously await seeing what you will do to decorate your beautiful built in ! Wow ! That is amazing that you did that with pre fab bookcases ! Lucky you that it fit together so nicely ! I have a wall unit in my living room that will be the death of me yet ! I have quite a few pieces of Polish crystal that are special to me , but no matter how I try to arrange them , they just seem like they are being stored on the shelves , and not really displayed to there best advantage . One thing I am thinking about now is possibly incorporating some books ( what a novel idea ! ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevate the various pieces . My problem is , we are not a big book collector family , so where to find books is a challenge . Love the look of bookcovers- will have to check out goodwill for some generic books , then work on covering them . but the problem will STILL be how to stage them ! I need help ! <p> This is just what I needed ! I 'm a little too OCD with bookcases , " books . must . all . line . up . in. the . same . direction .

@@99057961 @3257961/ <h> Mosaic Tile Window Box Planter <p> By Kate Riley May 7 , 2012 <p> Hey there , hope you had a great weekend ! We did some organizing and gardening and had a big birthday party for both the kids at the local park it was a lot of fun and also relaxing too ! I can feel summer coming with the warmer weather and everything in bloom , and we 're loving spending more time outdoors in the sunshine , are n't you ? <p> Last week I mentioned I came up with a few creative ideas for container gardening for a Home Depot workshop , the first was the wood shim planter , the second was this mosaic tile window planter box seen below . I 've got a third project to share with you later this month , but before I do , here 's an example of how you can use mosaic tile to dress up an ordinary redwood planter . <p> Any small scale mosaic tile you find will do and there are so many available to choose from . This project can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you stick to the mesh grid square mosaics like the one seen above instead of an offset or brick pattern tile . I chose white because the planter was destined to be part of a raffle at the Home Depot presentation and because basic white would be at home in any backyard . <p> If you 've never tiled anything before , this is a good place to start ! It 's a small enough project for you to get your feet wet with a tiling , and you 'll be so excited you did it ! To recreate your own mosaic tile planter , here are the basic supplies : wood planter box , thin set mortar , mosaic tile of choice , grout , stain or outdoor latex paint ( optional ) , polyurethane ( if staining ) , sponge brush , large sponge , grout float or spackle/putty knife , and painter 's tape . <p> Since I was working with white tile I wanted to make is stand out with a dark contrast so I stained the top and bottom wood trim which would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which removed the reddish tones and deepened the wood to a darker espresso stained finish . <p> Use a sponge brush to apply one ( or two ) coats to achieve the color you 're looking for . You could also paint the trim too , but be sure to prime first with a stain blocking primer . <p> To adhere the tile to the wood , you need a thin set mortar , I chose the one below since it came in a smaller box , but you can use any that will work with the tile you 've chosen , be sure to read the label . <p> Apply the mortar to the sides of your window box , I used a wide putty knife to apply it . <p> Next , trim your mosaic tile to fit and set it in the mortar . Be sure to check your tile measurements first since tile varies in size to make sure your tile will fit the length and width of the planter box . It 's okay to have small gaps above or off to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's a view from the side , you can see there is a small gap above the mosaic tile and also along the sides , but that gets filled with grout later so no worries ! <p> Allow the mortar to dry for 24 hours , then mix your grout as directed and use a grout float or other tool ( I used a putty knife ! ) to fill with grout in between the tiles . Taping off your stained or painted trim helps , since grouting can get a little sloppy . <p> With a sponge , gently wipe away any excess grout from the surface of the tile , and allow to dry for another 24 hours . That 's it ! <p> If you 've stained your trim , you can give it a coat of polyurethane to protect it . After your efforts , you 'll have a beautifully tiled planter box ! <p> With this same process , you can choose any tile in any color you like , or even choose paint instead of stain for the trim here are two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other with painted trim and blue glass tile . The possibilities are endless ! <p> This project makes a great gift , but if you create one for yourself , it will certainly be a beautiful focal point and conversation piece in your yard ! <p> The Look What I Planted ' Link Party starts tomorrow morning at 6 a.m . PST , link up all your garden ideas , see you then ! <p> Gorgeous Kate , just gorgeous ! ! ! I love it . I would love to try something like this one day . But I have way too many projects on my to-do list right now , so it will have to get added to my " maybe in the future " to-do list . ; ) <p> Great ideaand looks fantastic ! This is definitely the time of year to be sprucing up the yardand this project adds a ton of style and interest to a plain planter box . Love it ! Sorry I missed your visit to the Roseville Home Depot . I used to live up that waylooking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your creative and inspiring projectsthanks for sharing ! <p> I love the white tile on the planter and it looks like a very expensive piece once it is finished . So did you make one for yourself to keep or only one to give away . It is so pretty I would have had to have made one for me to keep . <p> This is a cool project ! But , I have a question about durability . Wont moisture be a problem ? I thought tile substrate , in general , cant move at all ( which is why we use concrete board for floors and walls instead of wood ) . I would be concerned about grout cracking/tile popping . Did you line your planter with something waterproof ? Can this be left out in the rain ? <p> Love this tiled planter Kate ! We have some new neighbors . I think I 'll try my hand at this planter and give it to them as a welcome to the neighborhood gift . Might need to make two.one for myself , too . <p> I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robins egg blue jewels I got on line that I used to refinished the cement birdbath . I think I 'll make a planter to match . How does it stay on the wood . I 've always thought the wood shrinks and swells so it wont support the thin-set over time . Did you find a secret ? ? Please share . <p> Hi Helen , yes its true wood can shrink and expand , it definitely depends on the climate ! We do n't  experience it much here , but it can happen . With such a small project and one that can be pulled indoors in wet weather , the tile should be fine , but for a larger project that will sit outside and through rainy seasons , there should be some backerboard to stabilize the tile over the years . Thats what 's used in high moisture areas . Kate <p> The planter is beautiful ! Im surprised you did n't  have to seal the wood.I tried a mosaic on a round wood table top using a box of broken Vietri chinait came out beautiful and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warped ! I cried my eyes out but there was no fixing it .. I was told it was because I did n't  seal the wood and it absorbed too much moisture . Anyway , so glad it worked for you ! <p> THanks Kate for the Info I live in Minnesota so the backer board is a must . I 'm thinking that the Big Guy can make a planter with backboard and we can line it . Thanks for the great idea as usual . I can see it now . <p> DO you know if it would work with Plastic planters ? I have 2 enormous ones that I want to change-up .. You read my mind ! Every time I do a google search of a project , " Centsational girl " has done it for me whoo ! <p> I jut made one of these planters as a gift for Mothers Day using your instructions . I could n't believe how easy it was ! The box I used was 12 x 24 x 12 ( found at Lowes ) , cost $46 and 4 sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up perfectly with a box this size .

Do you have a favorite online fabric source ? Any great Etsy shops or textile suppliers that sell online ? Feel free to add them in the comments ! <h> 99 comments <p> I just thought I would mention a couple of things to be aware of when ordering fabric . <p> Make sure you specify to the vendor that it is packaged in plastic so it does n't  get wet/dirty . I 've had to return fabric because of this issue . <p> Also , if ordering fabric for drapery panels , make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had over 6 yards shipped from Tonic Living all folded up &amp; creased up . When I called them , they said you have to request it if you want it shipped on a roll .

Too many to name . Sometimes , there is only one yard of a several hundred dollar per yard fabric that goes for ten dollars , if you are the only one bidding !

@@99057970 @3257970/ <h> DIY : Invisible Trellis <p> By Kate Riley July 8 , 2009 <p> When we began our remodel in 2005 , it required that we dramatically grade our rear yard to accommodate for the extension of the home. - Our rear yard has an uphill slope. - After all the tractors departed , I was left with a gigantic six foot eyesore of a retaining wall. - The only way to cover it was with clever plantings . <p> In the spring of 2008 , I started the landscaping process by making my own invisible trellis to hide the wall. - An invisible trellis is an inexpensive way to train a vine up a wall without the expenditure and installation of wood lattice or a metal trellis . <p> Here 's a look at my version up close : <p> An invisible trellis is very easy to install , and virtually maintenance free. - The only tools you need are a drill for pilot holes , wire cutters , and a measuring tape. - The only supplies you 'll need are screw eyes and galvanized steel wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your trellis on your wall or fence. - I used a pencil to mark off the location for the screw eyes along the upper diagonal of my wall , then created a vertical and horizontal grid 12 inches apart. - The second step is to drill pilot holes where you 've marked the location for your screw eyes. - Once all of your screw eyes are installed , simply connect the eyes with your galvanized wire to form the trellis . <p> The invisible trellis virtually disappears on the wall , and allows the beautiful vine to put on a show. - And here is the wall after installing the invisible trellis , a citrus tree , and some shrubs. - It 's amazing how greenery can turn something functional into something lovely . <p> Last summer , I planted two pink bower vines , a type of jasmine. - In summer , my bower vines give me pink trumpet shaped blooms with dark pink throats. - The added bonus is that the plant is an evergreen , so it stays green all winter long , hiding my wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha on installing an invisible trellis , look here . <p> It looks great ! Question : It looks like you used stucco or plaster first over the block walls . Is that right ? We are trying to figure out what to do with our standard builder-issued cinderblock walls . Hubby wants them lighter so they wo n't kill our garden in the Phoenix heat . Any how-to 's about the wall are greatly appreciated . I think we may do your trellis idea ( I 'm all about cheap ) , but that will take a while to get going , I 'm afraid , and the plants are dying now . <p> Wow , what a beautiful garden .

@@99057972 @3257972/ <h> Artist Canvas turned Inspiration Board <p> By Kate Riley November 9 , 2010 <p> Memo boards are just one of lifes necessities , at least for me . I have a giant custom memo board that I built earlier this year for the mud room , that one is for all the *stuff* I need to remind myself when I take the kids off to school or head out the door . Mail , Netflix movies , birthday party invitations , coupons , etc . <p> In my office , I needed something different , something just for me ! A spot to post calendars , mementos , postcards , kid art , fabric swatches , photographs , all my little treasures . A place for those nostalgic keepsakes that I want to keep on display , not just to remind me of moments and memories , but also to inspire . <p> I 've wanted a gigantic board for awhile now , and preferred the look of fabric over a cork board . I considered building another one with plywood , but did n't  like the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive big ol nails into my grasscloth wallpaper , no no no thank you ! Then I spied a giant 48 " x 48 " artist canvas for half price at Michaels and decided to use that instead it was lightweight and the perfect size . Unfortunately , an artist canvas does n't  hold thumbtacks very well on its own , so I decided to reinforce it with some cork roll along the back . <p> Its kinda like wallpapering . . . you apply plenty of glue then smooth out the cork roll along the back of the canvas . <p> Work in sections , moving from top to bottom . To hold the cork down on your glue , grab a bunch of cans of paint and let them sit for about 30 minutes per section . <p> When your glue is dry , wrap your canvas in your fabric of choice . I like linen , so I went with that , plus in was on the summer sale rack . I also glued on a ribbon border for a little extra detail . As a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the perimeter to secure it to the edges . <p> Over time , I 'll be adding all sorts of favorite things , both new and old . For now , I 'm loving the size and potential . Call it organized chaos , or contained clutter , but personally , I see it as a place to keep everything that 's special to me . <p> Have you ever made a memo or inspiration board for yourself ? Where do you keep all your little reminders of favorite things in life ? <p> Thank you ! I have been trying to figure out a low cost way to make a cork board that looked different than justcork . I was thinking about magnetic paint , but I 've heard meh results . How thick was the cork and where did you get the long sheets ? I 've only seen the 8.5 x 11 craft sheets at michaels . Maybe I missed it . <p> So funny ! Its like you 're in my head ! I wanted to turn one of my many under-utilized canvas boards into an inspiration board but thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cork BEHIND the canvas ? hello ! I did n't  even consider it ! Genius = ) <p> Thanks for the tip . It officially made my life easier Inspiration board here I come ! <p> I bought a couple of 18 x 24 corkboards , covered them in some leftover fabric that I got from Ikea to cover a couple of canvases burnt orange with a visible weave , and mounted them side by side with Command mounting strips ( the velcro like ones ) which I stapled to the back of the boards they are light enough to work just do n't  like sticking to the fabric . SO no nail holes . They sit butted up against another above my little desk in the corner of the family room . great for School stuff , bills , church notes and my favourite Keep Calm and Carry On sign . <p> One thing about artist canvas I embroider on it and once you make a hole in it somewhere , that hole wont " heal " like it will on cork . I know you have the cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you re-thumbtack a lot , you may find the canvas does n't  help grip the tack anymore . That may be a non-issue if you do n't  change out stuff on your board a lot , but I thought I 'd throw that out there . <p> That said , I *really* like this idea and have my thinking cap on to come up with a way to modify it so that I could change stuff out often without using tacks . Thanks for sharing your creativity ! <p> Oh I really love what you did . The accent around the edges is great . I have the same LOVE print from MadeByGirl ( : I 've made a few boards like this . I reupholstered the bulletin board above my desk at home with a fun coordinating fabric . I also just made 7 cork board squares with the names of the days of the weeks and a cute ribbon on them to put above my desk at school so I can stay organized ( : <p> Love your idea . I have an idea board in my bedroom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yours , but it has a large wooden frame around the outside . Decopauge was kind of big when I was in college , so I got tons of retro style paper and did some fun designs . I LOVED doing it , and I still LOVE the board today . Just found your blog super excited to follow it . THANKS ! <p> Love this ! It turned out perfectly ! I read the comment about using thumb tac in the same spot over &amp; over Probably no biggie because of the cork backing , and maybe use pins instead ? ( As they are a bit thinner . ) Thanks for posting ! Really great project ! <p> I have one that I made for my laundry room it is covered with photos of the people I love .. I love looking at it when I am doing laundry .. which is ALWAYS ! I love the ribbon border around yours looks great above your new storage table ! <p> Looks amazing ! Love the linen with the ribbon trim . I made one starting with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hmmm . I think I like your solution better . You will have to let me know how it holds up . <p> Beautiful board . Love the ribbon around the edge . My mom gave me a similar board for my office . I hang all of my favorite greeting cards from family and friends . It gives me a emotional lift when I look at it reminds me of all those I love ( and those who love me ) . <p> Instead of using a traditional cork or fabric board , I picked up an old metal garden gate from a local antique store , spray painted it and hung it on the wall with big pipe brackets . I clip photos , kids artwork , magazine tear-outs and other inspiring items to it with wooden clothes pins . I 've also added some metal hooks ( recycled from an old pot rack ) along the bottom , and hang buckets , baskets , etc. , for extra storage in my craft room . I love that its salvaged and re-purposed , but mostly , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visual person I love to see the things that inspire me or just make me smile . I have them all up on one wall in my studioffice . I edit it every once and a while , but still have some items on it that date back to my childhood and college days . The wall is such a nice reminder of times gone by , things I have done , and an inspiration of what I would still like to accomplish in my life . My best- Diane <p> Very nice , Kate ! The ribbon is a fun touch . I also see some pretty fabrics tacked up . Ca n't wait to see what you do with those ! I have been wanting a memo board so may try try out your idea . Thanks for sharing your tutorial . <p> Talk about timing ! I have a canvas that I set aside for memo board purposes but have n't gotten around to making it yet . I was going to go in more of the French-style but I love the idea of using cork board ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if I could put something quite like this together , but I have space over my new office desk for an inspiration board and I would love to put something up to keep me smiling and motivated during the day . <p> This is wonderful ! I have an inspiration board right in my lounge ( living room ) and have a ball redecorating it every month . I put my scarves , artwork , pretty letters , even random stuff I have found laying around . <p> I built a wooden frame out of molding and stapled builders mesh to the back . I spray painted the whole thing white and clip my things on with big chunky silver clips . Some of these clips are antique and some are new but I love them all ! <p> Oh , i have one of those ( smaller version ) for my earrings and necklaces . Its a really great idea and yours came out superpretty = ) think I 'm going to make some space on the walls in my room for a inspiration board . <p> Love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add vinyl lettering to the fabric . It just so happens that I have all three : a canvas , a roll of cork , and vinyl lettering ! Thanks for the great idea ! FUN FUN FUN ! <p> I use the artist canvasses to make memo boards . I just staple the fabric , batting and ribbon right onto the wood frame in the back , hand sew the buttons where the ribbons cross and cover the back with felt &amp; attach picture hangars ! This makes any sized memo boards in any fabric and boards that are all framed in for you and are lightweight . <p> I love this ! ! I finally have my own Mom Cave room in our new house and I am looking for inspiring ideas on decorating it . This is a must-have for that room . Thanks for the great idea and tutorial . You never cease to inspire . : - ) <p> I have made my own memo board but it is very small . I use it in my kitchen and orginally made it to hold my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for announcements and pictures that are sent in the mail . After the event is over , I remove it from the board . <p> What a fantastic idea . I hate the cork-board look myself as it usually is pigeon-holed as a reminder board but with your idea it can be anything you want which is so appropriate with using an artists blank canvas as a base . <p> Love your site getting many ideas , one being this inspiration board . I found , and used on my first board , cork drawer liner ( contact paper ) . But I noticed yours is just a roll of cork , which would probably work better as the contact paper has that layer of thickish tack stuff . Sowhere did you find this cork ? 23102 @qwx883102

We 're loving the sleek modern look of the new shelves along the wall in the study . I did some research online and found a few ideas for even more alternatives to this versatile piece , with product suggestions for transforming them yourself , here ya go ! <p> Spray paint a set for a bright bold statement to add a punch of color to a plain wall . I can see them in all the colors : cherry red , Kelly green , peacock blue , so fun ! <p> shelving image via Better Homes &amp; Gardens <p> Industrial chic is all the rage , and the nesting tables can transform with some gray primer and stained wood planks . For a look less painted and more like metal , check out Freckled Laundry 's faux zinc tutorial . <p> Perhaps a glam version of the nesting tables ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror from a local glass shop .

@@99057982 @3257982/ <h> Let 's Talk Moisturizer <p> By Kate Riley January 24 , 2013 <p> Well my friends today I 'm at the ALT Design Summit Conference in Salt Lake City as a first time attendee and so far the experience has been great . Im excited to meet and make new friends and contacts while I 'm in town . My sister also relocated here last year so I get a chance to celebrate her birthday with her this weekend . She warned me before I came to town , " this is not California , this is a mountain climate , and it is cold ! Bring your warmest jacket , drink lots of water , and remember to moisturize ! " <p> I hate to say the words ( plug your ears sis ) but my sister was totally right . My skin already feels very dry but I 'm also in denial about a little thing called the aging process . : ) Ill let you in on a little secret . I 'm turning forty this year , yes me , forty ! It always reminds me of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her meltdown and when she says through tears " But I 'm going to be forty.someday ! " <p> It 's taken me a few years to settle on the moisturizers I like best and my favorites vary by day and by season . Spring and summer I 'm focused on sunscreen and in winter or dry climates like this one , its all about extra moisture . Here are my faves : <p> For nighttime : Mario Badescu Caviar Night Cream thick and creamy and wonderful , I love this one at night before I go to bed . It reminds me of Cr+me de la Mer , but much more affordable , I 've been using this for over a year . <p> For pep : I love love love Ole Henricksons Sheer Transformation , its lightweight and silky and perfect for right out of the shower and in summertime too . <p> For eyes : Mario Badescu Chamomile Eye Cream ( anti aging , for nighttime ) and Origins GinZing for puffiness or dark circles during the day . <h> 35 comments <p> So sorry that you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have been here about a year and a half , and we really love it ( when its not like this ) . I would say " make sure you at least take a drive-around tour of Sugarhouse , the Aves , and Federal Heights , " but the weather is so crummy , I do n't  know how much of the beautiful old houses you can even see ( not to mention the icy road conditions ) . Hope you get the time to come back sometime when its beautiful ! <p> Hello there ! I have to tell you that I have never used these products . I use day and night creams that are based on olive oil and aloe vera , while for the eyes I need something stronger , that 's why I use an anti-wrinkle eye cream from Oriflame . I think that the most important for a healthy skin is the daily cleaning and we have to find the right soap for our type of skin . Interesting article ! <p> Thanks for these suggestions Kate ! I 'm always looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . living through Midwest winters ! I always forget about Mario B , although I keep hearing good things ( I hear Martha is a fan too ) . Got ta try the Caviar Cream ! <p> I keep it pretty simple . For the face , I use Oil of Olay Regenerist along with Garnier BB Cream . The face wash I use is Neutrogena Cream Cleanser . For the lips , I 'm hooked on Cococare Cocoa Butter Lip Balm . For the body , Curel its great for dry skin . Will have to try the Mario B and Caviar Cream sounds luxurious ! <p> I have very dry skin so I am always on the hunt for a good moisturizer and have tried more than I like to admit . I am kind of a product junky ! I use Creme De La Mer for years , but now that I am no longer working I needed to find an alternative with a better price . I have found some wonderful products from France . They are imported by an USA distributor and I am in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . They are affective and affordable . I did a post on my tried and true , skin care products LONG ... <p> I adore Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme for day or night . And I can get it at the grocery store for under $13 ! Eucerin also makes this as a lotion with SPF , but I 'm allergic to chemical sunscreens otherwise I 'd try that too . <p> I am a firm believer in using mineral makeup and vitamin E oil on my skin . I really appreciate you sharing this because I fell as i get older I need to get wiser about taking care of my dry skin . Thanks ! <p> I have very dry skin . I have been using Josie Maran makeup , Argan oil and whipped body butter for about six month now , and I doubt I 'll EVER change . Its the first thing Ive ever used that actually made my skin better for hours , not just minutes , and her foundation actually makes my skin better , not dry , cakey or OLD . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her website . I highly , highly recommend it for dry skin . Its fabulous . <p> Ive been using Rodan + Fields ( from the same doctors who created Proactiv ) for over 6 months now , and my skin has never felt so soft ! I loved it so much that I decided to start my own business around it . I use the Unblemish line ( to combat my adult acne ) and include many of the anti-aging products to prevent wrinkles . Love , love , love it all . <p> I have very dry , sensitive skin , even though I live in a hot , humid climate . I swear by the moisturizers from Paulas Choice ( my fave is Skin Recovery ) ! Extremely emollient and reasonably priced . I do n't  use the line exclusively , as there are some products that irritate my sensitive skin , but the majority of products in my regimen comes from this line . I saw her on Oprah years ago and have been a fan ever since . You can find it at //www.cosmeticscop.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup products . I 'm also a fan of sweet almond oil for the body and face . <p> I love Dr Denese antiaging products , esp her retinoid serum , the only one I 've found that does n't  eat my skin . I use her facial cleanser on my body in the shower during winter . Because my skin just " aged up " a notch , I have n't yet found makeup that works for me . Ive been wishing Laura Mercier did n't  have SPF which I ca n't use in chemical form . And PS ! Im waaay past 40 it happens to the best of us ( not Lol ) because I just had another b-day yesterday . Oy ! <p> Thanks for the round up of great products Kate ! I am horrible about the way I take care of my skin , thank God I do n't  lay out in the sun like so many of my fellow Floridians but I still have a lot of exposure to it and I am sad to admit .. I do n't  wear ANY moisturizer . When I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really do n't  . That Sheer Transformations seems my style.something super light . Maybe I 'll give it a try ! thanks for sharing ! <p> I LOVE the Equate ( found at Wal Mart ) version of Oil of Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin . It has SPF ( 30 I think ) , its lightweight , its never greasy , it absorbs really , really well , and it does not irritate my skin and its dirt cheap ! I buy it by the truckload from Mal Mart.com since its usually sold out when I go to look for it in the store . I kid you not , this stuff ROCKS ! I have used this for a good 15 years and I would never think of using anything else . I 'm in my 40s but my skin is still pretty oily so I do n't  need a heavy duty moisturizer . I live in Southern California so it gets dry here . If they ever stop making this , I will CRY . Note : The Equate version is so much better than the name brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the name brand version irritates my skin , where Equate does not . I have oily , mature , fair , sensitive , rosacea prone skin . <p> I 'm a lot older probably than most of your readers . I just turned the big " 6-0 ! " Yikes ! But thankfully , my skin has always been more oil and now it is a good normal/combo so dryness is n't always my issue , especially if I stay hydrated . Ive used everything from high end to drug store but lately I 've tried more natural and green cosmetics . Right now I am using some products from The Vital Image that I discovered in Santa Barbara for that big birthday celebration during a wonderful spa day that my hubby treated me to . I have large pores and using their products has really made a huge difference in that area . I also have discovered the benefits of using virgin coconut oil . I was breaking out on my chin area and decided to try the antimicrobial benefits . After using dermatologist products to no avail , I experimented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially in the area of my breakouts and the next morning I was amazed to find the breakouts were totally gone and my face felt like velvetas well as my hands and feet ! <p> I am a faithful user of the Laura Mercer tinted moisturizer . I love that it helps even out my face . Even if I 'm in a rush in the morning , I at least make the effort to apply this before leaving the house . <p> Hi Kate , I have been using Serious Skin Care by Jennifer Stallone for over a year . I use the vitamin C version and love it . My skin has never been so balanced in hot weather or winter weather . The first winter I did n't  have all the flakiness to fight . On turning forty , I had one friend tell me " Its only a number " and that was right ! Everytime I started to feel a little panic , I just repeated " its only a number " and it helped . <p> Just had to say that I just started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combo/ acne prone skin at 40(ugh) and this line seems to have just the products . Mositurizer is absolutely necessary once ya fall off the 39 mark ; ) <p> I am 32 and like Aveeno and Garnier Fructis moisturizers . They are affordable and work great for me . What has worked best is using Clniques clarifying lotion ( #2 ) and then moisturizing . THey werent lying about exfoliating being the best thing for soft , smooth skin . <p> Kudos from me to Paulas Choice products . Her website , //www.cosmeticscop.com is outstanding . It has a lot of good scientific information about skin care . If you click on the Beautypedia Reviews tab , you can see her ratings system for many , many makeup and skin care companies along with their contact information and the scientific research to back her up . Over the years , Paula has saved me a boatload of money by helping me to realize that I do n't  have to go anywhere else but the local drug store to buy whatever I need . She often suggests alternatives to pricey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not work for Paula , but I have a lot of respect for her and her opinions because she backs them up with facts . Yes , she does sell her own products , but as you will see , she thoroughly and fairly rates other products and is n't afraid to tell you when something is " beautifully formulated . " Seriously , please do n't  believe me ! Please at least give her website a look-see ! ! <p> Okay , down from my soapbox and back to the blogosphere . Thank you to everyone for sharing ! ! <p> WHAT . You are not going to be 40 this year . Er ma gerd . I want to look like you when I 'm 40 . <p> As for moisturizers , I 've tried a bunch of samples from Sephora ( Ole Henriksen included ) and finally settled on THE ONE : Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer its ah-mah-zing . It does n't  feel greasy , and not only does it make your skin feel healthy and glowy , even the next morning , your skin just feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when the temps get below zero ) it is a must to have some thick stuff on . I 've had facials at Mario Badescus salon in New York City ( best deal going in city you have to check it out ) but havent tried the cavier ! Will do next time . Also wanted to go to the Alt Summit next year ! Thanks again for the info ! : ) <p> I was in Deer Valley Utah this summer and I had a hard time with the altitude and the dry skin was a persistent problem . I am a huge mario badesco fan Laura Mercier is killer too . I just turned 45 and it was hard but what makes it easier is really taking good care of myself , moisturizing , smiling a lot , eating right , exercising , good genes help too but thinking and acting youthful looks youthful.Love your blog. xoxo 23102 @qwx883102

Love the examples you 've shown and would love to have a metallic finished piece in my own home . The Little Green Notebooks nightstands are fabulous ! <p> I think one piece could be perfection , but a roomful would start to look like Donald Trumps apartment . ; ) I liked the side table and a few of the nightstands .

I 'm totally in awe of that b/c silver leafing is not easy nor could I even get a square inch to be so silky and smooth as she did over the entire piece . <p> yes I am loving these finishes . I really want to redo my china cabinet with a pewter finish . Its like another neutral but with a pow ! I want to silver leaf ( or maybe paint metallic , not sure yet how lazy I will end up feeling ) a large wooden framed mirror that I have i will post the transformation when its done on my blog. thanks for gathering all these great inspiration photos ! <p> I think if done tastefully it can really be a show stopper . My girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated the leafing on the stencil on one wall . Very lightly going over certain parts of the stencil with the leafing . It looks increadible just like wallpaper ! <p> ok ! so I have totally been wanting to try this on a thrift store piece I bought a while back-but soooo afraid it will look " cheap " . Its in my dining room and I have a very large mirror above it that I silver antiqued a few months back . I may need to find a tutorial on this before I move forward . *eeek ! * <p> I was drooling over Jennys transformation too . I have a little buffet in my dining room that would look fantastic with a similar finish , but the doors have caned insets and I 'm not sure how theyll accept paint , so I 'm a little scared to try <p> I love this look .

I never thought about a baby nursery being this flashy but I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are beautiful ! <p> Well this coming from a ADOS person ( Attention Deficit Oh SHINY ) I love a metallic finish . I found 4 gorgeous Henredon dining chairs for $40 on Craiglist and they are currently black with gilt accents I have determined they would be perfect done in pewter so I love it and think it would work fabulously in your house always in limited quantities but with eclat : ) <p> I agree I LOVE little green notebooks nightstand re-do ! It was perfect I love the silver leaf style i think they look best on cuvy furniture ala french style pieaces . Ive been thiking about adding some shimmer and shine to some mirrors for my bedroom . <p> Hi , I 'm an interior deigner and I love to accent a room with a unique piece and love all the metals and mirrored furniture that is in right now . I have the " Silver Leaf dresser , Decorpad " in my bedroom . Its actually the Soliloque Hall Chest from Thomasville . I love it and its the perfect compliment to the other wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style requires some artistic talent when it comes to interior decorating ( which you have in spades ) . You have to know how to place a piece of furniture like this into a room and not have it overpower the room or look out of place or tacky . In rooms like mine , where decorating is still in its infant stages , it would be very out of place until I got all the other components of the room put together . That 's probably why its so hard for most people to take the plunge and add this style ( which they may truly like ) into their living space . I 'd love to do it , but would n't even know where to begin sad for me ! <p> In all honesty , this is really the first time Ive seen this type of thingor at least paid attention to it . I actually like the silver pieces , although I cant picture them working in my house . I 'm sort of anti-gold and brass these days . <p> I love it-some rustoleum specialty metallic paint made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are really pretty- plan to use it for some accent pieces- would not have thought to use it or leafing on a larger piece of furniture . <p> I love the metallics ! They are a neutral , but still with a lot of funk and character that black and brown just cant do . I love seeing gold pieces done right ( because gold can be super tacky or super decadent ) . : o ) <p> What timing . My oldest daughter turned me on to your site ( for towel wraps we will make for her bridesmaids ) and just love your ideas , instructions , etc . Just exploring your site got me out of a funk and while browsing thru Pier 1 , my youngest 10 year old daughter , found a silver/mirrored small vanity dresser she loves . Well she has one in her bedroom I bought a few years ago from Target in the Shabby Chic line and were moving to a different look in her room so were going to try the instructions . Just last night I was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought I would try to use that to silver the vanity but back today and you 've provided the exact steps we need . Ill share pictures when we finish . Thank you ! ! ! ! <p> Thank you for always sharing such gems . I have awarded you a " Kreativ Blogger Award " on my site.no doubt you have already received plentybut I just love your blog and all your tips , I thought you deserved the award ! <p> Love the Wisteria chest you featured , its gorgeous , along with the night stands from Little Green Notebook . I 've actually been eying a lovely mirrored piece , just not sure my other half will go for it <p> I agree with you , if used in the right space it can look very glamorous ! All of these are great , especially the 3rd to last . I like how the mirror and the chair accent each other with the gold metallic , along with all of the other gold accents . -Sarah <p> I too have a slight obsession with anything and everything metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollywood glam style . I repainted all of my furniture white and metallic silver and also several picture frames and a wood tray . I LOVE it ! <p> I love the spray painted side table you posted ! I 'm going to be on the lookout for small tables like that to paint ! <p> Love this look ! I just picked up a vintage dresser that was abandoned at the curb and have to paint it and am trying to decide what to do with it . A shiny silver finish would be so pretty and dramatic . <p> I spray painted a half moon hall table in a beautiful metallic silver and put two different sizes of tiny mirrors approx. 1 ? and 3/4 ? in width spaced around the rim and onto the squared parts , of the three turned legs . IT LOOKS AWSOME ! If I do say so myself . Everyone who has seen it thinks it was a great way to update a boring wee table . Go for the shine ! <p> I am in the process of repainting my French Provencial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it the same effect but I do n't  know where to purchase the paint nor the wherewithal to do so . I have a great handyman who is assisting me . Please help me with any information that you may have . <p> hican anyone help me how to antique silver leaf furniture ? i just covered a big dresser with silver leaf but i did n't  like the finish of it , it looks so unprofessionali think it will look better with antiquing it but i couldnt find any how to videos or blogs abt antiquing silver leaf and it has been sitting in my garage for 2 weeksplz help : ) <p> Thank you , i was looking for ideas . Metallic finishes of furniture is such a good idea . it brightens a room . But I could not find the instructions . i did buy OD at a auto paint supplier , have not painted it yet though , thought i would first do some research . <p> Thanks for sharing this list of metallic furniture- I 'm all over the metallic trend right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed our bronze sunburst mirror into an antique silver finish . It turned out great , was super easy and cheap ! It only required a can of silver metallic spray paint , black spray paint , and a little time . We posted a DIY guide to achieving the look over at our blog . LONG ... I just love how it turned out ! <p> WowI am about two years behind you , but finding your site/blog is the answer to my dreams ! I love metallic finishes and have been buying and using every product I can find to see which I like best . Of course , the new Martha Stewart paints have been very easy . I 'm wondering if the silver leaf nightstands allow the brown base to show through a little . Its hard to tell in the pictures.but I think that would be cool . Also , I am also painting everything white ( again , two years behind you ) . so your blog on white rooms really solidified my opinion that it is timeless ! <p> I too absolutely love metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to it . Now that I think about it , I think I 'm infatuated with all things chrome ! I refinished a bedroom set for a teen in metallic silver , zebra and hot pink . It was one of my favs . <p> I have a beat up small ish dresser we are going to use as an entry table , I am thinking the metallic finish with crystal hardware will go nicely will the grey/taupe walls and beefy white trim . Just a touch of girly in our mostly masculine new home . I found you through pinterest ! Addictive I tell you . <p> I think the hardest thing for me is to find the " right " piece . I have a lot of dark furniture and old pieces , so I do n't  want it to stick out in a way that looks tacky . I think I might re-invent a filing cabinet by replacing handles and removing tag holder . Ca n't decide if I need silver leaf or silver paint . <p> I have always loved the antique/silver leaf/gold leaf/bronzed look on furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm also a huge white fan as my kitchen is sunny , white , and always fresh lookingwhite cabinets , walls and white countertops with an edging of color . I bring in more color with accessories . Love your blog . I do n't  know how you find the time to keep up with it with young children . Kudos to you ! Keep on blogging . <p> Love the metallic influence .. although a little goes a long way unless you are a glamour girl which I am . I have a fabulous mirrored chest in my living room that is a real offset to the industrial style coffee table . Everybody loves it . Thanks for your pictures .. really inspiring . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057986 @3257986/ <h> White Dishes Never Fail <p> By Kate Riley November 22 , 2010 <p> Heather from Chesapeake , Virginia emailed me yesterday with this question : <p> " I was wondering if you could email me or blog about where to buy white dinnerware dishes . I am looking for a set and there are so many on the marketbut I do n't want to spend a huge amount of money ! I saw in your ' Five Fall Savory Soups ' post that you have a nice set . Could you please tell me where you bought them ? I am looking for a durable set on a frugal budget . " <p> Sure Heather ! <p> First , let me say I cant remember the last time I bought a dinnerware set with plates , bowls and mugs . I prefer to buy open stock plates rather than have extra mugs or bowls I wo n't use . Matching basic plates is perfectly fine for everyday , but when it comes to holidays or dinner parties , I say mix up your settings for more visual appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good set of plain white dishes that you can work with on a daily basis , or a basic white dinner plate that you can use when setting a special occasion table . <p> Here are a few choices : <p> I like Crate and Barrels Essential Whiteplates you can purchase by themselves . Six white dinner plates will run you $28 , the salad plates are $4 each . Z Galleries St. Helena dinner plates are on sale for $28 for four , salad plates are four for $24 . <p> If you 're looking for a more modern restaurant style square plate , Walmart has a these Canopy white plates , $13 for four dinner plates . These Cordon Bleurounded edge dinner plates ( $6 each ) and salad plates ( $5 each ) are available at Bed , Bath &amp; Beyond . Also check out their Everyday Whitescollection , you can buy those plates individually as well . <p> Pier One , World Market or Home Goods are also worth a visit ! <p> But to answer your question Heather , the plates you see in my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect white dishes are not too thin , not too thick , they 're just right ! And priced perfectly too : $49 for 12 dinner plates , $39 for 12 salad plates . You cant beat that price for the quality and traditional style . I 've had my sets for almost two years and we eat off of them every single day . <p> One final suggestion is to check your local Goodwill or Salvation Army . Just today , I saw these sets ! <p> Your local thrift stores are always a good place to pop in for inexpensive extra place settings . Every now and then , you get really lucky ! <p> White always works because you can mix it with plates from different collections , or with patterned dishes . A plain white dinner plate makes a perfect backdrop to a decorative salad plate here are a few of my holiday favorites ! <p> World Market has some white plates at a reasonable price &amp; you can buy them individually so you do n't  need to buy the things you wont use . I also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ballards catalog and the price was n't bad at all . If you have a Pfalzgraff outlet nearby , they usually have some great things at reasonable prices too . <p> I have reaaaaalllly cheap white Ikea plates . The most important result of which is that my sons can unload the dishwasher every morning before school , and I do n't  CARE if they chip the plates . Worth it ! ; ) <p> Great post . Even though I love the colors white is the way to go . We spent an entire semester in Culinary School learning the art of plating . " The white plate is to a chef , as a blank white canvas is to the artist " . So not only are you dressing your table but you are framing the glorious food you 've prepared . <p> I am always drawn to white plates , too . I have 4 square , 4 round and 4 with a touch of black . Last year at this time Target had a sale of 12 white plates for $9.99 ! Of course I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house as well , but even for the 2 of us , I almost always use different plates every day . I enjoy your info very much ! <p> We got a huge set at JC Penney for like $100 on clearance a few months ago , they have been used daily and are dishwasher safe and just holding up so well ! They seem to mark things done frequently and usually have a good basic set available . <p> Great tips ! I was thinking about that yesterday when I put out my Nannies old " china " that she gave me b/c she did n't  like it anymore . : s I need to invest in some white dishes that do n't  look like my everyday ones . : ) <p> I could n't agree more . I registered for white everyday dishes as well as white china when I got married and have never regretted the decision . I 've had to replace dishes over the years but found that Pier I and Target are the most affordable/sturdy . I have a variety of salad plates that I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looks for my table . <p> I agree , white plates are great never fail , versatile and expandable . I 've got a vintage set that I adore , and can expand all-but infinitely with my other vintage pieces and/or the plain white backup ones I got at a big box store . <p> If you are needing quite a few place settings . JC Penney has several styles in White/Off White that go on sale frequently for 1/2 offespecially NOW with Thanksgiving and Christmas so close . Last year , I needed 24 place settings . After shopping around , I found these were my best bet for such a large quantity . I purchased 2 boxes of 12 place settings each for a little over $100.00 . Now , as items go on saleI have began to purchase accent settings in colors/patterns to spice it up/mix and match . <p> Love these ! We actually just registered for the C&amp;B ones for our wedding . A friend recommended doing white dishes with white serving pieces , because then you can throw in a few fun pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the money ! <p> I love white dishes ! I use Corelle in Winter White . They are perfect for everyday &amp; can be dressed up for holidays be adding colorful napkins and serving pieces . I purchased some of mine at Walmart and ordered some from Corelle web-site . I recently added another four settings from Walmart . I believe the set was $29.99 for dinner plate , cereal bowl , saucer &amp; cup four of each . I also added the salad plate &amp; pasta bowl at $2.76 each to complete the set . What I love most is Corelle is almost impossible to break except for cups as they are stonewear . <p> We registered for the Tin Can Alley line by Lenox and I LOVE all the pieces so much that after my wedding I decided to purchase more from this line ! The design is so versatile and not stuffy looking at all ( were not fancy fine china folks , but we wanted good quality china ) . Any type of food looks good on these plates- whether its a casual messy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so durable , we accidentally dropped a cup on top of one of our plates and there were no chips or even scratches . The best deal that I found for this line was waiting for them to go on sale at Macys , and then using a coupon on top of it . <p> I just got new white dishes as a wedding gift ! Ive been dying for real deal , grown up dishes for awhile now . I got the Oneida Regency 32 pc. set ( times 2 ) for $29.99/set . It looks a lot like Pottery Barns Emma set because of the beaded accent . Each set has 6 place settings plus a serving bowl and platter . I heart it so far , they seem really sturdy but not thick and bulky . <p> I have used white plates for several years now . They are so versatile to partner with fun linens and chargers . They never go out of style . My husband actually purchased ours at Target on a ridiculous after Christmas sale . They were something like 75-80% off because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white with a ribbed edge around the perimeter .

Im amazed how many perfectly beautiful napkins reduce in size after laundering . Agree on white plates purchased ours at Pier 1 and they are still in good shape . <p> I recently hopped on the white-dish bandwagon . I thought I 'd be bored with them , but that theyd do until I found something I was in love withand it turns out Im in LOVE with them . : ) Mine are plain ol Corelle bright smooth , and caress-ably simple . Also on mega-sale , since I got them from my local Corelle/Pyrex outlet store . : ) <p> I got a white dish set at ikea 6 dinner plates , 6 salad plates , and 6 bowls for $25 ! they have a great , simple , clean , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with other dishes that I like to collect as i find them at thrift stores and yard sales : ) <p> I got a white dish set at ikea 6 dinner plates , 6 salad plates , and 6 bowls for $25 ! they have a great , simple , clean , but contemporary shape to them , and I can mix them in with other dishes that I like to collect as i find them at thrift stores and yard sales : ) <p> When I got married last year , I was able to find some really great white dishes from Walmart that were almost identical to a set at Crate and Barrel . They only sale the really cute plates at Christmas . They have a new set now that are really cute , and you get 4 plates for $5 . Every set comes with four different dishes for $5 .

For many , fall is their most favorite season for its cooler weather and the guarantee of a vivid show from nature . <p> Keeping your fall decorating as simple as can be gives you less time spent indoors and more time spent outdoors enjoying the beauty of the changing season . Here are ten simple ways to decorate with autumn leaves ! <p> 1 . Spray adhesive , cardstock , and ribbon are all the supplies you 'll need to transform fallen leaves into ornaments for display on branches around your home . <p> 2 . Gather a collection of oak or maple leaves and string them up along a bookcase , table , or countertop for a festive fall display . <p> 3 . Decoupage small leaves to wax candles to dress them up for a centerpiece . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display them behind glass or in a shadow box to make seasonal shelf or mantel art . <p> 5 . The fall season brings the harvest and with it comes savory flavors . Schedule a wine tasting party and label your vino with cardstock leaves cut from colorful papers . <p> 6 . Acorns are easily glued to a craft frame , then layer a leaf on linen inside as a focal point . <p> 7 . Speaking of frames , if you have an empty one , paint it in a vivid hue and insert a simple autumn leaf garland as the subject matter . <p> 8 . Use a dab of craft glue to adhere real leaves or ones made from paper to a pumpkin , vary the colors of the leaves or paper for interest . <p> 9 . Gather miniature vases and insert leaves collected on an autumn walk for a colorful display on a tray . <p> 10 . Clip branches and place them in a tall vase for a simple yet stunning show on the mantel . <p> Its so exciting to see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall and all the beautiful warm colors . Although I live in calif. and the tress do n't  turn like the east coast I still manage to find a small collection . Fall is exciting to me because it means the holidays are just around the corner.Thanks Better Homes and Gardens I have always loved your ideas ! <p> Gourds can be used in so many ways . Decorate them and make them into bird houses . Make into musical instruments by putting rice or other small hard objects in them for a rhythm instrument . A hole on one side can create " notes " when you slap your hand over it , compressing the air inside . Make a centerpiece by arranging some with unusual shapes with fall leaves , acorns or other seasonal objects . I have an interesting branch which I decorate with fall leaves , and vines .

Once you have your measurements you can sit down and figure out how big each square needs to be . Uggg. - This was the least fun part of the whole process but probably the most important . Measure , measure , measure ! <p> Then get a laser level that will stick to your ceiling . Mine uses adhesive strips . This whole projects is easier if you have a helper so grab a willing assistant too : ) After you make marks along the perimeter , then use the laser level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and I use a long piece of molding as our straight edge to trace the laser line across the ceiling . Once you trace all the lines going one direction , then trace them going the opposite way to create your squares . I guess it depends on the size of your ceiling but this really did n't  take as much time as it sounds like it would . <p> I marked every other square with an X to show which ones would be painted the darker green . <p> When I taped , I did n't  cover the line up . This way it would get painted . I figured I would have less pencil lines to clean up when all was said and done . P.S. Magic Eraser will get pencil off really well . <p> This is the part I kind of dread mentioning . You will need to tape twice . I am sure there are other ways I could have approached this project , but I knew that doing it this way would create really straight , clean lines . You will tape so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape all of it at the same time because you have to tape outside of the line for one row which puts the tape inside the next row which is why some squares look smaller. - <p> My secret to getting beautiful lines when painting stripes or squares is to use the- base paint to seal the tape . My ceilings are- heavily textured , so even with good quality painters tape you would get some leaks . This way , any leaks are the same color as the ceiling and you wo n't notice them at all. - It adds one more step but it is worth it. - - Brush ( or roll ) towards the tape . <p> With this technique you end up with very clean lines . <p> Here it is with half of the squares painted . Sorry for the bad picture quality , it was taken with a flash at night. - - <p> Next you need to- peel off the tape . I take the tape off while the paint is still wet , otherwise some of the paint will come off too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry for at least 24 hours . You will be taping over the newly painted squares and you do n't  want to risk the first layer of paint coming off. - Follow the same steps for the second round of painting squares . <p> And there you have it ! - It was a lot of work but it was worth it ! - - I have had this on my to do list for over 6 years ! - I am happy it is finally done and I get to enjoy it everyday . <h> 16 comments <p> Wow , I can tell that took some time and skill ! It looks amazing . I painted a design on my ceiling recently and it was not that fun . Ugh , the measuring ! I still ca n't believe you conquered this . My ceiling was a LOT simpler , so I bow to you and your dedication ! " Check it out here . " <p> Wow ! Stacy- that was an amazing grid you did on the ceiling !

@@99057993 @3257993/ <h> Dare to Do Dark <p> By Kate Riley June 24 , 2010 <p> It 's the beginning of summer , and I feel the need to make everything around me light and bright , but I 'm finding myself increasingly drawn to the drama of dark painted walls . When it comes to painting a room an intensely dark color like chocolate or charcoal , I confess I have n't taken the plunge because I fear the dreaded cave effect that may occur . Oh , I 've tried samples on the wall , but in the end I opt for the lighter hue . <p> I especially love high contrast in design , juxtaposing the crisp white against the dramatic dark . An intensely deep hue , balanced with plenty of light , conveys sophistication and elegance " two feelings I absolutely adore in a space . Here are some intense walls that I 'm drawn to these days . Fancy that , in the middle of June . <p> What about you ? What are your thoughts on dark painted walls ? Does it feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste ? Or have you taken the plunge and pulled off the high drama ? Do share your darkest ' thoughts ! <h> 98 comments <p> Great pics ! I LOVE lighter colors.BUT , have used all of the colors shown in our home.and highly recommend taking the plunge . There is something bold and beautiful about them.and the depth is really gorgeous . My kitchen was that blue with white cabinets , and now it is Bleeker beige . Its more calmingbut I often do miss the spark of color . Our dining room is redLOVE it . Our library is the deep brownso cozy . The kids bath was black , and I loved the contrast again . We just painted it " brooke trout " - a mushroomy grayits gorgeous . That said , I have two rooms that are " glamorous white " my studio and bedroom , and that is very airy and calming too . <p> I do n't  LOVE the dark walls , they are not happy enough for me . I think the photos you posted are beautiful and the dark color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in these photos helps balance the darker color . Thank you for all of your ideas and inspiration . <p> I have mostly medium-toned colors throughout my home and I 'm happy because its the best of both worlds ( not too light not too dark ) , however I have deep red in my dining room ( Sundried Tomato by BM ) and I absolutely love it . I think it works extremely well because my dining room is built off the end of the house so it has a window in each of the three outer walls , which brings in lots of light when you need it , but at night , the deep red feels really cozy and warm . <p> someone gave me left over earth paint and i used it to paint my bedroom ceiling and wall ( like your pic Burnham Design ) . it feels kinda gloomy and i cant decide to go with it and add pops of colour , or re-paint everything in which case i can already hear my HUSBANDs darkest thoughtssigh . <p> I LOVE that first room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white accessories . I 'm on the verge of redoing my guest bedroom and want to paint the furniture white and do really dark gray walls ! This is definitely inspiring me ! <p> I love the second room ! While it has a very deep blue I still find that room light and bright . I think its the white drapes that does it . They are all dramatic but I think the key is when you see the room does your eye go right to the wall color first or the room as a whole ? <p> I looooove dark walls ! My kitchen is brick red , dining room is a little lighter in a sage/olive green , my office is eggplant , and my bedroom is a dark blue/gray . The living room leading to the stairs &amp; upstairs hall are all tan , keeping it from getting too intense . All the trim , doors , and moldings are the same bright white , and the ceilings are all white . I love the contrast , and if you have an older home like mine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> I 'm not super crazy about it , to be honest . I 've only seen a few rooms that I like with dark walls . Maybe because I live in a tiny little house . I think you 'd have to have high ceilings and a LOT of white to pull it off . But I do like the pic that just shows the shelves with the white pictures . Maybe I 'd like it on a smaller scale . <p> I painted my hallway a deep red and put up pictures in black frames , worst mistake I ever made , it is like a dungeon . The light switch is at the end of the hall so when you come out of the bedroom you cant see ! As soon as I have time its going back to a light color . It does look nice but it makes it seem so closed in ! <p> I say as long as there 's enough light in the room and light colored things to balance it out it wo n't feel like a cave . I suprised my husband with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple years ago . Ill email you pictures ! <p> I have always loved dark rooms , especially the dark brick reds and dark choco browns ! BUT , I just went this weekend and picked out new paint . And much to my surprise I picked out all light colors ! I went in to the store with no preconceived idea of what colors I wanted . Went in " blank " . <p> I picked out for my living room and dining room a color called Glass Slipper by Ben Moore and for my kitchen Camouflage and Simply White by Ben . Moore . <p> I love dark walls when they 're done well . I 'm moving in a few months , so I 'm not up for re-doing any rooms right now , but I 'm definitely going to consider charcoal gray in my next bedroom . Everywhere else will probably be white , as I 've spent the last two years living in Holland and have really come to appreciate bright white rooms . <p> I am loving the deep blue on the walls of the Lonny Magazine dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom at my parents house a chocolate brown with white accents and I still love those colors together : ) <p> I had a dark brown bedroom , and it was a small bedroom too , but ( I think ) it looked great and I loved it . I wanted a really cozy " sleep friendly " ambience ! And I love to sleep when its pitch black around me , so that was close . My current bedroom is also dark actually , grey-blue . I guess I love dark bedrooms ! I love the feeling of room #4 ! <p> I 'm definitely an advocate for the dark walls . We have Belgian Sweet by Behr in our master bedroom along with light cream carpet , white curtains and white/cream/sea glass blue bedding . We have 2 large windows that let in a ton of light throughout the whole day ( if our blinds are open ) so it counteracts the cave feeling . <p> gorgeous rooms ! i dared to go dark in my bedroom charcoal . i was terrified i would end up with a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite rooms in the house ! you should try it : ) <p> Yes , yes , yes , YES ! ! ! Oh , be still my heart ! Those pictures are heavenly for me ! They are me even if I would n't pick those exact colors , just seeing all those dark , rich hues makes my heart flutter ! Let 's see dining/living room is red , bedroom is red , office is dark purple , girls room is fuschia and turquoise , boys room is blue as is the kids bathroom and the family room downstairs is red and black . Love color ! And that room you show that is black &amp; white with turquoise accents ( 4th from bottom ) STUNNING ! I will have to bookmark this entry ! <p> I love love love the staircase photo from House Beautiful ( photo #4 ) . The floor is painted to look like marble , which I 'm tempted to do for my countertops . My landlord built EVERYTHING out of plywood , and will let me faux finish as I please . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , and it came out awesome . Im excited to start the counters . <p> I love love love the staircase photo from House Beautiful ( photo #4 ) . The floor is painted to look like marble , which I 'm tempted to do for my countertops . My landlord built EVERYTHING out of plywood , and will let me faux finish as I please . I already did the floors to look like wide plank cherry wood , and it came out awesome . Im excited to start the counters . <p> For many years the walls in my living room were a deep chocolate brown with crisp white trim . We had a floor to ceiling bookcase on one wall and to me that room felt like a cozy English library . It was our favorite room because it was charming and comfortable and I received many complements <p> I love the darker colors on the walls as it pops my white woodwork . I know what you 're saying as we had all light shades of color on the walls when we first moved in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then got much braver from there . The thing I love about it , is you do n't  like it and its too much , repaint it : ) The pictures you posted are gorgeous ! <p> Since we rent , I cant paint our walls which actually turns into a blessing . Like the school paper that has more clarity because the assignment has a " topic " , I am given more direction by understanding what I can not do " verses the " you can write about anything " freedom that ends up pushing you into a corner whimpering , " I just do n't  know what to do . Too many options ! " <p> My most bold choice of color happened just a few weeks ago . I scored some custom Amy Butler , lined curtains in coral . I did n't  know where they were going , but for two panels for seven dollars , I knew they were coming home with me . At my next rummage sale , I scored an almost brand new queen sized , orange and white duvet cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint my lamp a fantastic kelly green to complement ) . Now my bedroom has a splendid punch of color that inspires me to begin moving out the mellow colors of our living room for more lively contrast . <p> I highly recommend more drama in color . What Ive seen that seems to work the best is to start out with lots of white . White furniture . White this and that . And then pull in a punch of two or three items that are superbly splendid . Bright red . Or turquoise . Or whatever your fancy is . And if it sits well with you , continue bringing one more thing in . Again and again . <p> I think you should totally go dark/bright/contrast . I quite fancy the idea of seeing where you choose to let it reside in your home . <p> I love the blue , but then again I 'm always drawn to any shade of blue ! My powder room is a very dark gray . I 've considered painting it a lighter shade but its a small little powder room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make it work : ) So Kate are you going to paint a room in your lovely house dark too ? <p> Love the dark , bold rooms . Paired with white flowers and other white objects really makes a nice contrast . I like you , love those combos , but always paint lighter colors . I love the Chandeliers in all the rooms too ! <p> Oh , I dare to do dark alright I usually end up with a painted room turning out MUCH darker than it did on the itty bitty sample . ( : i guess I am drawn to the drama of the darker colors and they do n't  look all that dark until I get the whole room done . i just go with it lifes too short to re-paint the entire room and over a couple of days I find I really like it ! <p> I have always had at least one room or wall dark in every single home I have ever lived in . <p> I just had the wall in our long stairway painted a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again white trim and works well with old style ( I have 18thc. etchings hanging on the wall ) as well as contemporary ( in the landing stands a light gay concrete table against the wall ) . <p> Could not do a whole house though ! But one room or wall for added drama absolutely ! A <p> I love it . But I have proven to myself that I can only visit it and not live with it . I had a dark muddy green in my living room , and a chocolate dining room at one point . I have never regretted going light after living in the " cave " for a spell . Perhaps it can work in rooms you do n't  spend the majority of your time in . For example a guest room . LOL <p> I just ca n't make myself love the super saturated , dark walls . They seem so ominous and imposing . I do love that kitchen pic from Country Living though , with all the white trim , cabinets and the Carrera marble countertops . <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of bedrooms one is blue and one is on the verge of brown/tan . What I do love in these pictures youve shared is the white the molding , trim , furniture , accessories and how it makes a lot of these spaces not feel as dark as they might be otherwise . I also find that even though many people like to go light and bright in the Summer , I feel like it is probably cooler in the darker rooms a nice psychological cool for the hot and humid days . I wind up closing our shades and drapes on these really hot and humid days to make it feel cooler in the house plus keep the beating sun out , so its dark anyway ! <p> Oh , wow ! Once again , you have made me think outside the box . I love light and bright colors . I 've always wanted a room painted daffodil yellow . But that room by Amanda Nesbit did me in ! It looks lie summer . Maybe its the mustard folded Roman Shade . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark like that though . P.S. Where do you find all these fabulous pictures ? Do you just surf all those websites ? <p> Wow , what a gorgeous collection of photos . I like a mix of dark and light roomsdepending on the room . My living/dining room is full of windows and painted light with a beachy decor . My den is painted dark terracotta to have a cozy , cocoon feel . I also have a small bathroom right off the pool that I painted a dark navyits a nice transition for your eyes when you come in from the bright sun . So I use color to invoke the feeling I want from each room . <p> I love dark walls . My master bedroom is very dark . Kind of a goldish brown with green undertones . The room is quite large so it works well . If I could get consistant with my blog I would post a pic for you . However we are moving . Probably into a much smaller place so I may not go so dark . My alter ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will go that way . hhmm . Too many options and only so many rooms to decorate . <p> I love that first blue dining area feels like the ocean . I think to pull off a dark walled room you 've got to have enough light to balance it out . A large picture window , or a light or white ceiling coupled with matching trims throughout . Our house has no South or West facing windows ( Zero Lot Line ) , so anything darker than a Taupe just looks like a cave . If we could take advantage of the Western Evening sky , I would definately consider a dramatically dark paint scheme . <p> In my last house I did several dark rooms ( deep red living room , super dark blue bathroom ) , and a really dramatic deep silvery purple in venetian plaster as the focal wall in the master bedroom . I really liked all of these , but it seems that dark paint has really fallen out of favor , lately . I wonder if it is because it just does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming in the windows . They look so refreshing on the computer screen . I like that breezy costal cottage look , but I do n't  live by the beach . I have a large tract built home in AZ , and I have to figure out what works here . I 'm not an all-white girl , but I am trying to make the colors flow better through my house , so I am going a bit more neutral than I did before . <p> I do n't  have a white wall in my house ! ( Or ecru , or tan , or anything blah ) Last summer I was revamping our bedroom , and ended up painting it a darker gray with paint I found for $5 at the Habitat for Humanity Restore . I put up white " crown molding " ( actually trim I also got at the Restore ) , and I have it decorated with some of my bright modern art paintings and quilts , and some black and white photos . I absolutely love it ! <p> I 'm loving that dark blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything yellow and grey . I painted my entertainment/family room a really dark grey/green ( its called Coconut Husk ) on the TV wall and its pretty but also sets the mood for movie watching : ) <p> DAGNABBIT ( I 'm from the South and am , therefore , not only allowed , but REQUIRED to utilize such verbiage as DAGNABBIT ! ! ! ) . <p> DOUBLE DAGNABBIT ! ! ! <p> I SO wish I could find all my photos from where we renovated our historic property in VA ( before we moved to Huntsville , AL ) as we painted the downstairs salon a rich chocolate brown from Ralph Lauren . <p> Perfection . <p> But , alas , I can not locate them on any of our computersmay have to find the originals and scan them.but still hoping to find the digital versions already incorporated *somewhere* . <p> All of this rambling to say , though , even if I can not show you the almost sexual ( heck , yeah ! ) sensuality of my chocolate walls , that I 'm diggin , REALLY diggin these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in my $2.97 opinion that the deep colors , especially in such stark contrast to sparkling white molding , are GAW-JUS ! ! ! ! ! <p> As always , Kate , you rock my world . What a blessing you are to everyone that reads you . <p> As someone with a red room I totally understand the cozy warmth a room with dark walls can createthere in lies my dilemma . I begin to feel that our home is a " winter " house rather than a " summer " house due to the red family room . However , the insecurity passes and fall arrives and I 'm very comfortable with my choice . : - ) <p> I love all of these rooms ! I just had my bedroom painted a dark blue ( much like the blue in the second picture ) . I was told that it might close in the roombut because I have an arched ceiling and two good sized windows it does n't  close it in at all . So if you have a good bit of natural light , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so glad I did n't  let anybody talk me out of the blueI love it ! <p> These photos are truly inspirational ! In the opposite fashion of you , we painted almost every room in our home a dark or vibrant hue , and now were back tracking to the world of light and bright . We have , however , kept our office a deep colonial blue , and I 'm so happy we stuck with that . It seems like the perfect color for an office , especially since we have a white sidboard , white curtains , desk , and shelves . <p> The bathroom went from a slate to a barely-there gray , the bedroom just went from orange to not-quite greenwhich I 'm still struggling with there . My heart wants deep and vibrant , but my tired brain wants soft and light . Oh the choices ! <p> my dear pottery barn magazine lured me to the dark side a few years ago . a beautiful , deep , chocolately brown . but i 'm sorry to say , our love affair was over in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following summer , craving a more serene and brighter space . the brown felt lovely in the winter and fall , but come summer it felt too heavy for me. good luck ! <p> I think , like a lot of people have mentioned , if its balanced with proper light and enough accents of white or whatever cheeriness rocks your boat , that it looks great . Otherwise it could look too grandma or Addams family . I think the accent colors and decor can make or break it , so I personally would n't do it to my house unless I really had the time to devote to making sure it does n't  feel like an estate sale . If I ever do have the time though , I 'd love to . <p> I definitely do n't  gravitate to dark rooms , but my husband really likes them . So we 've compromised in two rooms : the half-bath ( recently painted BMs Van Deusen Blue ) , and the guest room ( Behrs Chocolate Cupcake ) . I love how the half bath turned out . Despite being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depth and coordinates really well with the colors in the adjacent dining room/kitchen . I 've grown to really dislike the dark brown guest room . I just do n't  find it relaxing , and would love to repaint it if I can get the hubs to agree ! <p> Brava for an original post which flies in the face of so many images we see at this time of year ! If I lived on my own , I would probably try a dark color somewhere easy like a powder room , but frankly , Beloved Husband would move out and right now I value my marriage more ; ) <p> I gravitate towards dark rooms . I LOVE fall shades . My walls are beige , sage green , and gold throughout my home with sage , creams , browns and oranges in the decor . In the summer I always wish for those light beachy rooms I see all over magazines and the blog-world , but I know I love that hunkered down feel of fall when I 'm relaxing in my homeespecially when fall actually arrives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decor in the spring.but I never do , I just love my things too much . <p> I love light and dark , but have always gravitated more towards the dark colors with light colors sprinkled in . Since we live in AZ we get lots of sunlight . I love the drama of the dark thanks for posting ! <p> This is too funny ! ! I just painted my Master Bedroom a dark blue just like the pictures and I have plans to paint my living room Chocolate Brown very soon ! I love dark ! ! To me it just makes the room feel cozy . I think you just have to add in fun pops of color and light ! : ) <p> I love color on the walls it comforts me and makes me feel that I am safe in my little nest . I find that lately a lot of our projects ( my dh and I do architecture and interiors ) are using less color on the walls . I like the look but not for living in personally . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings you serenity . Those pictures are fabulous ( LOVE that Crosby St. Hotel brilliant ) . <p> Our dining room is the darkest color on the chip ! Kelly-Moore Arch Gold . It is an older color , so could not get a link to reference the color . My friend next door painted their dining room black , and has a white hutch , and maybe 1 other white item ? It looks great . : ) <p> I 've always been drawn to the luxurious and dramatic nature of deep walls popped with white trim . Our 1920 cape cod home is on a tight city lot in the NE part of the country . We do n't  always have the best light streaming thru our windows , so I 've been hesitant to go with anything deeper than a true midtone . However , I 've recently done a flip-flop with our dining &amp; living rooms . Our new living room is in the middle of our home and gets diffuse indirect light thru most of the day . However , it now seems perfectly suited to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been looking at a deep mocha brown for the walls . Planning on swatching some samples this weekend . <p> I just painted my dining room ( which was previously a sky blue ) dark brown and I am lovin it ! Even in the summer I find myself craving the darker colors they just seem so sophisticated and comfortable . I am even considering painting the ceiling the dark brown as well <p> We do n't  have any in our home now , but have in the past . I did love them when I had them , but I do also love my lighter more neutral wallsonly because I love to change things up and have found it easier to do so with the neutral colors . <p> I have to say that I really do not like the dark walls . At this moment I am re-painting my bedroom from a dark chocolate to Palladian Blue , a robins egg color . Our bedroom is fairly large , but I just did n't  like how dark and cave like it always felt . Perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels darkthus I only want light and bright and fresh colors . But it really just comes down to personality and personal preference . <p> We have a very very long entry hallway.when we moved into our house it was painted with 8 ft marquee diamonds . They were the first thing to go ! We painted that wall a dark chocolate brown ( Benjamin Moore Traditional ) and we love it ! The rest of the house is painted a lighter color to lighten up the rest of the house . The dark color definitely adds drama to the house . <p> 1 . Let me say , I am new to your blog , and find it delightful , helpful , and inspiring ! 2 . I like dark walls in the right places . We renovated our apartment last summer and I took a few chances with a dark navy blue . One area is our kitchen a little 7x9 ' galley style kitchen . With no windows . But its well-lit and has light birch cabinets . I LOVE it ! And I get many complements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark navy feature wall in our bedroom ( on the headboard wall ) , and I like that too . Especially since that 's where we sleep I almost wish I 'd done the whole room navy ( the other walls are soft grey . ) So I say , try it ! Consider how you live in a space and if its appropriate ( I would n't do a dark hallway or bathroom ) , find a deep colour you really love , and pair it with lots of contrasting light fabrics or furniture . Also , my husband really likes it too . I think there 's something masculine about dark colours . <p> ( P.S. I 'm from Canada where we do n't  get a whole lotta sunlight in the winter , and even then I liked my darker rooms ) <p> *LOVE* all the bold colors in the photos and I 'm just now venturing into bold color space myself . I feel my rooms are too tiny to handle that magnificent a statement , but I am going to go rich chocolate on my built-in fireplace mantel in my living rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was the one that picked the same color for our couches and now I have an excuse to pull it all together ! Thanks for all the wonderful inspiration and keep up the good work ! <p> How ironic that you would post this ! I am , at this very moment , in the process of repainting my great room . Its a big room and my hope is that a richer color will cozy it up . Goodbye peach , hello chocolate . Hmm , now I 'm suddenly feeling hungry <p> I have been toying with painting over the light oak trim in the room with a crisp white . Hopefully the beautiful photos you 've posted will help me convince hubby . <p> I love dark colors . My living room is chocolate brown , and my master bedroom is going to be painted a charcoal . I think darker colors are wonderful and dramatic . I just believe that with those dark colors , you do need some bursts of bright color . In my living room , my accent colors are a burnt orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master bedroom will have the accent color plum . Good luck . I 'm sure you 'll pick the colors you are most comfortable with . My best friend is amazing at interior decorating , and she is the one who convinced me to take the plunge and paint my walls darker colors . Now , I 'm hooked ! ! ! What room are you planning to paint ? ? ? Good luck . <p> I have gone dark once . It was our kitchen which was a sea of honey oak wood tones ( floors and cabinets ) and it was 15+25 . When we first moved it the room was so stark just white on the walls and trim it just looked wrong ! I wanted to do a color that would make the rest of the room sing so I picked a deep dark federal blue . Everyone thought I was crazy but it WORKED ! The room was fantastic and became an even warmer place because the oranges in the wood played off the blue so well . I do wish it had more natural light but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DO IT ! <p> My entire living is Providence Olive by Ben Moore and my trim is Monterey White . We have really dark hardwoods and i love it ! Lots of bright white in my brick painted fireplace and mantle , a distressed white armoire my parents made and my kitchen cabinets are Mon White with wood stained knobs . I still love it so much 4 years later ! And I love all these pics ! <p> I have pulled off a dark caramel color in my bedroom of all places . I am not sure if it was the right room , but there is light in there with windows and bedding all light in hue . I like it at night when the lamps are on and it feels very warm . I waffle back and forth about repainting it . Too many coats of primer perhaps . <p> I love the look of these bold and dark rooms , especially when there 's lots of contrast with white to balance it out . I have a hard time living with them , though . I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a year or two . So I guess I love them in small dosesand in other peoples houses . <p> I have two dark rooms , the master bedroom and my sons . My sons room has two windows and is painted a dark cafe mocha color and totally works ! The master is a dark grey with deep red and bright white for contrast . While I LOVE the color scheme , its too dark for the physical room . There 's only one window and it never seems to get enough light . It does n't  work for the room , it really depends on the amount of natural light you get in the room . Ever since we moved into our room a couple of years ago , waking up has been difficult ! I really need to repaint it . : ) <p> BEEEautiful ! I want it ! I would love to do some of these , but sadly none of these colours would work where I live . I think that it would require a lot of natural , bright light with lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total cave . Since I live in a basement suite its already a cave and dark paint would not help at all . I already feel like I 'm deprived of scenery and sunlight : ( <p> Funny , I found your blog and was so drawn in by all of your light colors . We have lived in our house now for almost 3 years and I have n't done much to the 1985 decor . The previous owners had just painted the master and the living room a dark greenish color that is so depressing . As I 'm getting older , I realize I 'm liking lighter rooms too or it might just be that we all need a change from what we have ! <p> I have HATED having dark walls in my house . When I moved in 3 years ago , I had my living room and master bedroom painted a beautiful portobello ( mushroom ) color . For 2 years , I 've regretted it . It has made those rooms just sink . So 2 days ago at 8pm , I decided were done with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light color and we LOVE it . The room looks twice the size , I do n't  need lights on all day . I cant believe I waited so long . Ill never go back to dark walls again . <p> I really love dark walls because I think they automatically make a room feel " cozy , " no matter how big or how small . I posted a pic of my living room recently that reminds me a lot of the Decorpad pic posted above ( with the pitchers ) and the BHG image with the white couch . What attracts me to those rooms is the high contrast between the light &amp; the dark . So I guess my feeling is that I really like dark walls but for me they have to be tempered with light accessories . 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99057994 @3257994/ <h> The Risers and The Treads <p> By Kate Riley October 7 , 2010 <p> OK , first , let me announce that the eligibility criteria for the upcoming HomeGoods Link Party has been expanded to include how you would create your own Mom Cave with a prize from HomeGoods . I thank my kind readers for mentioning this obvious category . I officially smacked myself on the head and said " Well duh ! " <p> So , please take note of that modification and mark your calendars for Oct 25th . Also , you can submit your entry via email if you do n't  have a blog ( Smack , " duh " again . ) <p> <p> Yesterday , a very good thing happened in my world . A ten year dream of mine came true . The hardwood risers and the treads on my entry staircase were installed . <p> Glory halleluiah . <p> A month ago we had just the top landing and the bottom step professionally installed because , long story short , we could n't use the standard wood treads , we needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . <p> Exhibit A <p> Our good friend owns a flooring company , so he sent out the special order materials and the very helpful Felix to do the job in just a few hours . Its so nice to know a flooring guy , especially one who will let you DIY as much of the project as you choose to keep costs down . <p> But the rest of the steps sat as plywood for nearly a month while the riser and tread material gathered dust in the living room . Tick tick tick went the clock . <p> After living with plywood steps for nearly a month , I noticed my husband preferred to spend his fall weekends watching football on the couch , not renting a table saw to cut risers . Not that he s ever lazy , he s just working hard during the week , very tired , and in need of down time . <p> Growing impatient , tapping my toe on said plywood , I gently suggested we enlist some help . I swear I saw a twinkle in his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We called our contact and found out we would have to spend enough for about six more hours on extra labor to help us cut and install the risers . <p> So we did this calculation : <p> In conclusion , bringing in the experienced staircase riser and tread installer for another $300 made the most financial sense , especially since we needed an absolutely professional look . The best part of all was I played apprentice during the install yesterday . <p> here 's the step by step we followed for installing new risers and hardwood treads : <p> 1 ) First we cut the edges of the plywood steps with a jig saw . I had planned to use my SkilSaw but the blade needs sharpened so Felix used the jig instead . Sawdust everywhere ! <p> 2 ) Next it was time to install the risers , so we worked our way up from the bottom to the top , setting the riser first , then cutting and installing the tread , one by one . <p> The edge of the risers are measured with a carpenters right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risers edge sits just above the edge of the plywood tread , in order that the hardwood tread will set perfectly on top . That unpainted wood you see along the sides was where the carpet used to hide the oak . <p> Then came the cutting , which was thrilling and scary at the same time working with a table saw . Especially after Felix told me some stories of careless workers he knows who have lost fingers on table saws . There were serious heart palpitations followed up by the pride of my anxiety conquered . And I cut me some risers ! <p> Not only did the risers have to be ripped at the perfect height with the table saw , but Felix showed me how he sets the blade at a 1/16 angle when cutting the sides to create a subtle wedge shape ( see below ) . <p> The angled cut prevents gaps after installation , and guarantees a clean seam up against the tread , which avoids the need for caulking or trim . Pretty nifty ! Another thing I never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grateful for an experienced installer . <p> We made the same angle cuts on the sides as well . <p> And that 's how you get seamless risers that do n't  need any trim to hide gaps or imperfections . ( The dark spots on the sides under the treads are the unpainted edges where the carpet used to cover the wood . ) <p> The risers were set with some subfloor and deck adhesive ( see below ) and nailed into place . <p> 3 ) Installing treads . After the first riser was installed , we cut the first tread . Again , the sides of the treads are cut at a very slight angle with the compound miter saw to create a seamless fit . Each step required a proper amount of subfloor and deck adhesive , used to eliminate squeaks and glue the steps into place . <p> Then we used a mallet to wedge them into place and secured them with a nail gun . <p> And we went up , one by one , riser then tread , riser then tread , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd rather spend a day learning how to cut and install hardwood stairs than go on a wild shopping spree . Call me construction crazy . <p> There are miles to go before I sleep . I still have to strip the bottom step ( curvy side ) ; fill holes with putty ; sand ; stain ; poly three coats , prime and paint . <p> Every . Single . Step . <p> Easier said then done when you 've got two little munchkins running around . <p> But theyve grown up around sawdust and power tools with all their limbs intact , so I 'm sure I can get them to cooperate . <p> I 'm seriously pinching myself today because I now have this . <p> I even experimented with some stains yesterday , and I cant wait to show you how it all turns out in the end . Hooray for hardwood steps ! <p> Would it have been easier to stain the treads before installing them ? And for that matter , painting the white parts before installing the treads ? Not sure how this all works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about getting paint on stain and stain on paint . <p> Your steps look just like mine right now ! I had plaster work done on my hall going upstairs and the plasterers ruined the entire staircase.so I have what looks exactly like yours . The flooring people are coming soon to sand/stain the treads and paint the risers white ! All of my hardwood floors in my house are light oak .. basically the floors were sanded and then clear poly went on . I love the look of the dark stain on the treads.the floors at the top of staircase will be painted white . Do you think dark treads will be ok even though my hardwoods are white and light ? The tile in my house is very dark . BIG DECISIONS TO MAKE : ) ! <p> Okay , between you and Sarah I am convinced this is a project I have to add to my to do list . Maybe not tomorrow , or next week , but someday ! They are fabulous , and they get even better ? Looking forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new stairs too . I am currently in the process of redoing mine also . I was lucky to have very nice bullnose treads underneath the carpet . The hardest part for me is that one side of the stairs are open . That part has a bullnose edge also , but is going to require a bit more elbow grease and staining around the balusters . I am just loving them so far even thought they are not finished yet . Yours look great . Isnt it funny what can make us happy . My husband does n't  quite get it how excited I am about un-carpeted steps . <p> Congratulations ! You are so close to the end . My husband just finished our stairs , same project . Thankfully , he is the tool man and I love that , like you , we can do it ourselves ( well , him on this one ) and save a bundle . When the runner is on and the wallpaper hung , I 'll post it . But until then , I 'm going to enjoy yours and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a natural finish , and I 'll bet any money you 're going dark ? ) Ca n't wait to see more . <p> They look pretty good ! My husband and I own a hardwood company and he is a stair expert as well ; - ) Needless to say , we have Brazilian Cherry Treads and paint-grade risers and we love them ! I love your staircase it was just dying for hardwoods ! <p> Hi Em , its funny , I thought of that too ! But then with all the cutting and nailing , they were going to get scuffed , need patched and then stained or painted again , so we just decided to do it all after install . Now the trick will be keeping toes off the drying stain and poly . I 've heard to do every other step and stain/poly in stages . Will definitely try that approach ! Kate <p> Hi Carol we are staining the steps dark ( walnut ) to match the handrail . I do n't  have a matchy matchy tendency , so the contrast with the light hardwood floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark too , maybe next year . : - ) <p> I 'm so so sooo jealous . I 'm dying to get rid of the nasty carpet on our stairs but our treads are particle board and I do n't  have the dough to replace them . I 'm trying to figure out a way to paint the treads without it looking rediculous since the particle is n't perfectly smooth . <p> Those are looking beautiful ! I 'm so glad I have n't started our stair project yet . This will help if we have plywood underneath ( which I 'm praying we do n't  ! ) I sooo understand about enjoying the learning and doing the construction process . <p> The stairs are looking great , and thanks for the tip about cutting the treads in a wedge . I 'll keep that in mind next time were working on stairs ! Our current ones are caulked , which is actually fine because the risers are white . But I 'd prefer no need for caulking at all . <p> Hi ! Weve been inspired by your blog and plan to tackle this project soon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs a little less slippery ? My kids are 5 and 8 and I worry about them being really slick with socks on ( for me too ! ) Is there something you can do to make them a little bit " grippier ? " Thanks ! <p> That was fun following your weekend ! I wish I could have been apprentice #2 -I could have held your coffee for you . : ) Great idea about staining/coating every-other-step , so that they are still usable . Our stairs and risers are all wood finish . I just couldnt face the white risers , as our boys were both under 7 when we moved in . I still think they are hard on the steps now ! ( 9 years later . ) Right now I have a muslin fabric ( starched ) onto the risers , because I needed the background contrast . I blogged about it , because I have a " scene " on the stairs right now . : ) Going to change out the fabric next month . Thanks for sharing ! I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the mall too ! ( As long as someone brings me a Starbucks . ) <p> AWWWWWWWESOME ! ! ! Im thrilled for you ! And even a superb DIY guru like you deserves the break from hiring a pro every now and then . With all of our home renovation ( our last home was over 100 years old ! ) we did an immense amount ourselves , but the times we gave in and hired someone else really made the whole place look more professional . ( I suppose that 's like wearing the great high quality name brand jacket with an inexpensive skirtthe whole ensemble looks better ! ) I swear , my husband will NEVER install carpet on his own ever again and when we hired the pros this last time I thought he might actually hug the guy and start weeping when he had finished so quickly ! <p> This looks like so much work Kate- but the result is fabulous . Hats off to you and your husband for even attempting such a project and for knowing when to call in some professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter growing up before my eyes ? ! Is her hair lighter , longer ? Such a cutie ! <p> Can you give me a reason why you beveled the edges ? The hardwood tread looked to over lap the riser . What was the over thickness of the tread at the foot area not the bull nose ? Just want to make sure I stay within building code . Thank you for you help .. <p> My staircase looks identical to yours in every way except one thing : it is open on one side to there already is about 6 inches of wood on the edge , then carpet , then wall . How would you recommend I remove the carpet and install new risers ? The options seem to be to either 1 ) match the riser to the 6 inch edge piece like you did on your bottom step or 2 ) take apart the entire staircase , refinish it and reassemble with new risers that go from wall to edge . <p> I HATED the carpet on my basement steps so I did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended prefinished treads which worked out great . They are n't  slippery at all and the project was done in one day . I also painted the risers before installation . Now I adore my new steps . <p> Oh , my ! I want to do this , but I am scared ! We built a deck with angles , but stairs ? ? ? Carpeting on the stairs is so hard to clean . Ugh . Its a mess ! I was also wondering the reason for the beveled edges . Any clues for me ? Thanks for the GREAT posts and step-by-step directions ! You give me confidence ! <p> I know this is an old post , but I wanted to thank you for your inspiration . A few years back I took project on at or old house . All the work you mentioned above was about the same and it killed me to move after all the work we put in , but I can honestly say it was my staircase that set us apart from other homes in the neighborhood . Our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the color was all wrong ( all blonde oak ) . I knew ( thanks to you ) I could make it amazing with a little ( a lot ) of work .

I look forward to reading about where you all live and what you love about it . <p> Quickly , I 'll share my three favorite things about where I live . For those who do n't know , I live in a great little town called Petaluma in Northern California , which had a little feature in Country Living last year . It 's 45 minutes north of San Francisco , 30 minutes from the coast , and next door to Sonoma in the heart of the Wine Country , which brings me to my first favorite thing about where I live . . . <p> 1 ) Proximity I 'm a lucky gal , I get to make day trips to San Francisco and some weekends we head out to the coast , but my most favorite thing about my town is being surrounded by vineyards and having quick access to great wines . <p> 2 ) Charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my town " we have a lot of unique Victorians and historic homes . Our family takes walks around town in the good weather months with all of the neighbors out and about , and it 's like a throwback to a bygone era , we love that . <p> 3 ) Second Hand Stores &amp; Scores Y'all know my incurable addiction for hunting down second hand treasures . Most of the furniture I find comes from thrift stores , and we have some really great ones here locally . My town is also known for its antique shops and the annual Antique Faire when the downtown streets close , and vendors from all over the Bay Area come here to sell their unique vintage finds . I force request nicely that the hub stays home with the kiddies while I stroll and admire all the old cool stuff . For me , it 's one of the best days of the year ! <p> What about you ? <p> Link up with a story about the favorite things in your town , and please stop by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this idea ! ! !

I had a lot of fun getting pics of the historic " old towne " area in my town . I do n't  get down there often , but its the best part of my areahistory that dates back before the Civil War ! I have to agree with your mention of proximityIm able to get to Washington DC and even Richmond very easilyso much to do !

Ive been completely inspired by the slow place of life here , which is what I wrote about . Its given me a lot of time for introspection . I never thought I could last without a phone constantly attached to the internet all day long . I hope I can take these lessons with me when we return back to the states in 2.5 years . <p> Thanks for the little tour ! ! I 'd love a real life tour of those gorgeous old homes ! You truly are blessed with a great place to live . And what a great reminder to not take it ( where we live me on the almost East coast ) for granted ! <p> This linky party is a great idea , love seeing where everyone is from .

Ill try , but I do n't  think I will make the 2 days left mark . But I should blog about my town and state . It is all I really know because I have never lived anywhere else . : ) <p> My boyfriends dad lives in Petaluma ! ! We went there Saturday night for dinner and on the drive into town , we kept talking about how much we loved that town and would maybe settle there one day ( the BF is from Sonoma so we may eventually end up there ) . Were practically neighbors , you know ! ! : ) <p> I love Petaluma for Antiques !

We took a trip out there several years ago and still reminisce about it ! Lagunitas Brewing ! Point Reyes ! Santa Rosa ! So many fun things to do . You are one lucky lady ! And thanks for hosting the link party ! I shared a favorite hike here in Central Oregon ! <p> I 'm loving this link party .

@@99057999 @3257999/ <h> Favorite New Stockings <p> By Kate Riley November 15 , 2016 <p> I'm- feeling under the weather today , I 'm fighting off that first sign of a cold so I 'm taking it easy . Zicam + homemade soup + hot tea has worked for me to block the onset of a cold in the past , fingers crossed I can escape this time too . I 'd like to focus on something positive , like all the merry making with friends and family that will take place over the next six weeks during the holiday season . <p> I was browsing around the web checking out all the new holiday decor , looking for stockings that were a bit more unique or charming . ( These are my favorites this year ) . If you 're looking for something new for your mantel or staircase , consider the ten unique and charming stockings below ! <p> Our current fav is Shameless , but after that hubby turns on The Crown . Were about six episodes in . I confess I spend more time looking at my iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any interest to me at all , its because its mostly true events , but it does n't  compare to Downton in my view . <p> I hope you 're feeling better today Kate ! Sending get well wishes up your way . Love all of those stockings especially the felt poinsettia and blue knit stockings . So hard to believe Thanksgiving and Christmas are just around the corner . <p> I 'm watching The Crown and I 'm on episode 5 . I 'm a Royal watcher so I 'm enjoying it . <p> But my favorite series this season is Good Girls Revolt on Amazon Prime . It is about a group of women working for a national news magazine in 1969 . They were not allowed to write the stories , only do the research , so they challenged the powers that be at the magazine . This is based on a real group of women at Newsweek. 23102 @qwx883102 
@@99058002 @3258002/ <h> Keeping a Gratitude Journal <p> By Kate Riley January 26 , 2015 <p> I used to keep a written journal when the children were babies , mostly about their little milestones since they were changing from week to week , but I stopped when I started blogging in 2009 , mostly because blogging was taking up most of my free time . I picked up that old journal earlier this year and read a few entries and thought I really should get back to journaling about more personal thoughts <p> I read Oprahs What I Know for Sure over the holiday break and in it she mentioned she keeps a gratitude journal with a daily list of five things to be grateful for and I thought to myself , what a great habit and one that is n't too time consuming . I bought a journal at Barnes &amp; Noble two weeks ago and started keeping notes of gratitude for myself , jotting down random things that happened to me that day that made me smile . <p> Everything we record these days is in digital or electronic form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the convenience of " there 's an app for that " so this my little way of rebelling against the movement to let technology do everything for us . <p> I think the daily habit of recording the happiness that comes from simple pleasures is a healthy one . The older I get the more I realize that the simplest things are the truest sources of happiness , time with your child , a conversation shared with a friend , a sweet treat enjoyed in stolen moments of relaxation , tulips in January , flannel sheets and a warm fire on a chilly winter day <p> Now that I keep this journal , Im find myself actively looking for things to be grateful for ( got ta have something to write down . ) There are always difficulties , stressful moments , and frustrations that come with each day , but staying focused on things that are good is a mindset that keeps me content , like a ray of sunshine peeking through the clouds . 23100 @qwx883100 <h> 33 comments <p> I think its easy to forget how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years I 've had a string of really bad things happen , one right after the other . When I started keeping a gratitude journal , I realized that I have been truly blessed throughout my life , even during the " bad " times and I no longer take any of the little positive moments for granted . I do have to say , though , that your little corner of your bedroom where you do your writing looks million times better than mine ! <p> Couldnt agree more . I have been doing counselling for 20 years , 10 of those with people facing terminal illness , and I firmly believe in the power of gratitude . I have seen people facing tragedy , and still able to count their blessings . Gratitude is powerful , and along with the handwritten word , it needs to make a comeback . <p> Bravo ! Thank you for posting your thoughts on the " Gratitude Journal . " This is something I 've been thinking about doing for a long time and no time like the present to start . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing ! I am thankful for your blog and appreciate you putting in the time it takes in order for others to enjoy ! <p> We have been struggling to get pregnant with our second child for over two years . I read Oprahs book and it has truly helped me get through some unbearable days . Rather than keep a journal , my husband and I say what we are grateful for right before we turn in at night . Gratitude is so , so powerful . I 'm glad you have found the practice helpful , too ! <p> This is a really lovely idea . Writing down what one is grateful for surely makes a little more sense of the world . I will join you Kate and buy a blank notebook today . It goes without saying that it must have a pretty cover . I kept a travel diary all my life until recently . As someone who travels , an awful lot and I mean an awful lot I kept a record of not just places , events , meals and accomodation but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example I was watching the squirrels play in the snow in Montreal one very cold winter day when I came to the rather sudden decision that when I got home I would resign my job and try something different . I wrote it all down when I got back to the apartment . Writing it down made it real and not a pie in the sky idea . I followed through when I got home and completely changed my life . To my my emmense disappointment I lost that diary in the floods that came through in 2011 . Not thinking to grab the book is my biggest regret from that time as so . So much me was written down in words . I have n't started another travel diary but will give the Gratitude Journal a go . <p> I love journaling and reflecting in writing about the good things that have happened to me has brought me through some terribly difficult times . I have a little twist on a gratitude journal to share with you ! I am always looking for meaningful gifts that do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed aside . A couple of years ago I decided that one thing I wanted to give my husband was gratitude . A quick thanks gets forgotten quickly . So I bought a stack of file cards and resolved to sit down every evening before lights out and jot down something that he had done for me that day that I was thankful for , no matter how seemingly insignificant . It is a true exercise in gratitude and has the added benefit of improving your relationship ! We all want to be appreciated and I noticed he has the cards on his night table and looks at them occasionally ! Why not get a little book and do this for someone you love ? <p> I use an app for this ! It reminds everyday to make an entry if I have n't already done so . I love being able to add a photo too . We see what we are looking for so the practice of keeping a journal of whatever sort is self-fulfilling . I have started keeping a handwritten journal of quotes I see online either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savor the quote when writing it by hand , I love cute notebooks and its lovely to have the notebook to flick through to retread them . <p> Its so easy to forget the little things that put a smile on our face , when swirling in a sea of negativity . Between work and shuttling two daughters around , Im frazzled and have a generally poor disposition as I 'm running around in the evening . I caught myself a week ago responding with a dismissive " eh " when someone I had n't  seen for awhile at my daughters dance studio asked how I was doing . that 's right eh ! What the heck is that ? So since then I 'm trying to be mindful of my attitude and take pleasure in the little things . Daughters remembered all of their dance shoes and did n't  bicker the entire drive to dance ? Score ! Cashier at my local coffee house with cool blue hair that I would totally rock if I was 20 years younger , happens to mention that she liked my earrings ? Score again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the best . Being grateful is a wonderful attitude to have every day . Thank you for that reminder ! <p> I 'm going to pick up a journal today and write down every good and perfect thing that happens to me , no matter how big or small . Over the last 6 months my familys financial situation has changed quite a bit and its taken all of my faith and patience not to complain . I cant even believe that I was even tempted to complain when my family can still eat 3 meals a day , have a warm home to sleep in every night , and we all have our health and strength . Yes , I am extremely grateful that things are as well as they are ! <p> I HAVE to start doing this ! I have read about this everywhere latelyits a sign ! : - ) They mentioned it at church this Sunday and how we forget answered prayers because we do n't  journal . It is encouraging to go back and read about answered prayers or kids milestones . Gratitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alison , that is a tragic loss . I love that you keep travel journals , I did that when I was in my twenties on a two month backpacking tour through Europe , and l you said it is such a treasure I 'm so glad I wrote down all the sights , sounds , smells they come back to me these years later . Good for you for writing down your life changing decision the act made it real . Thank you for sharing . Karin , what a great gift , to take it beyond a journal and make it verbal . Jules too funny , there really IS an app for that , ha ! ! ! You have such a great perspective Monika , thank you ( and everyone ) for sharing your wisdom ! <p> I 've recently been missing writing on real paper with a real pen , something that was so much a part of my life . Like for you , electronic word keeping has become the norm . I , too , have a brand new journal and slowly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand . <p> I have been doing my gratitude journal for at least 15 years.when Oprah profiled the writer of the book . It turned my life around and some of my family too . I really open my eyes and focus on the small things which make you appreciate the simplest gesture or blossom or an old couple holding hands . It is wonderful and therapeutic and makes you realize how we place too much importance on unimportant things or material objects . <p> Ive been following you for several years from South Carolina and I will have to say that one of my gratitudes is reading your blog . You made me smile today . You spoke such true words . I have been battling cancer for almost 4 years . I have filled 7 or so journals . I often go back and read some of my entries . Some of them are painful but I smile because I am alive and today is another gift from God . We have blessing upon blessing given to us every single day . They are all around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . A Carolina Wren sang his heart out to me yesterday morning . I stood at my kitchen window and listened to his melodious song for a long time . This morning we saw a gorgeous sunrise as we drove to the hospital . I 'm thankful and grateful that my eyes have been opened and nowI can see . Thank you , Lord ! <p> I love this idea . I found out recently that I am most likely going to lose on of my ovaries due to a ( benign ) mass and it has been devastating for myself and my husband . I have been feeling God pulling me to keep track of all the positives through this trial and I love the idea of a gratitude journal . On a side note I have that exact lamp in my bedroom from Target . I love it . <p> Love this idea ! I have kept a diary since I was a little girl but as I 've gotten older its become increasingly difficult to find the time . This is a great way to still journal but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps you to search for the little things we should be grateful for in the every day . Great idea ! <p> I love this post . I had been given a blank , lined pages , journal for my birthday this month and thought I should start a gratitude journal . Your post was the very shove I needed to do just that . Thank you so much . I agree , we all have little hiccups in life but staying focused on the good things helps me get past any not so great incident . xo , Karen 23102 @qwx883102

If you 're hosting no doubt you 're trying to remember one hundred other little things and the centerpiece is a last minute collaboration . No worries . The easiest way to keep it stress free is to keep it super simple . All natural is an easy approach , and does n't take more than a trip to the supermarket or a walk around your neighborhood to gather clippings from the great outdoors . <p> Keeping your setting simple and natural allows the food to shine and invites your company to linger longer over the meal .

@@99058015 @3258015/ <h> Easter Mantel + Link Party <p> By Kate Riley April 10 , 2011 <p> Hello hello , hope you all had a lovely weekend ! I realized on Friday I had advertised an Easter link party come Monday morning , then scratched my head wondering what I could pull out of my little bag of tricks . I admit , I was n't feeling very inspired , especially since we 're not hosting Easter dinner or an elegant brunch like we did last year . <p> What to do , what to do ? Drumming fingers , thinking thinking Hey , how about a switcheroo on the mantel , that 's always easy and fun , cause it 's only been a month since I last changed it ! Yeah , the mantel . Some fresh flowers and a few flea market finds from the past , and a new ( albeit simple ) mantelscape is on display . <p> I found the candlesticks below at a thrift store last year . I speculate they were donated because their stripes are not perfectly symmetrical , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Liberty of London ' feel , and were an easy buy at $5 dollars for the pair . <p> The candlesticks inspired the pastels not my favorite colors to decorate with , but acceptable for the Easter season . A simple glass jar filled with tempting chocolate morsels plays off the colorful botanical design . <p> I also made this butterfly bunting out of a fabric remnant and a vintage handkerchief I found at an antique store . <p> The bunting , although whimsical , was a little too girlish for my taste , especially with the mantel decorated in pastels . My daughter happily whisked it off to her bedroom where it is now strung across her window . <p> Those boy and girl busts were a lucky find at a flea market last year , they remind me of my two smallest children . I believe the most important thing when decorating your home is to surround yourself with the things you love , or put objects on display that remind you of who is special in your life . <p> Finally , I bent over backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . Only the brainiest dare attempt ! Step one : paint eggs . Step two : fling another color of paint across eggs . Wipe brow in sheer exhaustion at the complexity of this craft , then display in shredded tissue paper and call it a day . <p> . <p> What about you ? What Easter inspiration do you have to share today ? <p> Link up any of your Easter ideas , past or present , through this Thursday ( April 14th ) . <h> 56 comments <p> I *love* your bunting . You Americans are wayyyy better at flaggy type things than we Canadians . I did n't  even know it was called a bunting . I 've always called it a drapey , flag-type , swaggy thing . Its a mouthful . karen <p> Wow ! You have lots of fun , fun materials to play with ! The pastels are pretty with the white mirror . I esp . love the vase color . I needs more vases . Nice vases . I have crappy vases , but beautiful flowers from my gardens all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping ! <p> Love your mantel !

Ill be back to check out some links later todayI have to get the taxes to the tax guy today . I am the worst " book keeper " ever ! : s <p> Love the mantel , love the eggs , love the reflection of the paint-stick sunburst mirror ( on my absolutely must try list ) ! Thanks for hosting the link party looking forward to lots of Easter inspiration . <p> Hey Jeanette , if there were pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat pants , bed head and no makeup . Sexy ! No seriously , all I did was paint them that soft yellow , let it dry , water down some silver paint with a drop or two of water , dip my artists paintbrush , then fling it across the eggs with a flick of the wrist . Its best to try out the technique on a piece of newspaper before you paint the eggs . <p> Olivia , the mirror was a floor sample found at Lamps Plus that I painted white and turned on its side , but you can still find it on their website here : <p> What a great idea with the handkerchief bunting ! I see cute vintage hankies all the time in thrift stores and flea markets , and now I will be seeing them with new eyes : ) . Even if it ended up being a little too much for your mantel , I 'm glad for the idea ! <p> Such a pretty mantel ! I linked what I did for our mantel after the winter holidays . Its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle to the print on the left in this post , but its the best I can do this year . <p> I just wanted to take a second to thank you for all that you share and for allowing us all a space to do the same ! It is so lovely to be inspired by the many DIY-ers out there , so thanks for giving us a place to connect : o ) <p> Oh your mantle looks delightful ! I hope our next house has one . Thanks for the Easter link up party so many great ideas . I 'm not prepared with a project this week but now I have lots of ideas for next time ! ; ) <p> Your mantle is very pretty , Kate . Love the pink tulips of course , your egss are fun and the bunting is very delicate and sweet . I think your mantle has the perfect Easter touch . I think each time I walked by I 'd be taking a chocolate egg or two or three out of the jar . 23102 @qwx883102

I like to joke around and link to cool stuff on Twitter too . <p> My friends , after all that traveling in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete disaster . Absolute chaos is no exaggeration . I could n't see the floor , and anytime I moved something , I could see particles of dust floating through the air . The time had come to end the madness , I needed to purge ! Shoes , clothes and anything else that was dated , damaged , or never worn at all went out the door . <p> I found things in my closet I 'm embarrassed to mention . Things that have n't been worn by any member of this household in years . I 'm talkin ' pantyhose , swim diapers , flared trousers , and *ashamed to admit* post pregnancy velvet lounge pants . <p> By Saturday afternoon the closet was empty , the dust bunnies were gone , and I had rid myself of any embarrassing bad fashion . Then I looked at those walls , and got a crazy ( but typical ! ) idea . I decided I was tired of the brown shelving and wanted to paint them gray . Oh , and I also wanted the hint of perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Mister then told me I was crazy . <p> So then I reminded him that he had his own closet with brown laminate shelving off our bedroom and he could keep his brown shelves , fondle them , caress them and sing sweet love songs to them . As for me and my closet , we were going girly glam all the way . <p> Here is the perfectly fine and totally acceptable space , and I 'm sure that many of you will agree with my Mister , it 's a very nice spacious closet . <p> I envisioned something completely feminine , more like a boutique ! So I painted the shelves and the walls , switched out the chandelier , and refinished the jewelry chest too . Then I put only half my clothes back inside and I think I 'll just live that way forever . <p> Originally , I thought about this pink and gold wallpaper on the walls , but after considering the cost and the extensive and precise trimming required to install around all that shelving , plus the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and wait and wait and wait for the wallpaper to arrive while all my clothing was strewn everywhere , I took the simple route and opted for paint instead . Off I went to Benjamin Moore . <p> . <p> I chose Mellow Pink ' for the walls , and Pewter ' for the shelving , plus I added a clematis stencil in champagne and silver metallic paint , and scattered the whimsical stems around the space . <p> I 've painted laminate before , and like I mentioned here and here , the trick is to use the right primer . Oil based Zinsser has always worked for me , and it 's one of my paint closet essentials , so that 's how I covered up the brown laminate . <p> I use a foam roller for the easiest and quickest application . Do n't worry about perfection , just even coverage , and it 's OK to see traces of the color of the laminate underneath . <p> Once the primer was dry , I cracked open one of BM 's perfect grays called Pewter ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few holes in the rim helps drain your paint so it does n't collect in the lid . When you go to close your paint up , it makes for a cleaner seal ! <p> I also added 1 part metallic silver to 3 parts Pewter ' to give the gray a subtle shimmer and sheen . You can only see it up close , but its oh so purtay ! <p> Remember when I found that free chandy for my kitchen at Habitat for Humanity Restore ? I also happened to pick this one up too . A quick coat of white spray paint and a ceiling medallion adds a bit more glam to this closet space . <p> This jewelry chest I 've had for over ten years , it 's originally from the Bombay Company but I wanted a fresh look , so I painted it ! I 'll show you how I did it next week . <p> So that 's the quick tour of this new and improved space ! <p> I think I 'll add that extra shelf eventually ( where the stencil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and pretty space where I store my clothes ! <p> Few things feel better than a beautiful and well-organized closet and yours is certainly lovely . Unfortunately I missed you on the Nate show because the local news pre-empted all programming because of the snowstorm . Ill have to catch it in reruns . <p> Woman do you ever sleep ? ? ? How do you get this all done ? Its absolutely gorgeous and I want to LIVE in there . The stencil makes it . Just lovely Kate . And by the way I referenced your tutorial on painting laminate to paint shelves in my kitchen when I removed cabinetry and it worked like a charm . Thanks so much for all your inspirations . Congrats on the Nate appearance ! <p> I have one more day of having a dumpster in my driveway , and I know now where I need to gostraight into the belly of the beast ( aka my closet ) .

Can you come to my house now and re-do our closets haha . <p> Oh and I know the feeling about the expired bad fashion .

Those things , needless to say , went right into the trash . <p> Ive been trying to figure out what i want to do with my closet , i think you just gave me some great inspiration ! ! This is breath taking ! ! I absolutely love it ! : ) You have a lot of great ideas and I really enjoy them ! <p> Ohmigoodness this is UH-MAZ-ING .

Thanks for the inspiration as we start moving toward a " real " closet . <p> Brilliant what you did with the Bombay jewelry chest . I have something similar and would love to freshen it .

My jaw is on the ground and there is drool all over my keyboard ! Youve got the most beautiful closet EVER ! The metallic stenciling is the icing on the cake . Just beautiful , Kate ( as usual ) . Bet your hubby is jealous now and secretly wishing you 'd do something cool to his boring brown laminate shelving . ; ) <p> Kate , when you refinished the light fixture , did you just paint the ugly yellow cord and chain , or replace them ?

Keep up the great work , I have so many of your things starred for future reference and inspiration . <p> Your closet looks AMAZING ! ! ! I can not tell you how much your projects have inspired me . I took on my staircase railing last May because of your post ( although I took a different route as far as product used ) it turned out beautiful and I am so glad I did it . I also freshened up my boring laundry room with shelving and green paint . I have been inspired by your color schemesvery french country/shabby chic .

Just like last year ( and because it reminds me of my grandmother who always had the same ) I picked up another flocked tree at a local lot . Instead of a tree skirt , we placed it in a wine barrel for a rustic look . I 'm using up all of my red decor this year , so the tree is covered in various favorite ornaments and also bulbs and flourishes in crimson shades . <p> Wedged in the tree are several branches of red berries for color and contrast . <p> Also several scarlet birds with gorgeous plumes found on clearance after Christmas last year at Pier One . <p> Birch logs in a jingle bell bucket add more natural elements and nothing says Christmas more than the classic poinsettias . On the chair is one of the felt poinsettia pillows I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found at my local thrift store earlier this year for a few dollars <p> On the tree are many of our favorite ornaments , including some of the DIY versions I 've created over the years .

@@99058040 @3258040/ <h> A Thankful Banner <p> By Kate Riley November 12 , 2009 <p> This is the time of year where I ca n't help but feel thankful . Thankful for health , happiness , harmony , bounty , and beauty , good friends and a loving family . I 've always loved banners , especially ones created for birthdays or holidays . Yesterday , I gathered some simple craft supplies , and created my own banner to make a seasonal statement . <p> I also added a few other seasonal touches to the living room to set the mood for Thanksgiving . <p> This Thankful Banner is incredibly quick and easy to make , and a great rainy day afternoon activity to make with your kids or grandkids . <p> Spread glue on top of chipboard letters , then dip letters in colored glitter and allow to dry . <p> Next , cut your scrapbook papers in a shape just large enough to accommodate your chipboard letters . I used a brown background and a patterned piece on top , cut with scalloped scissors . Glue letters to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched in the corners . <p> Add a leaf to each ribbon as you connect the letters , then tie with a bow . <p> Display on your mantle or across a window . <p> I 'm pretending these two little golden birds are holding it up for me . <p> I never get tired of fall leaves " and I 'll use any excuse to decorate with them . <p> I like to temper the warm tones of golds and oranges with a cool color like teal blue . Across the room , I added some turquoise to my thrift store sideboard display . <p> I 've never been one to decorate with cornucopias before , but I was inspired this season to do so with some golden glittery fruits and pinecones . <p> I am thankful that someone donated this turquoise and gold compote to a thrift store so I could bring it home for $5 dollars . <p> One of my favorite things about welcoming winter is the abundance of citrus . These oranges and mandarins just pop in the blue compote I found at Marshalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty and I love the turquoise with the orange . I 'm thankful today for too many things to list but I would say that good health is one of the things at the top of my list today . <p> Kate , I made a thanksgiving banner today too ! Yours is so cute and colorful . I used mostly brown tones on mine since I have a lot of orange and red on my mantle . I love the blues mixed in with the fall colors . I have never considered that but it makes perfect sense . <p> Great idea for the mantel . We have a mantel that 's very similar . Ill have to pass this along to my wife . she may want to make something similar . BTWIve been following your site on OPCany chance you 'd like to swap links or guest posts ? <p> I am so grateful not to have to spend another fall/winter/spring in the cold . I 'm grateful everyday that I am here in this incredible state . I love the banner and have been looking for an excuse to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I love how you incorporate glitter . Its always so classy and not overdone . I am thankful for my kids . My 16 yr old daughter has had a couple of close calls this year , and she is such a wonderful daughter a true joy . First she nearly died before being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis this summer , and last month she was in a bus crash in Idaho on her way home from a marching band competition . Right now she is in Indianapolis competing in the Bands of America Nationals ! I am also thankful for this sweet , uplifting blog . I enjoy following your day-to-day entries . <p> I have SO much to be thankful for . So much . This is my favorite post in quite a while . I love the instructions for the banner .

I am one lucky chick ! ! Thank you , Kate ! <p> I just found your site about a month ago and have been reading it ever since ! I love your ideas . The cornucopia is done very well . Did you use foam inside or another medium to hold the fruit and pinecones together . I have glittered fruit and pine cones I think I 'll put one together . I have n't used my cornucopia for YEARS as it is OLD and DATED . I just pulled everything out of it a few years ago , threw the stuff away and the cornucopia has been in storage ever since . Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute little banner . I love how the little birds are " holding " in up .

Thanks for sharing and Happy Thanksgiving . <p> What a great and easy project and the little birds are perfect . I love , love it ! Your decorations are elegant and inspiring . the blue is surprising with the oranges , but looks so good ! Thank you so much for linking up to the Sharing Thanksgiving party ! ! ! <p> Sunday afternoon ( Nov 15 ) my second oldest daughter turned 21 , and she also left for Marine Boot Camp ! I spent the rest of the afternoon crafting your thankful banner . I free handed the letters , my colors did n't  turn out as great as yours , and I omitted the leaves and used raffia instead of ribbon . Basically I was using what I had on hand , except that I did buy orange ultrafine glitter . I was delightfully engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices could be better , my banner gives me joy to look at . <p> I should mention I am very inept at decorating , so it is odd that I even stumbled upon your blog .

The wonderful side effect is that you 've got my mind working on little improvements I can make around my home to beautify it . Thank you , Kate , for your inspiration , ideas , photos , and time ! <p> Looks beautiful ! I love your banner . I bought one on Etsy for Christmas , but I really should try to make another one . Not sure that I have the patience for measuring out the various individual background pieces though- seems to be time consuming !
