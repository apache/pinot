This is a bunch of backroom politics and I think everyone sees that , though nobody knows exactly what . 2 million dollars a year ( US ) is all they are saving by shutting the transmitters off and I think it shows callous disregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those in the Australian Senate , particularly those in the NT , should continue to push back . If they let up now , there is zero chance it will ever be restored . <p> In a country the geographical size of Australia , reliable radio signals during especially daytime hours eliminates FM signals and MW in many areas . Should there be data /satellite problems the elimination of comms services in much of remote Australia is lost , what does the Govt intend to do if this happens . SW services are reliable and a suprising number of us in far rural and remote areas have the knowledge that we can turn to and receive information pertinent to the situation at hand , fires , road closures , flooding etc all of which are regular ocurrences in this country . I do believe that the ABC current CEO and board have very little understanding of how many of us turned on our portables and vehicle SW radios every day to hear the news on Radio Australia . Sadly the vast majority of the people making these decisions ie ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major centers and coastal areas of the East and have no concept of life outside their cosy well accomodated electorates . Aroud 88-90% of Australia population live in the major metropolitan areas , one of the most urban populations in the world . Hence the lack of focus or consideration for those of us who live outside those areas . Rural/remote areas are generally outside the concept of most Australians and that leaves us outside of their understanding and consideration . Try telling a Sydney sider or a Canberran that they cant listen to a radio station during the day , Pfft outside their concepture ! Australia owes the Pacific and its remote population and travellers the benefit of a reliable radio service and a future disaster may find the Govt with its pants down relying on highly complex data/Sat/microwave systems . Our smaller great neighbour New Zealand with a considerably smaller economy than Australia has vowed to maintain its SW services to the Pacific out of consideration for its near neighbours .

In the 1980s I was one of those enterprising DXers , taking over publication of the Cascade Mountain DX Club ( CMDXC ) when a local hobbyist lost interest in producing it . <p> For a few years I found that creating a regular bulletin was almost as satisfying as DXing itself , and I went on to publish another local bulletin , DX/Northwest .

I received similar letters from him after each years April edition . I do n't  recall Bob ever being a member of the CMDXC , so I 'm not sure how he knew of the content .

A while back I was on the lookout for a second antenna , however at more than -250 , I could n't justify purchasing a second Wellbrook . Ultimately I splashed out on the Bonito Boni whip E-field wideband active antenna ( 20 kHz to 300 MHz ) and with a very compact form-factor suitable for DXpeditions/portable operation in general , the Boni whip definitely ticked all the boxes . Furthermore , with reasonable second and third order intercept points of +55 and +32.5 dBm respectively , the Boni whip , on paper at least , looked like a pretty good buy at around -100 . <p> - <p> Initial testing at home confirmed , perhaps not surprisingly that the Boni whip could not match the- SNR provided by the Wellbrook ALA1530 in a noisy , urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proven to be a truly excellent antenna away from the ubiquitous blanket of electrosmog at my QTH . Furthermore , it really is so compact , I simply- leave it in the car in- a small- flight case , with a portable and connectors etc. for ad-hoc listening sessions . Since returning- from my most recent trip to Brazil , I have had a chance to review my most recent catches with the Boni whip , some of which are realy pleasing and most definitely underline the excellent performance of this diminutive antenna . In particular , signals from Radio RB2 - on 11935 kHz and Radio Aparecida on 11855 kHz , both low power Brazilian stations , are testament to how sensitive the Boni whip is in an electrically quiet environment . Check out also the quality of longwave signals from Poland and the- Czech Republic- - simply amazing for such a physically short antenna . Finally , there 's a personal first from Lusaka , Zambia , Voice of Hope Africa on 13680 kHz .

I did however manage to copy a very nice signal from BBC Radio 5 Live on 693 kHz medium wave and Cha+ne 3 , from Tipaza , Algeria on 252 kHz the latter is a much more difficult catch back in the UK . Reception videos for these two signals also follow below and I have to say that given the very noisy environment , this was a pleasing result using the Etons internal ferrite antenna .

A few days later I found myself in Maplins again and there it was on the shelf at just under -40 , so I bought one . <p> I got back into shortwave listening about 18 months ago , after many years of inactivity whilst my poor Sangean ATS-803A rotted away in the garden shed and Sony ICF-7600G long-gone via eBay .

I even managed to hear ABC Northern Territories 4835 kHz on it once - simply amazing for a receiver under -30 . Given my extensive experience with the PL-360 and having learned the PL-310ET shared the same DSP chip , I was expecting the same , or at least very similar performance and the only real benefit to upgrading to the PL-310ET was the direct frequency access . - However , I was wrong about that ! <p> The brilliant Tecsun PL-360 got me back into shortwave radio for less than -30 <p> About a week after buying the PL-310ET , - I managed to get out on a DXpedition and with 30 metres of wire attached to it via the external antenna socket , I started tuning around the SW bands . Quite simply , I was amazed at the sensitivity and selectivity of this diminutive little portable .

Someone with vision and backed with money could probably create a very listenable shortwave station , that with time and excellent programming , be quite renowned . I know the naysayers will say its been tried already , shortwave is dying .

RadioShack has always been known as the place for answers to the American publics technology and electronics questions . " Youve got questions , we 've got answers . " <p> Over the years , RadioShack introduced consumers to exciting and affordable gadgets and electronics that have become household items . As we cleaned out our historic archives in Fort Worth , Texas , we uncovered a cache of iconic memorabilia in 12 huge safes , including : unused original TRS-80 Microcomputers , Realistic Transistor Radios , Tandy computer software games , original brick cell phones and so much more . We all remember coming into RadioShack whether it was for the battery-of-the-month , new walkie-talkies , or to check out the newest RC toy cars . Now we reintroduce many of those nostalgic items and more with our rolling online memorabilia auction . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of these new-in-box/unused RS items .

Someday , I plan to hook it up and show my kids what a proper volatile memory meantturn it off and the memory is wiped clean ! I remember- how revolutionary the cassette tape wasit changed my world ! <p> No doubt , these RS offerings will fetch top dollar . Even though its still early in the auction , many items already have a rather high price and all of them have a soft closing : <p> " The closing time of this lot will be extended by 2 minutes if a bid is placed on this lot in the last 2 minutes .

Thing that we never saw because they were prototypes that evolved or never gone to production would be real treats . Though with previous gutting , they may have gone before . I gather that when Radio Shack sold off its computer division , a lot was shovelled out then , no consideration to history . <p> There is no market value . Auctions are always known for their over inflated prices . None of the items have any museum value . Now like let 's say Braun designs from Dieter Rams , SONY products from between 1955 and 1979 that were innovating , original RCA , Philips pre-1990 , Telefunken , and so on . <p> The prices are like that of eBay . You bring any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no historical value .

Auctions are a part of that market mechanism whether you chose to believe it or not . <p> Imagine that , selling trash . What a nostalgia trip .

Here in California I get AIR well enough to have it as a preset on my RS dx-392 . I have heard DRM radio needs a certain level of signal to be able to decode and play , like the move from analogue to digital in TV , you get either all or nothing . <p> Hopefully they will continue analog broadcasts to North America , simply because we do n't  have any commercial DRM receivers aside from SDR apps . Were also so far from India that the signals are never really that great , especially over in the east coast region where I live ( Alabama ) . I can occasionally hear their English broadcasts OK , but have never gotten more than a text display from their two-channel DRM broadcasts in the afternoon . If the signal is coming from the west , though , I would think Californians would have little trouble decoding the audio with a sufficient setup . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

Whether you 're looking for reviews of shortwave portables , tabletops , SDRs , or professional- receivers , our site offers a rich treasury of curated information to help you find the right radio for your needs , to compare modelsor just to learn about the unique world of radio , both past and present . <p> SWLing.com Our original site , - SWLing.com offers a simple , straightforward primer on how to effectively purchase and use a shortwave radio . Best of all , it has a popular Radio Reviews page that lists the best portable and tabletop shortwave radios on the market . The reviews , which focus on the effectiveness and usability of each model , are written in simple language for the benefit of those just starting in the hobby , who may not yet know the technical jargon , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions and definitions are provided . <p> The Shortwave Radio Index At the SWRI we have curated an index of all shortwave radios currently on the market . That 's right , all of them . We add new models each week as they come on the market . - The site is searchable by manufacturer , model , or type of radio . Each entry contains features and specifications of the radio with links to reviews on other sites , to retailers and resources for each model . This exhaustive index took some time to construct ; as such , we continue to put a great deal of time into maintaining it . As with all our sites , this is a free resource for you to use and share . <p> What 's more , you can contact us directly for specific instruction or advice. - In your email , keep descriptions brief , and questions and comments clear ; this makes it easier for us to help. - Please note that we receive a lot of email , so do allow a few days for a response . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review how- we acquire review units . While most of the radios and equipment are purchased directly for the review , occasionally , manufactures give us review samples or loaners . This typically happens when the product cost is excessive , a new product has been launched ( and were receiving a pre or first production unit ) and/or the review unit is not one the reviewer wishes to add to their own inventory . <p> When we indicate a " loaner " were referring to a review unit that has been sent to us on loan . We typically keep these radios for the length of time it takes to complete a review , then we send the unit back to the manufacturer at our own cost ( though sometimes the manufacturer pays return shipping ) . <p> When we indicate a " sample " were referring to a review unit that has been sent to us at no cost and the manufacturer does not want the unit returned to them . <p> We actually prefer loaner review units since it eliminates what could be perceived as a conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , many manufacturers- find it a hassle to issue loaner units on products that are relatively low costits cheaper for them to simply send it as a sample . Quite often we request a loaner , but are sent samples and do n't  discover this until the unit is received . <p> What do we do with samples after the review ? Sometimes we keep them in inventory if they can be used as a benchmark for future comparison . Most often , though , we give them away shortly after the review . <p> To be clear , no matter how we acquire a radio or accessory for review , we always endeavor to provide our most accurate assessment ; our integrity is more important than any piece of equipment . <p> Thank you for visiting , and please send feedback if you have suggestions on how to improve any of our sites .

I want one with knobs . my present receiver is an icom-R75. in advance i thank you for your time . P.S. there is nothing available in the United Stateswhat ever i find ( with your help ) will need to be shipped to me . <p> I wish I had an easy answer for you . The only effective DRM receivers at present are ones tied to PCseither IF receivers ( like the RadioJet ) or an SDR ( like the Papp radio , Perseus , Excalibur , RFSpace products , etc . ) . <p> I know of no all-in-one radios with build-in DRM decoding that really work . The portbale UniWave ( no longer in production ) and Newstar DR111 are only good at receiving very strong signals . Both radios review fairly poorly . I do have some hope that the Chengdu Newstar DR111 may get some upgrades that improve its performance . Keep checking back . Also check out the DRM website : http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for does not exist at present . Thanks for the question ! <p> Yes . As you said no built in receiver at present . But DRM.ORG is making strenuous effort world over for its expansion . None of the big players have come forward to produce receivers at affordable prize . Here in India DRM transmission hours are increased without receivers available to test . <p> I lost my Grundig YB 400 ( or was it a YB350 ? ) in a recent burglary and I 'd like to replace it . Ive been searching for reviews of SW radios in the $75 to $125 range . Can you make a recommendation or two ? Size is a small consideration for me as I travel with my SW , mostly camping in remote parts of Baja California . The dimensions of my YB400 were pretty much ideal for me . Thanks . <p> I am similar to yourself and do a fair bit of travelling and previousl owned the Grundig yb400 and have replaced it with the Tecsun PL660 which is a great all round set suitable for travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike ; You might wish to look at a DEGEN 1103 or Kaito equivalent with a collapsible fiberglass mast for antenna mounting . I 've had mine for 4 years and can attest to its lifespan for a sub $100 receiver . Batteries are rechargeable from standard power source , but do n't  over-charge them or they 're gone ( been there , done that ) . When it does ( rarely ) get confused , just stick a pin in the reset button and all is well with the world again . <p> I am in India . Many major sw broadcasters faded away I still likes sw services who ever are still on the air . I would like to buy a receiver in range of $100 to 150 . Can anyone suggest a set which should be DRM ready . <p> In Tecsun radio 2010D , as the analog dial has different dial spreads for FM 1,2&amp;3 , so that analog and digital readouts match . My querry is , then they ought to have similar different dial spreads for AM 9/10 kHz steps ( one for 522-1620 &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial readings when step is 9 kHz on 520-1710 scale , wont it ? <p> I would agree with Thomas . I am able to listen All India Radio(Hindi) using Tecsun pl-660 and Kaito 321 ( you need patience to tune in Kaito though ) . I was getting decent signal for these 2 here in central Connecticut . <p> Do n't  throw it away they are worth Money even if in need of repair ! There is a Yahoo group for the 2010 , join it , I believe there is some often mentioned who fixed 2010s , and he is very well recommended . <p> Hi there Joe.If you are having any problems with your ICF 2010/2001D or any Sony vintage portable receiver , I can point you in the right dirrection.They can be the most complicated radio to work on if you are not experianced.Dont worry I have a 2001D in peices right now ! ! So if you are living in the USA , get in touch with Rod Wallberg.Hes the expert and hell see you right.In fact he reads these messages , so I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Has anyone had any experiance with the Sangean ATS 909 ? I see the new ATS 909X is out now , but reveiws are not so good campareing it with the receiption of the Tecsun PL660 etc.But with the Sangean one difference is that it has the " Radio Data System " . Is this on all frequencies , or just on the FM band ? If anyone can give a reveiw of the ATS 900 that also has this system , please do so.I need to know if the older ATS 900 is still current and stocked , also how good is the SSB receiption , and how is the filtering against strong broadcast stations clipping in on arround 3 mgs to 7 mgs.I once had the 505 model and strong AM broadcast stations clipped in arround those frequencies.Anyway happy to find out all about the ATS 900 . Not the ATS 909X . Maybe someone could put it on You Tube aswell.Thanks . <p> I wrote about my Sony SW 55 a few months ago , giveing up on me , and there were comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and buy the Sangean ATS 909X to replace it , and yes its a truely wonderfull radio , I simply can not fault it.But getting back to my Sony SW 55 . It must be arround 20 years old I suppose , I used it nearly every day , the 500 memory bank was full of Utility SSB stations , it was always nice to hear the old Sony in action right up untill it died a sudden death with no warning.It simply would not turn on any more.So like many others I just put it down to dried up capacitators.Well since then , I 've tried to get it going , by plugging it into the Wall power supply , pressing the " on " button , but no , it just wont turn on.Then , today after it was sitting in my closset for a lenght of time , with no batteries in , I decided to have yet another try.But no it would n't turn on.So I started pressing the aray of many buttons it has on the front panel.I would hold different buttons in , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got to the " Sleep " button.Well to my supprise , pressing that Sleep button , and the On button at the same time , it acturly turned its self on.I was really amazed , that the old dead Sony SW 55 sprung into life , with full volume.I pluged in my outside antenna , and there were all my old stations , coming in as if it had never died.I do n't  want to turn it off now , so I plan just to keep it turned on for as long as possible.If I turn it off , who knows , it may never come on.So now , what about thoughs dried up caps ? I 've veiwed You Tube demos of how to change the caps for new ones because of the well known problem , of drying caps with this model , causeing the very problem I had.But its operating for now , as if it had never died.Has anyone else had this happen with their Sony SW 55 ? Unless there is a Ghost in side it maybe ? Maybe I awoke it ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . I 'm not sure why youre getting power on with that key combination . Its most likely not dried caps if it powers on and sounds fine ( unless a cap is the reason the normal " power on " sequence does n't  work ) . Somethings amiss , that 's for sure . If you have an experienced electronics technician nearby , you might want to consult them and take the schematic . I bet this can be properly fixed for the long term . <p> Yes Thomas , Its still running , even now as I write this ! ! I 'm too afraid to turn it off.I have installed new batteries to back up the computer , but its pluged into the wall power supply.I think pressing that " Sleep " timer button was just a " Fluke " . I did take it appart and taped all the caps lightly , but made no difference.Now its going after sitting in my closset.Maybe I awoke the ghost ha ha . So for now , SONY did make excellent portable SW/Gen coverage receivers back in their day.The old SW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as sensitive as it ever was.Full marks for SONY.Seeing and hearing is beliveing ! ! <p> The old Sony Sw 55 has gone back to sleep ! ! . I decided after three days of non stop operation , on many different utility stations , enough was enough ! ! I just had to turn it off and give it a rest.But , I was n't sure if it would power up again.I had my douts.Yes my douts were true.Yet again , it has died.It could be faulty caps.So many have noted this with their own , having to replace them , to keep the old Sw 55 going.Well this time I think I shall just leave it in the closset , in its cover , with batteries out , and work my Sangean 909X.The Sony sw55 did always have very " quivery " SSB.But other than that , it was a great radio with its station labeling , and many other features , well ahead of its time.I still treasure it , it was one of my first ever portable SW radios coming away from radios like the Halicrafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of very early AM portable transistor radios.Some Ive refurnished.I find them at markets and op shops.I enjoy collecting them , cleaning them up and getting them going again.Does anyone have the same hobby ? I would enjoy any comments please . <p> I was wondering if you could add the receive sensitivity to your radio reviews <p> Many of the radios yall review are indeed very nice and have a lot of bells and whistles , which is all well and good but adding the actual lab speced recive sensitivity would give us some insight into performance <p> Example : <p> My SDR Dongle is fine and has neat features and what not but my Yaesu FT101zd MKII blows the doors off of it when it comes to performance <p> The SDR-Dongle has a nominal input impedance of 75 Ohms I feed this to a 950 ' OCF Dipole 65 feet off of the ground with 600Ohm " Ladder Line " and a 8:1 Current Balun and 75ohm Coax Ground Conductivity , is in the region if 1200-1500Ohms <p> At 24 to 1000 mHz the Receive Sensitivity floats around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but for $20 who 's bitchin right ( he MDS at 3dB-ish , ( just guessing here ) and of course poor Image Rejection and internal signals are prevalent ( Birdies ) and I think it is a direct conversion receiver , Intermod , Aliasing , Compression , Harmonics all that crap <p> But to my point <p> If this was a $200 rig instead of $20 flash drive with these specs I would have gotten screwed <p> Now of course Amateur equipment ( like my 101 , or my Icom ) comes with a lot more info and sec sheets I get that and yall do n't  have a lab or time to fool with signal generators and scopes <p> But maybe just a heads up , from the manufacturer , on some specs for S/N or Receive Sensitivity <p> Maybe yall already do this and the reviews I read were just cherry picked <p> If so I apologize <p> Maybe something easy like slapping that new rig on WWV or WWVH and compare it to something else <p> I do n't  have the equipment to do proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the past , if hed be interested in testing some of the portables I review .

I live in a metal sided and roofed house.I have a 50 ' long wire antenna and a short pole antenna out along my eve.I have had them up there about as long as I owned my yb 40pe , which I bought from universal radio when they first were available.my questions ? 1 I run my pl 880 on normal setting and if I find a weak station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my 880 ? My yb 40 pe worked all those years and never had a problem.its wearing out keyboard is going bad , cleaned it but its used . 2 question have anybody tried wrapping stranded copper bare wire around a 20 ' piece of pvc making a tall antenna for shortwave with the goal of reaching above a new shed beside my house ? Must say am is great even in my house.its pulling in more than the yb ever did and lots better shortwave.fm is about equil on both radios.but my yb always did greatt on fm . 2 weeks ago I took my tecsun out in the yard and it really did great in am , fm , and shortwave using its stick antenna . I was almost afraid to buy a tecsun , I was always a grundig person.sadly I bought a s 450 dlx bad move shoulda read reviews . <p> greenmp1949@gmail.com Hi , I am new into SWLing and I live in a nursing home here in Adelaide and I want to go into SWLing and I am looking at spending no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a battery operated DIGITAL receiver that does side band and goes from about 3 kilohertz to about 30 megahertz ?

Regardless of what you think of DRM , its not actually a solution <p> For the top end of Australia , shortwave is particularly essential due to huge distances between towns , massive cattle stations , fishing boats out to sea , the threat of cyclones on the coast and bushfires inland that can take out FM transmitters . Lenghty power outages due to natural disasters are n't  an issue with SW either , since the SW transmitter can be in a location where electricity security is guaranteed . <p> Even in Southern Australia I 've been to many rural locations where shortwave signals are much stronger than medium wave , especially during the day . <p> Interesting to note that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Australia operate and maintain ( through Kordia ) an HF network for maritime communications from two remote sites in the Australian outback . Whilst not a broadcast service , if we took the ABC argument that " nobody is listening to SW " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones would be used more ( international safety obligations is the answer ) . <p> RA wo n't return in its previous format ( the sale of the Shepparton TX site seals that ) but a form may return via the NT service ( unless they have sold that as well ? ) <p> Unless those those against the cut can show how many people were listening it is n't going to happen . The ABC provided the the chair of the hearing figures for both RA and the NT service . And its only a handful . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207023 @3907023/ <p> Like Clint , I own the original non-Executive version of the Satellitsince performance is identical , I 'm not going to " upgrade " to the Executive version ( though I do really like the executive case ) . <p> After Clints review in February , I stated taking the Satellit with me on travels more often and have been most pleased with its performance . While it took me a while to get used to its amber display at night , I must say- it is a fantastic performer , has superb built-in audio and is overall a wonderful full-featured radio travel companion . <p> I often forget to mention- the Satellit when readers ask for portable radio recommendationsperhaps this is because the Tecsun PL-880 simply overshadowed it in my mind . - Not anymore . <p> RTC , I recommend you rather consider the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews that have been posted more recently , plus watch a number of Oxford Shortwave Logs ( Clint Gouveias ) Youtube videos of the Eton Satellit in action . This Satellit has been substantially improved since its initial introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very happy with our current-production Satellits . We have not found QC issues , except for some minor paint wearing on the Executive model . <p> The DXing performance is most impressive , and in the same league with the Panasonic RF-B65 and Sony ICF-2010 . Here is one of Clints more recent DX comparisons with the Eton Satellit . Take a listen and decide for yourself if the radio is worthwhile : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=SsGjdmYRup8 <p> Does the Satellit still sound slightly choppy when tuning during the actual process of DXing ? The recent videos only show the Satellit sitting on a frequency . I remember older videos when the muting feature during tuning and searching made it very difficult to notice broadcasts when searching through a band with any kind of speed . <p> My Eton Satellit is a newer version , and the soft mutingalthough still present on MW &amp; HF in AM modeis not a bother to me at all . In SSB mode soft mute is completely absent . The radio performs so well for its size and price in other regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute to be a deal breaker . <p> Jay Allen explains it well : As of September , 2015 the newest production run of the Eton Satellit has reduced the muting while tuning which the original release had which now makes band scanning much more enjoyable . It is completely disabled during SSB mode which is good news . On SW the new version has almost no muting at all and it therefore band scans very nicely . On AM it is still a bit intrusivethe audio is not totally muted but it is lowered in volume during tuning so if you can hear what you are passing by . Again its not as nice as on SW but it is improved over the earlier version . Although not ideal I can live with it because the actual reception on AM is better on the Satellit than any of the other current production mid-sized radios I 've compared it with . <p> Got an original Satellit last Summer on amazon.com , since here in Europe I can not find a reseller .

@@75207024 @3907024/ <h> Site menu : <h> Finding Shortwave Stations and Broadcasts <p> Searching for an FM radio station on your car radio is quite easy . The reason is , no matter what time of the year it is , no matter what the space weather ( yes , I said space weather ) or conditions of the ionosphere are--FM stations are relatively few , local , and always broadcast in the same spots on the FM dial . <p> Shortwave stations , on the other hand , are many and are affected by the ionosphere , space weather , atmospheric conditions , and the sun spot cycle . That 's a lot of variables , right ? No worries : shortwave broadcasters have worked around these conditions for decades and know them quite well . That 's why they schedule their broadcasts to take full advantage of these conditions to reach their target audience . With just a little skill , you 'll know when and where to listen in order to hear your selection . <p> Before you look at schedules and frequency listings , if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the difference between Kilohertz and Megahertz and how to use your frequency display . If you already understand the difference between mHz and kHz and how to find frequencies on your radio , then skip to broadcasting schedules ! <p> The World Radio and TV Handbook is a fantastic broadcast schedule resource , but to understand listings , you need to undertand how to read shortwave frequencies in both kilohertz and megahertz formats . <h> Reading Frequencies and Your Radio Dial <p> Shortwave radio displays usually come in two types : digital and analog . I always recommend that newcomers purchase a radio with a digital display ( and , preferably , with a keypad for direct frequency entry ) if they do n't already have a radio . That 's the reason why you wo n't find an analog display on my recommended radios page . However , if you 're reading this article because you want to learn how to use dad 's old tabletop shortwave radio , or you already have a small portable receiver with analog display , fear not ! After you understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , you will figure out the dial in short order . <h> Understanding Radio Frequencies <p> In almost all guides to shortwave listening , frequencies are given in kilohertz ( kHz ) . Sometimes , though , websites and broadcasters themselves may announce their frequencies in megahertz ( MHz ) . What 's the difference between the two ? Only three decimal places . <p> It 's really simple to tell the difference ... look at these two examples : <p> 3.917 MHz = 3917 kHz <p> Say , someone gives you a listing in Megahertz--like the example above , 3.917 MHz . To make it into a kHz frequency , simply move the decimal 3 places to your right . There you have it ! 3.917 MHz = 3917 kHz . <p> Sometimes this may require adding zeros , as in the example below . <p> 15.5 MHZ = 15500 kHz <p> One quick glance at this digital display and you know you 're on 9,580 kHz or 9.58 MHZ ( your author 's favorite spot to listen to Radio Australia ) . <p> All I did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decimal 3 places to the right , which meant I had to add 2 zeros to the end of the number . 15.5 MHZ = 15500 kHz <p> If given a frequency in Kilohertz , you only have to move the decimal place over 3 digits to the left to turn it into a frequency in Megahertz . For example : <p> 9740 kHz = 9.740 MHz17830 kHz = 17.830 MHz <p> It 's just that easy . <h> Stick with Kilohertz <p> By and large , though , shortwave broadcast frequencies will be given in kHz . Think of your car radio . In the US , there are two so-called bands , AM and FM ( AM and FM are not really bands , by the way ; they are modulations-- amplitude modulation and frequency modulation--but we wo n't discuss that here ) . Your AM display typically shows frequency in kHz . That 's because 630 kHz , for example , would be .630 MHz--not as simple , is it ? To give someone the frequency , you need to say " Point six three zero Megahertz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Six thirty " . <p> To use a more dramatic example , your FM dial--without exception--shows frequency in MHz . That 's because 102.7 MHz would be 102700 kHz . Imagine how big the radio display would have to be to accommodate all of those extra zeros ! And just imagine how much longer station identification would take : " You 're listening to the greatest hits on one hundred two thousand seven hundred Kilohertz ! " <p> Same thing with the SW bands . It just sounds better in Kilohertz . Indeed , the only time you may hear someone give you a frequency in Megahertz is if it 's easier to say in Megahertz . For example , to tell you where to locate WWV in Fort Collins Colorado , I may say , " Check 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 Megahertz " . That 's because it 's easier to say than , " Check 5000 , 10,000 , 15,000 and 20,000 Kilohertz . " <p> If you 're an amateur in the field , until you 've cruised the bands for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a SWLing friend of yours calls with a pirate radio frequency and is in a hurry , they may call , " Check fifty seven sixty five , " ( for , say , 5765 kHz ) and may not bother saying " Kilohertz " . <p> We 've been talking about frequencies across the radio spectrum . In fact , even though we 've mentioned shortwave frequencies and the AM and FM segments on your car radio dial , we 've only discussed a tiny portion of the radio spectrum . It 's not within the scope of this website to talk about the entire spectrum , but if you 're interested to see how the US , for example , allocates radio spectrum , take a look at this large downloadable chart . <p> Now let 's actually look up some broadcasting schedules . <h> Broadcasting Schedules <p> There are several ways to find broadcasting schedules . Thanks to the advent of the internet , online resources are typically the cheapest , most accessible way to find schedules . <p> Online resources <p> The most intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look up broadcast schedules by station , frequency or what is currently on the air . This is a new site , but has done an excellent job of keeping schedules up-to-date so far . <h> Printed SWLing Guides - The World Radio and TV Handbook <p> I am a firm believer in the convenience of having a printed guidebook to the shortwave bands . The WRTH is very comprehensive and jam-packed with frequency listings and information . There is a small learning curve to use this book , but once you 've referenced a few frequencies , you 'll be an expert . Plus , there is a helpful user 's guide at the beggining of the book . One browse through WRTH 's list of features and you 'll see why people who are serious about SWLing , DXing , Terrestrial TV and Local Broadcasting keep a copy of WRTH nearby . <p> Receiver reviews <p> Coverage of current SWLing topics <p> National radio section covers the world 's domestic radio services . Listings are by country and include all stations broadcasting on LW , MW and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with contact details . <p> International radio section provides a full , comprehensive listing of SW broadcasters and clandestine stations <p> TV section has details of the main terrestrial national broadcasters , large regional networks , and some local stations , arranged alphabetically by country . <p> Reference section has tables and listings of : International and Domestic Transmitter sites , Standard Time and Frequency Transmissions , DX Club information , International Organisations , and other essential information . <h> Other sources of SWLing information <p> There are many other SWLing guides and frequency listings out there . Below , I list a few of my favorites that I think are especially useful for beginners : <p> Glenn Hauser 's World Of Radio Glenn Hauser is the " Yoda " of shortwave listening . His World of Radio shows are informative and highlight all of the current activity and news reported on the SW bands . If you listen to his show and seek some of the interesting stations and broadcasts he mentions , it 's likely that you will become addicted to SWLing . This show keeps its finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Okay , you may be able to tell that I 'm a huge fan of GH .

Also , full text versions of his shows are available here . That said , I still prefer finding his show on the radio and listening to it . It 's much more fun ! <p> Speaking of fun , is n't it time to get out that radio and find some stations ? If you have n't already chosen a radio , I suggest a few on this page .

I will give it a good go this winterperhaps conditions will surprise me and theyll rise above the noise floor for a few minutes . <p> I 'm very curious if any listeners in Newfoundland or the Maritimes can hear the Forecast on longwave . <p> There 's nothing impossible for the LW and AM spread in autumn and winter time . I recently heard Turkmenistan on LW , China and Korea on Broadcast at a local station level , both are thousands miles away from my QTH . You should keep listening , Thomas , I 'm pretty sure it may be heard in the States , East Coast at least . <p> And not only the shipping forecast will go but also " Sailing By " too a lovely tune to listen to on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BBC madness cutting off the last of our possibilities of we long-range British Radio 4 listeners in Europe . I for one really enjoy listening to Radio 4 throughout the day with its crackles and whistles filling my living room- and have done so all my life since listening on my childhood-days own-built crystal set radio . Not only does it give real , live broadcast effects , but it also let 's me know of impending thunder storms as the static crackles become louder . You cant get this " live-feeling " on the Internet . <p> You 're right . As quoted , " A spokesman for the BBC said they were no firm plans to end long wave broadcasting , and no date set for when the technology could run out . " <p> With that said , we know the trend is for the closure of longwave and with the budget cuts the BBC are facing , its a real possibility . RTE and Radio France have already started the process . <p> I think , however , that the British public may very well put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longwave as well . This article is a case in pointa warning of what seems to be coming down the pipeline . The Shipping Forecast is such an institution and universally loved , it may survive in the long run . At least I hope so . Time will tell . <p> Its actually an old story floated about some time ago , in almost exactly the same format . I guess at least it has reminded everyone that BBC R4 LW still exists , an free advert for it . <p> Whilst its true that many other LW stations have closed , they have been in countries where they do n't  need things like shipping forecasts , or programming opt-outs for tennis or cricket , or already have other methods of providing industry teleswitching which R4 LW provides , as well as a frequency standard . <p> So I think the UK has more of a use for it . The highlands of Scotland are not covered by FM too well , neither is Wales . <p> But I think there could be a little more use made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its potential . <p> After all , I am as much a dx listener / radio fanatic as I am a general " consumer " of programming , which of course usually makes sense to listen on FM . <p> Also , to be clear , the Shipping Forecast is n't only transmitted on LW . There are four forecasts each day at 00:48 , 05:20 , 12:01 , and 17:54 local time . Only the 12:01 version is broadcast only on LW . The 17:54 version is transmitted only on LW on weekdays but on the weekend it is transmitted on both FM and LW . The other two , including the late-night version , are broadcast on both FM and LW . <p> But , if Radio 4 LW were to be shut down and no other changes were made , then in addition to some Shipping Forecasts the followed would go ( caution ; from Wikipedia ) : " Yesterday In Parliament at 0835 " 0900 on Tuesdays to Fridays , The Daily Service at 0945 " 1000 on Mondays to Fridays , the Shipping Forecast at 1201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays , and Test Match Special during international cricket games " . <p> In addition to the live radio transmissions , the Shipping Forecasts can be heard via the Internet in the Radio 4 live streams and on demand . <p> The Wikipedia article on the main Radio 4 LW transmitter site at Droitwich says : " However , since March 2014 the BBC is doing works in the transmitter that result in a very weak signal reception in Europe . As of March 2015 , the reception of BBC4 LW 198 kHz is still very poor and difficult , even in the countries next to the UK in continental Europe . " Does anyone know if the transmitter work has been completed ? <p> I recorded the late-night version of the Shipping Forecast last night using the SDR at the University of Twente and will submit the recording to the Shortwave Radio Audio Archive shortly . <p> Shutting down the BBC Radio 4 LW transmitter on 198 kHz might also affect how the U.K. responds to a nuclear attack .

@@75207047 @3907047/ <h> Review of the Kaito KA 500 Self-Powered Radio <p> I tested the KA500 along with several other self-powered radios for a project I 'm working on in Africa . I found that the KA500 is a very capable shortwave receiver its just not nearly as rugged as its current competitors . Here are my thoughts : <p> What I like about the KA500 : <p> Solar Panelthe KA500 is one of the only portable shortwave receivers out there with a built-in solar panel . The panel is effective enough that it will power the radio ( if in direct sunlight ) without batteries and produce a reasonable amount of volume through its built-in speaker . <p> The 5 LED reading lamp This reading lamp is impressive . If the batteries are fully charged , the lamp works for VERY long periods of time . I 'm also an amateur radio operator and found that the reading lamp is bright enough that it lit up my large radio table . <p> Good shortwave sensitivity For a self-powered analog radio , I was impressed with the shortwave sensitivity . I also found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selectivity When a station is tuned-in well , you do n't  often hear adjacent signals . <p> Good frequency coverage I like the fact that KA500 covers the NOAA weather frequencies , FM , AM and a very large portion of the SW spectrum ( from 3.2 MHZ to 22MHz , missing only a little used piece between 8 &amp; 9 MHz ) <p> What I did n't  like : <p> Quality Though the radio feels solid in your hand , I found through my testing that the quality of the KA500 is actually quite poor . More than once , the tuning mechanism would slip and the needle would get stuck in the middle of the dial . The worst part , though , is the poor quality of the hand-crank mechanism . The dynamo and crank arm feel cheap . Well , they are cheap . After only a month of occasional testingand with me being very careful with the hand crankthe dynamo started showing signs of failing . The crank became less fluid to turn and would rub the side of the radio chassis . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half . No more crank power . <p> No Fine Tune control Kaito fits the whole SW1 and SW2 spectrum on a small dial . There were a few times I wish this radio had a fine tune control like the Grundig FR200 . <h> Bottom line <p> I sent my KA500 back and did not get it replaced . Its a shame , really . I loved the radios features and overall performance , but was very disappointed with quality . <p> I could only recommend this radio to someone who plans on tucking it away and using it on rare occasions or someone who wants a basic full-featured radio but never plans on using the hand-crank . I 'd also keep the receipt handy for the return ( and buy from an authorized dealer like Universal Radio ) . <p> For my purposes , I will be using the Grundig/Et+n FR350 and the FR200 . The difference in quality between these and the KA500 is night and day . The Grundigs/Et+ns are very rugged , water resistant and time tested . The crank arms are made better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're simply designed and tested better ( before hitting the retail shelf ) . <p> Sure wish Kaito would work on the quality of the KA500 , theyd have a very competitive product . <p> Update 8/11/10 : Since the time I first published this review , Et+n now makes self-powered radios with built-in solar panels along with hand cranksthe FR600 is a fine example. - I have not noticed that the quality of the KA500 has been improved upon. 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207060 @3907060/ <h> Review of the Alinco DX-R8T tabletop shortwave receiver <p> Last year , when I saw the announcement that a new tabletop radiothe Alinco DX-R8Twas about to hit the market , I almost fell out of my chair . <p> The Alinco DX-R8T tabletop shortwave receiver <p> A new tabletop on the market ? Could it be true ? Over the past few years , many long-time manufacturers have dropped out of the shortwave tabletop market , while newer , smaller manufacturers have been popping up in the SDR ( Software Defined Radio ) market . SDRs are greata lot of performance for the pricebut to listen to the radio , you have to turn on your computer , launch a program , and typically , do things to isolate any noise your computer may generate . <p> A tabletop , on the other hand , simply requires that you turn it on : - instantly , its there , awaiting tuning . <p> Obviously , I was eager to try out the DX-R8T . Fortunately , the good folks at GRE America ( the US distributor for Alinco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for SWLing.com . <h> First Impressions <p> The face plate on the Alinco DX-R8T is detachable ( with optional extension cable ) . This view , from underneath , shows where it plugs into the receiver body . <p> I really appreciate the size and feel of the Alinco DX-R8T. - Its heavy , with a metal case and a very durable plastic face plate . - It has a bail under the front panel which allows it to be lifted and carried for easy tabletop operation . <p> Please note : If you 're new to tabletop shortwave receivers or ham radio transceivers , be aware that the Alinco DX-R8T is based on the Alinco DX-SR8T ham radio transceiverand as such , it operates on 12VDC. - Meaning , you will need a 12 volt power supply like the Pyramid PS-3 or similar. - If you already have a power supply , make sure it can at least deliver 1.5 amps at 13.8V . You do not want to purchase a " wall wart " type power supply , as many of these are noisy and will effect your ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have actually been running the DX-R8T off of a 40AH , 12 V battery to eliminate all such noise . <p> The tuning knob on the DX-R8T is solid , smooth and certainly pleased this reviewer . <p> The tuning knob , which I personally find to be a particularly important feature , is substantial , solid , and moves- fluidlya plus . - I have not found a way to adjust the tension/resistance on the tuning knob , but havent felt the need to do so , either . The radio is heavy enough that it stays put while tuning and pressing keys , which is also important . <p> The ergonomics are good . I like how the volume , squelch , IF shift and RIT are all easily- accessible single-function knobs . <p> If I have any criticism of this radios ergonomics , it would simply be that several of the buttons are a bit close to the tuning knob . - I have larger fingers , so while pushing the Function switch , RIT switch , keylock or turning the RIT knob , I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a fairly persnickity observation ; in general I 'm pleased with the panel layout and ergonomics . <p> Like the IC-R75 , the DX-R8T has a front-facing speakeralways a good thing when listening via a built-in speaker . Admittedly , the overall fidelity of the built-in speaker is mediocre at bestit lacks any bass response and sounds shallow , and unfortunately , there 's no way to change the tone from high to low . While the built-in speaker is fine for listening to the ham radio bands ( in SSB or a CW mode ) , I would like better fidelity for the broadcast bands . This is no doubt a vestige of this radios ham transceiver heritage . <p> The front display is large , with an adjustable dimmer . It is crisp and- very easy to read , which I like very well . <h> The competition <p> The only current shortwave tabletop competitors with the Alinco DX-R8T ( $500 ) , are the Icom- IC-R75- ( $600-700 ) and the- Palstar R30A- ( $740 US ) . The Icom IC-R75 is a fine receiver and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multi-function tabletop . It has been on the market for years in many versions ( some more- successful- than others ) , and is generally a solid performer . - The Palstar R30A is also an excellent receiver , though it lacks the bells and whistles of its Japanese counterparts . People who buy a Palstar want bare-bones simplicity and performance . <p> Since I own a Palstar R30C ( the predecessor to the R30A ) , I used it as a point of comparison in my review of the DX-R8T . <h> Operation <p> The DX-R8T is a pleasure to operate . I was able to intuit nearly all but the memory functions without looking at the owners manual even once . A major plus , in my opinion ! <p> Tuning is the function you use the most on any radio ; with the DX-R8T you have three ways to tune : <p> the tuning knob <p> the up/down arrows and M/kHz button to toggle steps <p> the direct keypad entry <p> The keypad is configured like that on a phone , which I like . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keypad buttons were slightly bigger . Frequencies are entered in MHz , so to go to 6,925 kHz , for example , you enter " 6 " " . " " 9 " " 2 " " 5 " " ENT . " To move to 6,000 kHz , you can shortcut by entering " 6 " " . " " ENT. " - Simple enough . <p> I did find it helpful to use the up/down arrows to move between meter bands , otherwise I never tune with the up/down arrows . <p> The tuning knob gets my seal of approval and scanning with it is a pleasure . Admittedly , I wish it were a little more adaptive to tuning speed ( i.e. , turning quickly speeds up the frequency steps ) or that it could be adjusted somewhat . You can tell that the Alinco DX-R8T derives from amateur radio , as its tuning knob speed is perfect for finding ham radio stations . <p> The volume , squelch , IF shift and RIT knobs are all well-spaced and easily accessible . <h> Broadcast listening <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tests , it was as sensitive as my Palstar . <p> The generous , wide 9kHz AM bandwidth means that broadcast stations come in with a great deal of fidelity . The flip side of the 9kHz bandwidth , though , is that it is less effective if there is an adjacent stationsay , 5kHz away . Luckily , the DX-R8T has an IF shift knob handy so that a modest adjustment can usually eliminate adjacent interference . <p> I found the narrow AM bandwidth a little too narrow for broadcast listening . - Its a mere 2 kHz wide and is simply too restrictive if listening to music . For voice intelligibility , the narrow filter works fairly well , using the IF shift to open it a bit . This narrow filter could be useful if trying to snag a weak DX signal , as its sufficiently narrow to cut out a lot of noise . <p> Speaking of noise , the Alinco has a respectfully low noise floor . <p> Amateur radio bands <p> The DX-R8T has modes for upper sideband , lower sideband and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It performs rather well on the ham bands , pulling out weak SSB stations from the static . <p> In fact , its 500 Hz CW audio filter is quite good if you like listening to CW under normal conditions . I did try out the DX-R8T on Field Day 2011 and found that it had a hard time dealing with the intensely crowded band conditions . - Adjacent signals cause " thumping " while listening in pile-ups . This was no surprise ; even pricey ham radio transceivers are subject to this type of problem under crowded CW conditions . I usually turn to my Elecraft K2 or Ten-Tec OMNI VI+ ( ham band-only transceivers ) when participating in a Field Day or contest event . <p> Th DX-R8T should do a formidable job listening to SSB ham radio , utility and pirate radio stations and the digital modes ( like PSK31 , RTTY , etc . ) . <p> Versatile : use the DX-R8T as a tabletop , detach the remote head to save footprint in your shack , mount in your car or connect to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker ( see con ) <p> DRM ready <p> Full control of all receiver functions when used as an SDR <p> Excellent value <p> Cons : <p> AM narrow filter is a little too narrow for most broadcasts <p> Some front-panel buttons are a little too close to the tuning knob <p> Mediocre built-in speaker , but good fidelity through external speaker or headphones <p> External speaker hook-up only on front panel <p> Does not come with a 12 volt power supply ( sold separately ) <p> In the spirit of full disclosure , I have to admit that I was very skeptical of the Alinco DX-R8T before reviewing it . The price point was almost too attractive for a tabletop radio , and to offer the versatility of a detachable faceplate and control as an SDR receiver seemed too good to be true . I thought there must be a compromise somewhere. - Fortunately , it seems I was wrong . <p> Rear panel view of the Alinco DX-R8T <p> The Alinco DX-R8T is , in fact , a fine receiver . I especially love the fact that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabletops introduced to the market , there are a number of Software Defined Radios availabletheir performance is excellent , but the learning curve ( especially for a newcomer to the hobby ) can be intimidating . Plus they require a computer . <p> With the Alinco DX-R8T , you get the best of both worlds , a simple " turn on and tune in " tabletop , plus a fully DRM ready SDR . <p> When people write in and ask for advice on buying their first tabletop receiver , I can recommend this DX-R8T without hesitation . Though it lacks the DSP that can be purchased separately with an Icom R75 , its as sensitive as my Palstar R30C and the 9kHz AM bandwidth lends some excellent fidelity into headphones or an external speaker . <p> I must admit , I 'm impressed with the Alinco DX-R8T. - It has all of the major features I like in a tabletop radio : its well-built , easy to use , sensitive , - versatile , and it has sufficient control options to help adjust adjacent interference and improve intelligibility . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its next-best competitor is probably the Icom R75but neither the Icom , nor the Palstar R30A , can be used as an SDR and neither have the appropriate IF output for DRM as does the Alinco DX-R8T. - In short , its a lot of radio for the money , excellent for those starting in the hobby . <p> Paired with a good antenna , the Alinco DX-R8T is a bargain performer . If you 've thought about moving from portable radios to the world of a more serious receiver , you cant go wrong with the Alinco DX-R8T . <p> My tuning knob is pretty firm , but it was a very early model of the radio . I think the knob ( and I rarely say this ) is a little too large ( especially compared with the size of the keypad ) . Thanks for your feedback . <p> Thank you , I would be interested in other peoples feed back , I often think of getting the radio again but rearly put off by that wobbly axis I had on the tuning knob , I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of play up and down , Maybe its not the case ? I have an ICOM 7400 and excaliber SDR I now use for SW , but looking for a simple switch it on and listen set for the shack Maybe the Eton Satilite 750 ? <p> The software provided for the alinco is very " crude " and no where near up to the levels of most other free SDR packages such as HDSDR , SDRadio etc . Also I could not find anyother package that could control the Alinco , so using any other packages was difficult . So you are not missing much I feel that if you want an SDR radio get an SDR = Would still get one for a table top reciever ( If I can get one with a firm Knob ! . oh err ) <p> I fully agree with this test report ! But if you don-t want to do DRM-receiving I strongly recommend to change the wide AM-Filter with a Murata CFK 455I ( 4KHz ) or CFK 455H ( 6KHz ) or equivalent . The Alinco DX-R8 has enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters ! With the 6KHz Collins my Alinco does a great job ! <p> Still toying with the Alinico vs Icom R75 , both seem very good . I want it for MW . SW listening , and HF Aero . Is the AM filter as bad as I hear on all the reviews . or are icom fans nit picking ? an otherwise ok modern R75 replacement ? The r75 is not available new here in the UK any longer , but the R8500 is ? <p> Also can other software such as HDSDR control the radio , as from what I can tell if the IQ output is chosen then the controls and speaker are disabled , if not can you tune the rx normally are use HDSDR at the same time ? KGSDR looks pretty basic , and does nothing to sell the SDR aspect of the rx <p> Hi , I 'd like to know whether the Alinco DR-8 has lower noise floor on AM mode than the ICOM IC-R75 . I have the latter , and I 'm disappointed with it in this regard . I compard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Panasonic DR49/RF-4900lbs and they all performed better than R75 . <p> I like to scan with RF attenuator . I check QRN , bring it down to S1 and then look out for any pop out on the S-meter or that thump when RF amp works when using headphones . With the R75 , it does not work that way . <p> My R75 is the my best radio for SSB and other modes , but disappointed me on AM mode . And most of my DXing is on AM mode HF . <p> Over the past few years I have had several Icom R75s ( two with KIWA mods ) and several Alinco DX-R8 receivers and I now only have the DX-R8 . I found the sensitivity to be about the same on both , but the DX-R8 definitely was a quieter receiver with a slight edge on the signal-to-noise ratio over the R75 . The R75 all sounded " hissy " to me . The stock AM filters in both receiver were " barn door " wide , but the dual IF shift in the R75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I removed the Murata " G " type AM wide filter and replaced it with a drop fit " I " version which can found at Mouser Electronics for about $4.00 . For some reason Mouser calls it a " J " filter which is an incorrect label per the catalog . The equivalent " H " filter will also work but with less effective adjustment range on the IF shift control . I do admit that the " H " has a little better audio fidelity than the " I " filter but I do n't  find the latters audio objectionable . If you want selectivity , use the " I " type filter . CAUTION : make sure you have experience with surface mount soldering before you make the change , OR , have someone that has experience with SMD boards do it for you . Its very easy to damage some of the tiny SMD components on the back side of the board near the filter if you are not careful . <p> The IF shift does work in AM mode , however , the Murata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I replaced mine with a 455I type which is available from Mouser but listed as a 455J in their on line catalog for some reason . The IF shift works great with this filter and the overall audio degradation is not that much due to the narrower bandwidth ( about 5 kHz ) . Just be damn careful if you try to replace it , because the surrounding surface mount parts are very tiny and fragile . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207063 @3907063/ <h> Radio South Atlantic : recording of a short-lived clandestine radio station <p> Radio South Atlantic was a short-lived clandestine radio station started by the UK Ministry of Defence with programmes aimed at Argentine troops on the Falkland islands . This programme was broadcast from a transmitter on Ascension Island which was temporarily taken away from BBC World Service . <p> The Falklands War ( Spanish : Guerra de las Malvinas ) , also known as the Falklands Conflict , Falklands Crisis and the Guerra del Atl+ntico Sur ( Spanish for " South Atlantic War " ) , was a ten-week war between Argentina and the United Kingdom over two British overseas territories in the South Atlantic : the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . It began on Friday 2 April 1982 when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands ( and , the following day , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had long claimed over them . <p> On- 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982 , returning the islands to British control . In total , 649 Argentine military personnel , 255 British military personnel and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities . <p> This is a studio copy of Radio South Atlantic . In May 1982 , the British government decided to set up a Spanish language radio station targeting Argentine troops . This was probably in response to an Argentine radio station ( nicknamed Argentine Annie by the UK press ) which appeared on shortwave some weeks earlier using the Beatles theme " Yesterday " as a signature tune . <p> I was editing the Media Network programme at the time . We could hear Radio South Atlantic in Hilversum but the signal was very weak . So I rang the British embassy in the Hague and asked if it would be possible to get a studio copy of the programme to use in a documentary feature we were making . A few days later , a courier riding a large motorbike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to the front-desk to sign for the tape . " But you cant keep this tape . You can only listen to it " was the message from guy in the helmet . " I have to take it back to the Hague in about half an hour " . I said I 'd look for an empty studio , gave the guy a large coffee and wandered casually round the corner . Then I made a mad dash to the fast copy-room used to make tape copies of RNW transcription programmes for other radio stations . It had a machine that could copy tapes at around 8 times faster than normal .

Clips of various Radio Netherlands programs from 1947 to 1997 will be available . <p> Second question : Why will only clips be made available for download ? <p> The answer to this is simple . Over the last year PCJ Radio International has been very active to remove youtube videos of Radio Netherlands material that is now our property . By having this material uploaded onto youtube the value of the archive diminishes . <p> The other reason is 8 months ago we had to bring action against an ebay seller who was selling a CD of Radio Netherlands material that is now the property of PCJ Radio International .

There is the cost of the shipping container , climate control room for the tapes , discs and films , and a full time staffer whose job it is to catalogue the tapes , discs and films . The most expensive cost is the digitizing of the films . Some of these films are 40 years old and need to be sent to a special lab for colour correction and to make any repairs necessary before they can be copied . Just to give you an example , the cost for one 25 minute film can be between 300 to 500 Euros , depending on the condition . <p> PCJ Radio International 's series From The Radio Netherlands Archives over the next few months will present some of the best programs from the collection . <p> For more information please contact PCJ Radio International at anytime : pcj@pcjmedia.com. 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207068 @3907068/ <h> Tag Archives : Voice of Hope <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , Richard Langley , who shares the following message he recently received from- Ray Robinson , VP of Global Operations with The Voice of Hope . This message is being relayed with Robinsons permission : <p> I have seen a few messages lately , regarding the non-appearance of ZNBC-1 on 5915 kHz in their early mornings . You may be aware of the rolling power outages called load shedding the electricity utility in Zambia , ZESCO , continues to impose daily throughout the country . The outages are at different times in different areas , but at the Voice of Hope transmitter site , the outages have been effect from 6-10am local ( 0400-0800 UTC ) since September . The ZNBC shortwave site is only a few miles from ours , and it would be logical they are on the same outage schedule . I know from when our staff visited their site a few months ago to buy some distilled water for our transmitter cooling systems before our own still was up and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  believe they have the budget either to repair it , or to buy diesel for it , if it was repaired and functional . <p> My guess is they have decided it is not really worth the effort to broadcast for the hour or so from 0245 UTC until whenever the power goes out . ( This is just my speculation . ) They do use 5915 later in the day after the much cheaper hydro power returns , but of course by then , the propagation conditions do not favor inter-continental reception . <p> As for Voice of Hope Africa , we had expected the load shedding to end by December ( two months into the Zambian rainy season ) , but alas the outages are continuing , with no sign of any change soon . Our own weekday morning broadcasts on 9680 and 11680 kHz have been entirely powered from our genset since September . This is expensive , and unsustainable . We have therefore decided to make a schedule change from next Monday . Instead of broadcasting weekday mornings from 0500-0800 UTC , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duration of the broadcast from three hours to five . The last two hours will be Night Light presented by Stephen Mdoma , reprising a program he used to present late nights years ago when the station was known as Christian Voice We will be using the frequencies 4965 kHz ( omni ) and 6065 kHz ( to West Africa ) , which may also afford better opportunities for reception in ECNA after local dusk . The program schedule on our website will be updated this weekend . We plan to re-launch the morning broadcasts once the load shedding ends . I thought you might like to know . <p> We would very much appreciate your reception reports ( or preferably , recordings ) of the tests we will be running on 9975 kHz on Friday and Saturday evenings this week . The exact times are : <p> Saturday 7th 0100-0400 UTC <p> Sunday 8th - 0100-0400 UTC <p> In North and Central America , that would be this Friday and Saturday evenings , 8-11pm Central , 9pm-12am Eastern . The test program will be similar to last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments in both English and Spanish . <p> The transmitter site is near Los Angeles , and here it is currently getting dark at about 0230 UTC ( 7:30pm local ) . Therefore , during the first half of these tests , the transmission path will be increasingly in darkness , and for the last 90 minutes or so will be in complete darkness . Please let us know what reception sounds like at your location as the evening progresses , and also what type of receiver and antenna you are using . <p> Though I 've been extremely busy this past week ( hence the lack of posts ! ) , I did manage to record the KVOH broadcast . Indeed , the following recording includes several minutes of pre-test transmissions ( you 'll hear " Danger Zone " by Kenny Loggins and a tuning carrier ) .

@@75207090 @3907090/ <h> Sangean WR-22 : Bills tale of radios and outdoor antennas <p> I was interested in the Sangean HDR-18 which showed up on SWLing Post . But I- ended up going for the similar-looking WR-22 ( here on the Sangean site ) - because it lookscooler . Well , yes , it also costs a bit less . Also , it trades the HDR-18s HDRadio capability for Bluetooth streaming . Since I have a phone that canstream , and since there is as yet only one HD radio station , which streams , and which I can also get in my car , I thought the Bluetooth might be a bit- more use to me . <p> I got the WR-22 expressly to use outdoor antennas . I had been using a CCRadio 2E for that purpose . The CCRadio actually worked better hauling it- out of the house , out to the picnic table in the back yard , clear of the- aluminum siding and the household electronic buzz . Its nice to be able to- use the portable as a portable . <p> I 'd hoped the WR-22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and FM as- well as the CCRadio . It surprised me by working far better . Therein hangs a- sad tale of radios and outdoor antennas . <p> I have a rooftop FM antenna I 'd used on an old stereo . The CCRadio doesnt- have an external FM radio jack , so I could never use the FM antenna with the- CCRadio . <p> The CCRadio does have screw terminals for an AM outdoor antenna . A few- months ago , I put out a temporary one in the back yard . Its quite modest , - within the ability of anyone with a small back yard . A ground rod pounded- into the ground outside the drip line of the roof , where the soil will get- wet ; wet soil makes for a better ground , Im told . Then a bit less than 50- feet of insulated copper wire , looped across the back yard to a pine tree- branch and then to a post we used to have a satellite TV dish on . Nothing- too complicated here . <p> The results were disappointing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the CCRadio would do on its own on the picnic table . Oh- well , maybe nothing better was possible ? <p> Then , after I 'd ordered the WR-22 through the mail , I came across a- description of a different external AM antenna . I found it on two web sites , - but C Cranes own web site has a description of the thing . Heres thearticle . <p> It could use the wire I 'd already strung across the back yard and the ground- rod I 'd already planted , so why not try it ? I could n't see how an antenna- that did n't  connect to the radio directly could be any better than one that- did , but hey , it did n't  cost anything to try . <p> here 's how to make the antenna : String an outdoor wire somewhere SAFE , well- away from anything carrying electric current , both because it can get you- fried and because of radio noise . Reserve some of the wire to wind a coil at- the end of the wire inside the house , near your radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio will be . C Crane says a 3 inch coil with 7 turns , - another site said a few turns of 6 inches diameter ; apparently its not too- critical . <p> The wire continues unbroken through the coil , back out of the house again , - and to your ground rod outside . It does n't  connect directly to your radio at- all . Of course you could do the wire in several pieces ; have a separate coil- which attaches to the aerial wire and the ground wire with alligator clips , - for example . This would let you replace the different parts , experiment with- different sizes , shapes , and orientations of coils , and so on . <p> As with any inductively coupled antenna , you get this loop to work by moving- the coil around the outside of the radio until you find the " sweet spot " - where it couples best with the portable radios internal ferrite bar . <p> Good heavens ! It worked far better than coupling the wire directly to the- CCRadio . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the- space for it , if I 'm careful- and a neater installation , with a neatly wound- coil . I planned a program of trying different coils to see what would work- best. - However , I had the WR-22 on order . Since that was where I wanted to attach- outdoor antennas , I decided to wait until it came in before experimenting- with any new antennas . <p> It came in and I set it up . <p> To my disappointment , the coil-type outdoor- antenna did n't  seem to send the WR-22 any signal at all . Before getting all- antisocial about it , I hooked the external antenna to the WR-22s AM antenna- screw terminals . <p> My goodness , all over again ! Where the CCRadio had n't  responded to this- setup at all well , the WR-22 lit up with all sorts of signals . Now , I 'd read- on your site that the HDR-18 coupled the external AM antenna via a coil- wrapped around its internal ferrite rod . Perhaps this radio already HAS the- magic coil that seems to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It goes to show that your mileage may vary ; a little experimentation with- your particular setup never hurts ! <p> I have a problem I 'm sure a lot of your readers would love to have ; there- are exactly NO really powerful AM radio signals in my area . Today I set up- several radios for a rough comparison to give you an idea of how things work- here . <p> Tecsun PL-880 , no external antenna , sitting on the " best " windowsill in the- back of the house : 4 AM ( Medium wave ) stations . <p> This was during the day . At night pretty much anything lights up on most of- the AM frequencies ; I expect the WR-22 will do well here , although I havent- tried it yet . <p> As for FM , with the rooftop antenna , the WR-22 did well enough . I got- anything I could reasonably expect to get with it . I had unreasonably hoped- to get a certain second public radio network I like to switch over to when- the main public radio network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.5 months a year , it seems ) . Did n't  get a peep of it . I had- only been able to get it with the CCRadio , twisting the antenna to a 45- degree angle to the vertical in a certain direction . <p> The rooftop antenna is- horizontal . I read somewhere that FM signals are polarized at 45 degrees to- the vertical so that they would work on both horizontal TV antennas and- vertical car antennas , therefore for maximum discrimination a FM antenna- that could also be tilted to 45 degrees would be helpful . I do n't  know if- that 's true or not . As textbook writers say when they are lazy and dont- want to do their job , building a rotating rooftop FM antenna with variable- remote-adjustable tilt is left as an exercise to the reader . <p> If you 'd like to see what Ive received with this radio so far , click here for my station log map . <p> Yellow is AM daytime signals , green is FM , red is AM nighttime signals ; only- about three of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you so some- of the identifications may be a bit shaky , but it gives an idea of the- performance I 'm getting . <h> WR-22 performance <p> What about the radio itself ? <p> I have no way of measuring performance with test instruments , but with the- external antennas at least sensitivity and selectivity seem to be perfectly- good . <p> The radio comes packed in good quality materials , very well protected . It is- heavy and seems very solid . I like that the remote control actually allows- tuning the radio from across the room , not just switching from one memory to- another . I think this is the first radio with remote I have had which- allowed this . <p> Sound is very good . As another reviewer said of the HDR-18 , the WR-22 has a- loudness function to boost bass ( and probably treble too ) . It was n't hard- to find the setting to turn that off , and I prefer sound without it . <p> I found no electronic birdies anywhere in either band . Bluetooth pairing was- easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming- Bluetooth is also very good . <p> The only thing I do n't  like about the radio so far is that in switching- source you have to go through all of them : from AM , push the button to go to- USB to Aux 3.5 mm plug input to Bluetooth to FM and back to AM again . Thats- a pretty minor irk . <p> I 'd expected this radio to have an external power supply . The manual , in- fact , says to put the power supply away from the radio in order to prevent- AM interference . But my WR-22 does n't  have an external power supply , just a- power cord . Mine is the USA version ; the manual describes two different- versions . Perhaps the other has an external power supply . <p> I 'm not complaining . I prefer a radio without a wall wart . <p> I 'm happy with this set . I have no idea how it would work without external- antennas , but it works beautifully with them . <p> Thanks , Bill , for sharing your antenna experiments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often finding the performance " sweet spot " of any given radio requires a little experimentation ! The AM performance of the WR-22 is very encouraging ! <p> Very nice job of experimenting ! Sometimes you have to try things out yourself . If you read radiojayallen web site and look through his AM receiver Shootout , some radios work with inductive antenna coupling and a few just do not . Other quirks show up too like sensitivity or selectivity tests . I have the new HDR18 and it works well except that the ferrite bar antenna for AM does not disengage when connecting an external antenna . Even with my noisy location , it still picks up some HD radio Stations on AM . The only thing I do n't  like is the somewhat robot-like computer sound of its audio output , not horrible , compared to a regular AM/FM solid state tuner , sounds somewhat more harsh by comparison . It works well , so I am keeping it . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

I quickly packed up and- attempted to catch back up with my schedule . <p> I was grateful the Elk were elsewhere Thursday ! <p> Back at the rangers station , I learned that the Ocunaluftee Visitor Center is also another National Park entity : - the Trail Of Tears ( TR12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more , but made a mental note to add it to activations on my return trip . <h> NP26 and TR01 <p> Next , I hopped in my car and drove to the Newfound Gap parking area where the Appalachian Trail ( TR01 ) crosses the Great Smoky Mountains Park ( NP26 ) . <p> The view there was/is amazing : <p> The area was packed with tourists , so I decided to hike up the Appalachian Trail ( AT ) to escape the bulk of the crowd . <p> I hiked at least one mile up the narrow and steep AT before finding a suitable spot to set up my gear .

Located in Sackville , New Brunswick , it was perfectly positioned to transmit across the Atlantic Ocean , and covered most of the globe with its transmissions . <p> This experimental documentary film focuses on the flat marshland landscape accompanied by stories told by local residents and the technicians who worked at the site . <p> After beginning this project , the Canadian government announced that the Radio Canada International shortwave relay site would be shut down and dismantled .

The beginning of the demolition is a rich soundscape with the drones of all thirteen towers playing together .

Lower bit rate digital audio does reveal its insufficiencies with increased volume , but that would be true regardless of the speaker ratings . <p> A 30 watt RMS driver/tweeter speaker combo in a box this compact bespeaks a pretty efficient and powerful digital amplifier that would shine if fed audio of sufficient " heft " .

Frankly , I think Jameco are a bunch of liars , putting fictitious descriptions that do not reflect the traditional interpretation of the definition of technical words as we expect from a technical manual .

@@75207177 @3907177/ <h> Creating a global network of inexpensive remote SDRs <p> With Shortwave SDRs ( the receiver dongle ) now costing less than $20 , the time has come for us to set up a global group of receivers that we can all log into at will ! <p> Have a look at SDR.hu here you can put your SDR dongle on line and share it with anyone and they have full control of the receiver just as if it was in their own shack . <p> Imagine receivers scatted around the world South America , Tropical Asia , Africa ! The cost is now virtually nothing , all that is needed is the dongle , antenna ( does n't  have to be anything special even a long wire or whip ) and a small low cost CPU ( Raspberry Pi for example ) . <p> Anyone else interested in this dream ? Let 's get together , get some receivers setup and then talk about our experience in a kick-ass presentation at the 2017 SWL WinterFest in PA ! <p> Also I am very soon to receive my KiwiSDR matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDR.hu and four remote listeners will be able to tune the full shortwave bands independently , its like my own Twente setup ! Heaps of others are getting receivers online in the next few months with KiwiSDRs , this is going to be totally amazing ! <p> I agree , Mark ! While there is already quite a network of remote SDRs and receivers in the world , the barrier of entry keeps getting lower and lower . Its hard to imagine that $25 can buy an SDR that natively covers- the shortwave and mediumwave bands ! <p> There 's only one other requirement for an online SDR that Mark did n't  mention : a decent Internet connection . Sadly , this is the only thing keeping me from hosting a remote SDR here at my home . I considered purchasing a KiwiSDR like Mark , but my upload- speed ( 0.2-0.3 mbps ) is so terrible and so unreliable that I could only host one listener at a time- at best . You can bet that as soon as my ISP upgrades our service , I 'll launch a web SDR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that most SWLing Post readers have more than enough bandwidth to host a $25 remote receiver ! Let 's make Marks vision a reality ! <h> 8 thoughts on " Creating a global network of inexpensive remote SDRs " <p> I think the network is a fact . 1 . SDR.hu 2. websdr.org 3. remotehams.com ( shortwave listeners are welcome ) <p> I am a little skeptical about the abilities of the current $20 receivers they need a little more work to make them a mainstream HF receiver . But I often browse the sites above and I also maintain a station on remotehams.com under my call NO2CW . SW listeners are always welcome and many times they connect to listen to local South Florida AM stations or to catch the Bahamas on 810 and 1540khz . <p> I am a little skeptical too . The poor HF coverage from 500 kHz to 24 MHz does not make this ( new ) dongle a good candidate for a global network . Minimum requirement for HF coverage is in my opinion from 150 kHz to 30 MHz . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that price is becoming less and less a barrier of entry . The new RTL-SDRs might not be the best for HF performance , but perhaps they 're good enough for newcomers to begin experimenting ? <p> I think its very cool , Ivan , that you have remotehams.com receiver online . Againas soon as I have the bandwidth , I 'll join you ! = <p> One frustration I have with these cheap dongles being put online , is that they cover only a small portion of the spectrum , and nearly always they are set to tune some ham band and rarely a broadcast band . <p> Also , the 8-bit resolution does n't  make for good S/N ratio , even when the antenna is properly installed away from man made noise . <p> KiwiSDR looks promising , but from what I can tell , it looks like its $300 for the kit and you have to assemble it yourself , including soldering the tiny SMT parts . <p> here 's a rough price/parts list on what I think is probably the realistic minimum to do this . Older parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on new implementations off the shelf from US suppliers . If you know of a cheaper off the shelf antenna solution that 's not a 6-hour long DIY project I 'd love to hear it . <p> * Sufficient upstream to support your desired number of listeners Youll likely hit a practical usage wall on the ( signal ) bandwidth limit of the RTL-SDR as well for multiple listeners wanting to visualize more than a 2 MHz chunk of bandwidth at any given time . All told this requires around $110 in hardware , and some patience and many hours set aside to follow various tutorials . Your level of Linux familiarity and comfort on the command-line will determine your ease of setup . <p> The idea I had in my head was a growing hive of low cost SDRs scatted around the world . <p> Its kind on an conceptual leap or extension of something I already have set up as an idea . Because of my keen interest in North Korea I have my own satellite dish and receiver now installed in Taiwan which receives domestic Nth Korean Television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in Australia . I can tune the receivers , and operate the dish system remotely as if it was in my backyard in Sydney . The digital video and audio is delivered to me with no quality loss , so it feels kind of like I have a very , very , very long coax feed from Australia to the dish in Taiwan , of course the link is actually IP . <p> So now not thinking about satellite microwave signals , but thinking about tropical band broadcasting . I would love to have receivers located in the equatorial regions to listen to the many shortwave domestic and regional services at good listening quality , I 'm not actually thinking of typical DXer type interests . ( What I mean by this is that often a DXer is usually quite happy to receive a weak signal make out a 30 second I 'd and be happy with chasing down the capture ) . My interest is more in being able to listen to the station and its exotic programming , so more towards the SWL interest rather than DXing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and operate SDRs would be ideal for listeners to listen a very exotic distant station at local quality than they have little chance of hearing from their own location . Thinking this way the less than communications receiver quality of the stick SDRs does n't  really matter . A few of them scatted around Indonesia , India or Africa would to my interests be amazing . <p> Just like people have done in recent years for ADS B signals , hundreds of low cost stick receivers can be scatted around the globe , often even provided free-of-change ( with a small pool of donation funding ) to interested SWLs in remote , exotic , and interesting locations . The ADS B free SDR dongle receiver distributions by outfits such as PlaneFinder , Flightradar 24 , RadarBox have all found quite often acceptable broadband is found often in the most unlikely places and now allow for real time aircraft tracking in most parts of the planet . So same idea as what the ADS B fans have done but this time for SWL interests . <p> As for frequency range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 75MB etc. so my mind had n't  actually thought of providing wide band 0 to 30 MHz etc . There are SDR sticks that can tune from 500 kHz to 1.7 GHz and has up to 3.2 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth , so that was what I was basing my thinking on . <p> I 'm going to put together a few ( maybe 3 ) and give then to friends in India and hopefully Indonesia to install in their offices piggybacking on their business network . If we can find other cool places to drop them into in other parts of the world it would also be very cool !

@@75207186 @3907186/ <h> A review of the new Avion receiver and a few thoughts about DRM <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post reader , Mike Barraclough , for sharing a link to this review of the new Avion DRM receiver- by DRM Radio Forum user PhilipOneL. - I 've pasted his evaluation of the Avion- belowyou can read this , along with the full discussion thread , on the DRM Radio Forum : <p> I received my Avion AV-DR-1401 this afternoon and have had it up and running for a couple of hours . There is no instruction booklet with it so I am puzzling over the 41-button remote . It is not as user-friendly as I hoped . <p> First impression : somewhat cheap feel to it . I have put a small bend already in the thin but long aerial . But that is just the outside ( handle , volume control , master power switch , and aerial ) ; I hope it works well anyway . But that cheapness hurts when the price of the radio was fairly high to begin with and I paid more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The radio arrived with its battery fully charged : nice . ( But I need to get an adaptor for the AC adaptors mains plug which has tubular prongs rather than the North American blade prongs . ) I like a lot the fact that it runs normally with its internal battery rather than plugged into mains . This means I can carry it away from noise sources . And it is very carryable it reminds me of a small 1965-era beach radio in size . <p> Turned on , it scanned the local FM spectrum well and registered all the local stations . But I can not get the Scan function to operate on MW and SW , nor in DRM mode . With an outside antenna ( 8 metre wire ) attached , it was able to get the AIR DRM broadcast on 7550 kHz and decode it . It did n't  seem to be able to get enough signal with just the extending aerial . <p> I have not figured out yet how to make it register a medium-wave , shortwave , or DRM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button labelled " Delete / Store " is pushed . Among the 41 buttons , there is no other likely candidate for that function . <p> Shortwave sensitivity in AM mode seems to be poor . I was listening , for instance , to ERT Greece on 9420 on the three receivers now on my desk : Satellit 750 , MorphyRichards 27024 , and the Avion DR-1401 , each in turn connected to the same outdoor antenna . The MR27024 produces the best sound and greatest s/n ratio . It seems far more sensitive than the Avion . But who knows ? I may discover I am doing something wrong with the set . <p> Tuning can be done by inputting a frequency on the remote . Alternatively , the volume wheel can be pushed ( this takes two hands ) to convert it to a tuning knob . Two problems are apparent . One is that the signal is muted as you tune until you wait on a frequency for four or five seconds . Thus it is a slow and aggravating experience to try to tune across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a station is tuned and producing audio , the knob goes back to being a volume control . Grrrr . ( I think there is a professor at all the design schools who seems to be telling all her/his students to be visually minimalist in design and to give every knob multiple functions . That professor should be publicly shamed until she/he recants and causes all the students to go back to multiple knobs each of which does one thing well . ) When the radio gets itself ready to produce audio it seems to ramp itself up to full audio in a series of four steps , each a half-second or so after the last it is an odd-sounding process . It is like a faulty AGC circuit ; perhaps it is . <p> Sound quality is mediocre at best on AM ( both mw and sw ) . I did n't  listen long enough to the DRM signal from AIR before it signed off to get a good idea of DRM audio quality ; I was busy cooking supper . FM audio is mediocre too on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to external speakers , it is quite good . When I piped the AM audio out it still seemed mediocre . <p> Why the AM sound is mediocre seems to be related to two things : the tiny speakers ( about 8 cm or 3.3 inches ) and the bandwidth at the radio stage . Even comparatively strong ( and clean ) signals like RHC on 6000 kHz have what may be adjacent signals mixing in perhaps even internal mixing products ? I heard a splash of a local FM station at one point while listening to a shortwave band . <p> I have written my contact at Avion ( Ankit ) asking for an instruction booklet , or a pdf of one . I hope I 'll get that early next week ( if indeed they have one ) . <p> I hope over the next week I will get some chances to check out more DRM signals . I am also hoping that my gradual love affair with the MorphyRichards radio will be replicated here . When I first got the MR27024 I was very cranky about its weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good antenna on it , and got used to its ways , I prefer it to all my other radios as a table-top radio ( that is , one useful for listening to specific regular stations ) . The MRs radio-stage DSP is quite lovely and makes for good sound . I doubt the Avion will seduce me to quite the same extent , but it may grow on me in other ways . <p> I understand the problems with DRM but I am still a fan of of the system . I bought this Avion set partly in hopes that I would encourage the manufacturer in some small way . I will use it but I suspect that the minimalist design features ( which were also a part of the MorphyRichards design ) will turn off users of the Avion . <p> I 'm not terribly surprised by this reviewers assessment . Just looking at some of the preliminary info on the Avion receiver last year made me think of previous DRM portables like the Newstar DR111 and the Uniwave Di-Wave 100 . <p> The UniWave Di-Wave/Di-Wave 100 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by engineers and entrepreneurs who had not gotten customer input in advance . <p> Its sad , too . While I know DRM ( via the shortwaves ) was a " cart before the horse " innovationmeaning , broadcasters adopted the technology well before consumer receivers were on the market . <p> I really wish the medium wouldve gained traction . <p> While I prefer the rich sonic texture of amplitude modulation , I- love listening to DRM broadcasts well . Last year , during my presentation at PARI , I played a recording of a piano concerto I heard on one of Radio New Zealand Internationals DRM broadcasts . If memory serves , the audio clip was taken from this recording I made on June 21 , 2104 : <p> " Were listening to a radio station some 8,300 miles away without the use of the Internet , mobile phones , satellites , or any sort of subscription service . Were hearing FM-quality audio , streamed- wirelessly and originating from the other side of our planet . " <p> I then received a number of questions like : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do they make car radios that can receive these broadcasts ? " <p> Theres magic in DRM . Sadly , I feel its deployment was awkward and its window of opportunity may have already passed . An affordable , effective , and simple DRM receiver ( combined with serious , viral- publicity ) could turn the tide somewhatbut it does n't  seem like this will happen anytime soon . Each new DRM portable is- only a slightly improved iteration of its predecessor and the- price tag continues to be too high for effective market penetration . <p> FORTY ONE button remote ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! Seriously quit trying to make this a portable , and make it more like a tabletop . Also , quit pointing speakers at my eyes . I use my ears to hear with . Speakers take up too much valuable front panel space . You could fire the sound out the bottom . How much longer till this is just a tablet/pad anyway ? You can hang a RTL dongle off the back of a Kindle Fire like I did ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no DRM decode option *at this time* . Its only a matter of time before that changes . That said , there 's something about having a nice big knob to turn for frequency . Screen needs a waterfall option . Look at Elecraft KX3 for design clues . <p> I am beginning to think DRM is shortwaves Betamax format . There are so many different shortwave receivers around that DRM can not obsolete and corner the market like digital television did ( by government edict ) . Not much thought about how SWLs use their radios . I would NEVER buy a radio without a nice tuning knob . I want to find signals I want to listen to not have big brother say what I can ( and can not ) listen to . Also , why a handheld remote for a radio that is by itself portable and can the radio be usable if the remote fails or gets lost ? I can understand a remote for a large flatscreen TV you have to sit 10 feet away to view . Chalk this up to " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @Edward , if only DRM was the Betamax of shortwave . It was always technically superior to VHS in terms of picture but they made a strategic mistake in the beginning by limiting recordings to 1 hour rather than VHS two . <p> I just do n't  understand why no one can do a job in 2015 of implementing a 1990s reception system . Would be nice to see what Eton , Sangean or Tecsun could do with it . But obviously they do not see the financial return . <p> In the meantime , I do sometimes listen to DRM on my Perseus using the Dream software . But this is hardly a portable option ! <p> I think the big block in developing these DRM schemes is MONEY . A radio provider has to figure a way of subscription services to listeners . like cable or phone/internet service . The piece of hardware is useless/worthless/non functional without payment . I was given so many old cell phones . all I save is the ac chargers and sometimes batteries . the rest gets chucked- all monolithic smt construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a UHF radio for swl use . <p> I want DRM to make it , and its a better system than HDRadio . But were stuck in a loop : Radios are terrible and expensive , so no one has any . No one is listening , so no one transmits . No one transmits , so no major radio companies are trying it out . On and on . <p> Meanwhile I 'd love to see the FCC finally crack on their outdated rules and let a few experimental DRM stations run in the US keep them 500watts to 1kW if needed . This should have happened 10 years ago , but better late than never . Give people a chance to experience what DRM can be . <p> I can not comment on the FCC . But I do not understand why noone developed a radio from from available parts with these characteristics : <p> * Size of my trusty Sony ICF7600D so I can put it in a coat pocket or so . <p> * 10 h of battery life . <p> * Reasonable reception . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or WLAN service I can listen to my favorite stations . But only larger tablets have enough battery capacity for my 10 h request . And all this is without the fun of shortwave reception = <p> DRM on mediumwave make no sense with low power . The radius is half compared with AM modulation . 10 50 kW is needed if you want to reach listners . But in facto , SW is the best with 10 50 kW . The radius will be great . A couple of 100 km radius . <p> As with FM , I suspect you will be proven wrong eventually . Newer technologies , especially in light of the nearly ubiquitous spyphone and spynet will take longer to gain traction , but ignorance and generally poor configurations by broadcasters also play a significant role in DRMs slow adoption . We all wish that new receivers performed flawlessly upon release , but they do n't  even from major manufacturers . As long as CSI continues to address initial problems and improve their receiver , the market for their DRM radio will grow . Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production DRM receiver and its price will drop with increasing volume IF CSI continues to improve it . <p> This is only part of the problem , not only at All India Radio : They do DRM but with terrible program feeds . 3 kHz audio bandwidth and lots of distortions as if they use a 2.000 km analog phone line . <p> Recently I exchanged mails with a former DRM representative of Deutsche Welle . He asked several DRM broadcasters about their unsatisfactory audio quality and got no responses . From his active time he knew the respective people personally . <p> I know of only one international broadcaster with an even worse audio quality than AIR : Radio Kairo or how they are called . Havent heard them for quite some time <p> Many companies that joined the consortium at the beginning have pulled out . Sangean did have a DRM project , but they pulled the plug on it . As their head of sales for Asia/Pacific told me " Why produce a radio for a format where there is almost no content " . <p> DRM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But over the last 15 years plus . New methods of delivering content have taken off . <p> Do n't  get me wrong . I love the technology . But radios like the Avion are not going to do anything to help DRM . Even in India they are now making the switch to FM . Yes All India Radio did spend million to upgrade its HF network . But All India Radio is known for being one of the most corrupt broadcasting organizations in the world . <p> In a personal e-mail just received a spokesperson of Avion now announced a new firmware for their AV-DR-1401 soon to be published on their website for free download . They will need at least another week for this . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

We visit the museum every yearand every year I discover something new . <p> This BC-348 can be found in one of the museums B-29 displays . <p> In June , the Air Force museum is actually opening a fourth- building which will house an additional- 70 aircraft in four new galleries . <p> For all of my Monday NPOTA activations , I used the EFT Trail Friendly- antenna I purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made set-up a breeze : simply throw a line into a tree , hang the end of the antenna , then hook up the other end to the feedline/transceiver . No antenna tuner is needed for 40 , 20 or 10 meters once the antenna is tuned for resonance . It packs up into a small bundle that easily fits in my radio go-kit ( see photo above ) . <p> The LD-11/QRP Ranger/EFT antenna combo worked amazingly well and made for very quick deployment . <p> I can easily fit the LD-11 transceiver and QRP Ranger on a foldable metal chair ( my make-shift field table ! ) . <p> Despite not having my antenna very far off the ground ( my antenna line fell down one branch in the process of hanging ) I still managed to work a pile-up of stations from Georgia , North Carolina , Ohio , Illinois , Connecticut , Michigan and Indiana . After Eric and I racked- up a number- of QSOs , we packed up our site in haste- and made our way to the final activation of the day : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We arrived as the Park Ranger was getting in his car to leave for the day ! <p> At Hopewell , I managed to deploy the EFT antenna much higher off the ground . I worked a small pile up of stations from all over the region which , to my surprise , included two radio friends ( Ed and Eileen ) in Franklin , NC . Eric also worked blogging buddy John Harper , AE5X- on 20 meters CW ( got your message , John ! ) . <p> All in all , it was a fantastic day to be outdoors and on the air . <p> Of course , a side benefit of doing National Parks On The Air activations is that you get to check out all of these amazing park sites . <p> Without a doubt , this was one fun-filled and radio-centric Hamvention week ! It couldnt have been better . <p> Part of my log sheet for NPOTA HP11 and TRO4 " Two-Fer " activations . Not bad for such a tight schedule ! <h> Thank you <p> Many thanks to my friends- Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( K8RAT ) and Christine ( KM4PDS ) for volunteering to manage our Hamvention booth for Ears To Our World . It was a record year for collecting donations . Many thanks to all of you for the support ! <p> I 'd also like to thank- the SWLing Post readers who stopped by to visit our new location in the Silver Arenait was great seeing everyone ! <p> Now that I 'm back home , I essentially have one week of emails and comments in my backlog to sort- before hitting the road again rather soon . I appreciate your patience as I catch up .

@@75207195 @3907195/ <h> Anniversary of Sputnik I Launch &amp; Radio Moscow <p> Yesterday , 4 October , was the anniversary of the Soviet Unions launch of Sputnik I , the first artificial Earth satellite . The launch heralded the beginning of the space age . Sputnik Is Doppler-shifted radio transmissions on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz led to the development of the U.S. Navy Navigation Satellite System ( Transit ) and the equivalent Soviet system ( Tsikada ) and , eventually , to GPS and GLONASS and the other modern global navigation satellite systems . <p> The Sputnik I radio signals were picked up by many shortwave listeners . The 20 MHz signal was close to that of WWV and so was easy to find . And , apparently , WWV turned off its 20 MHz transmitter during some of Sputnik Is passes over the U.S. so as not to interfere with reception . <p> There are several good sites on the Web with information about Sputnik I and its radio signals including : 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 4 thoughts on " Anniversary of Sputnik I Launch &amp; Radio Moscow " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection from high school . The back of the card says Radio Moscow in several different languages although it does n't  have a reception date . A regular Radio Moscow QSL card , however , yellow , showing a drawing of a Russian Building with a star on top of it is dated August 8 , 1962 . I am assuming that I received both cards around the same time . In fact , 1967 would have been too late for me to receive the card since I would have been away from home and in the Army by 1967 . In 1962 I was entering sophomore year of High School . Reception was by a Zenith Transoceanic and probably some random wire running out the window and into the back yard . I had that radio and an old Hallicrafters TW1000 that I had bought for $10 with no cabinet . Life was good ! ! ! <p> Although there are no reception details on the back of my card either ( see above ) , it may very well be a QSL card . Checking my old log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see that I sent a reception report to Radio Moscow for a logging on 28 February 1964 at 00:00 GMT ( UTC ) on 7150 kHz . My log book indicates that a QSL was received on 20 March 1964 ( the fourth one I received since starting SWLing after getting my Knight-Kit Span Master for Christmas 1963 ) . I saved all my cards and there is no other Radio Moscow QSL card with those reception details . I do have a postcard of the building used by Radio Moscow but its backside is blank . So , while I was wrong about when this card was first issued , it may still be a QSL card rather than a souvenir card . Anyone else have this card in their collection perhaps with reception details on the back ( there is lots of room for typewritten or handwritten information ) ? 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207196 @3907196/ <p> Producer Myke Dodge Weiskopf- recently released a new- and- expanded edition of At The Tone which- is now available for purchase and download . <p> Myke describes the update : <p> " The new edition significantly expands on the previous CD reissue from 2009 . It incorporates a bunch of tapes sourced from the original announcer tracks made by Jane Barbe herself for WWVH , as well as a handful of vintage broadcast recordings previously left out of the set . I 've also taken the opportunity to clean up and remaster the set overall , so its a much more cohesive listening experience as a body of work . " <p> I am fairly sure that the first time I heard the time standard was on the flightline at Andrews AFB in the winter of 1963-64 . I had just gotten out of avionics school at Keesler AFB and was stationed at Andrews . I was checking out a BC-348 ( ? ) on a C-54 aircraft . <p> The first time I heard WWV and WWVH was in 1965 . I was in high school and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a kit . Had a long wire antenna from my bedroom window to a tree in a vacant lot next door . <p> The year was 1969 and the radio a Hitachi WH837 portable with an external wire antenna . I was a student living in Morecambe UK right by the sea at the time . The station has been part of my life for propagation info and accurate time ever since . <p> I 'd have to say the first time I heard WWV would have been in 1999 or thereabouts . Picked up a very used RAX-1 aircraft receiver from Fair Radio Sales , and was giving it a run-down to see what it did or did n't  do . For a radio that was run into the ground , it worked well , used 35 ft of wire strung up into a nearby pine tree for a makeshift antenna . Pretty crude setup , but it worked fine . Heard WWV on 10Mc and 15Mc as I recall <p> Sometime in 1974 . I borrowed a friends Kmart SW radio . My father and I fired up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted down WWV , my first QSL . Many , many years later I listened to WWVH while on vacation in Hawaii . On nights when the bands were barren of signals I would dial in WWV as background noise . Pretty bizarre to think that a time reference could act as a calming device ! <p> It was Christmas morning , 1982 , and I had received a stack of old-time radio shows on cassette ( I was a nerdy , nerdy 11-year-old ) and a Panasonic R-5310 boom box to play them on . This great radio included 3 shortwave bands , and once I had unwrapped it and plugged it in , I tested them out . WWV was one of the only signals I could pick up with the whip antenna in my room , but it helped to build my love for all things radio which continues to this day . <p> The Year was 1968 , I was 13 years old and it was Christmas day . I had just received a shiny new Hallicafters S-118 from my dad WB4YAL . My dad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my bedroom window . I turned the rig on and gave it a chance to warm up . <p> As I tuned around I heard all the big guns such as VOA , BBC and Radio Moscow . Then as I got to 10 megacycles , I heard BEEPBEEPBEEPI yelled for my dad and have came in laughing and explained that this was WWV and they provided time info and you could align radio equipment with their accurate signal . <p> 1973 when I was 10 years old . I bought a WWII Army BC312D Jeep radio built in Fort Monmouth NJ , 10 mins from where I grew up &amp; used to listen to it on 15MHz or lower , since it only covered to 18MHz . I used it to learn about the BFO &amp; how it worked I finally built antenna to " look " at WWVB the other night on 60KHz , using my Elad S2 , I could actually see the 19 bits of data I 'm still learning from NIST , 42 years later <p> The first time for me was around 1978 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug in my dads Radio Shack or Realistic DX-160 to see what it would do . It was in the basement with just some sort of whip on the backside and it had a separate speaker . It was just sitting there on a table , never used so I went for it . It had to be that I picked up either 10 or 15 mhz because he was a work during the day . I kept spinning the dials and flipping a few switches and bam , there it was , man I thought I just picked up some sort of military station , just too cool . I was hooked on something I had absolutely no idea about . That 's where my shortwave addiction began and here I am still being addicted to it . <p> I remember listening to WWV when it was in or near Greenbelt Md around 1964 . I lived not too far away in a small town , Cheverly , Md . The radio was a small transistor radio that had the AM band and a SW band as well . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I always enjoyed setting my wind up watch to it every day . <p> I tuned in WWV for the first time during the summer of 1962 . I was nine years old and lived a few miles north of Salmon , Idaho . The radio was my Dads WWII surplus Hammarlund RBG CHC 46140 . I used WWV to calibrate the RBG tuning dials so I could listen to weekly catechism lessons from Vatican Radio . Nonetheless , I learned to enjoy listening to shortwave . I still have the RBG . <p> To the best of my recollection , it would have been 1984 . My dad acquired a Panasonic RF-2600 portable receiver and through it I was introduced to the world , as well as WWV . I remember hearing it rather clearly from Tuscaloosa , Alabama on 5 , 10 and 15 Mhz and more rarely on 20 MHz . As a kid I remember being curious about the announcement mentioning 2.5 MHz , as that radio did not tune that low . What was I missing ! ? I always thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female voice preceding the male announcement . It was n't until just a few years ago that I got back into the SWL hobby and learned that it was WWVH being heard behind WWV ! <p> Despite my break from SWL from the mid-90s to just a few years ago , I 've always kept a SW radio around and have used WWV to set clocks , even into the " atomic clock " and smartphone era of today . Its just habit , and its easy . <p> Just last month I fulfilled a goal of mine , getting a QSL card from the NIST . I received it for hearing their " experimental " broadcast on 25 MHz in October . <p> The first time I heard WWV was in 1970 on a battery operated Unelco 1914 Shortwave Radio that my parents purchased from Sears for my 13th birthday ! It came with three sets of plug-in coils ( ANT and OSC ) and it was probably the greatest gift I ever received ( the equivalent of Ralphies Red Ryder BB Gun for me ) ! It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 45 years . And I still tune in WWV from time to time ( heh heh ) but its really more for the memories that it still brings back to me than for setting my watch . <p> That would have been 1986 with a Magnavox D1835 portable , which I still have . It only covered the 10 and 15 MHz signals . I used it for timekeeping for amateur astronomy and for the solar/geomagnetic reports . WWV is still a good frequency calibrator for software-defined radios and I can never resist a quick listen whenever Im on shortwave . <p> The first time I received WWV was in 1956 just after I got my Novice license ( WN2NMG ) . I received WWV on a home brew four tube receiver using a long wire dipole antenna . The first receipt of WWVH was in 1957 on the same receiver . <p> It was 1971 on a Realistic DX-120 " Star Patrol " from Radio Shack that I received for my eleventh birthday in New Jersey . My watch was always accurate after I discovered WWV ! Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was amazed when I discovered the female voice I sometimes heard in the background was all the way from Hawaii . <p> The first time I heard WWV had to have been the evening of December 25 , 1996 . I was ten years old and had just read about SWLing in Muse Magazine , and my interest was piqued . So while visiting my grandparents for Christmas , my granddad ( Jim , K5ROV ) pulled me into his radio room and found a few shortwave stations on his ham radio transceiver ( probably a Yaesu ; I cant recall the model ) , including the time signal stations . <p> I first heard WWV in 1972 on a Radio Shack Astronaut 8 shortwave radio , that I received for Christmas . Shortwave was fascination , and I obtained a Novice ham license the following year . Some of the announcements , such as the solar flux value at 18-minutes-past-the-hour were valuable for propagation indicators back then ( wayyyy before internet ) . <p> 1975 , on a GE World Monitor . It was n't really my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken my multiband radio to a Christmas re-union with aunts , uncles , and cousins . The cousins were all younger , and the grown-ups to old , so I was sitting in a corner with my headphones on , scanning the shortwave bands . I happened to be sitting on WWV when my aunt said " Hey , Chuck . What are you listening to tonight ? " I just pulled the headphone plug , turned up the volume , and played " tock , tock , tock , PEEP , toooone . " Then I put the phones back in , and smiled at her . If she suspected that I was weird before that , now she had her proof . <p> I must have first heard WWV shortly after putting together the Knight-Kit Span Master I received for Christmas 1963 . I still have my log books from my high school days , which include an entry for Radio Habana on 29 December 1963 for which I subsequently received a QSL card . But I guess I did n't  log all my receptions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year of WWVs operation from Greenbelt , Maryland ( on government land that subsequently became the site of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center ) . I have a QSL card for the reception of the 5 MHz signal featuring a drawing ( in pink ) of the Jefferson Memorial . The next entry is dated 1 December 1966 , the first day of WWVs operation from Fort Collins , Colorado . I have one of the special QSL cards issued for confirmation of first-day reception for my report on the 20 and 25 MHz signals . I 'm sure I heard WWVH early on too but my first log entry is dated 29 March 1967 . I never did QSL them . <p> 1970 , on a Longines Symphonette multi-band portable . I was rather surprised to hear a " radio clock , " so to speak . As a young teen who had just begun to discover the world of shortwave radio , WWV and its cousins , among them CHU and JJY , made me keep at this new past time as these time stations provided variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This only made my enjoyment of the hobby that much better . <p> 45 years later , I am still in love with shortwave listening . I caught the radio bug , and it its still with me ! <p> It is on an old oddball rim drive recorder . It would not play at the correct speed using a standard capstan drive reel to reel drive . But I am working on it . I have a QSL card from WWVH for that same date . <p> The first time I listened to WWV was in 1997 with a SONY 7600 receiver while I was living in Madrid , Spain . I was just a 16 yo teen and since then I always loved that lond of magic that let us listen to very distant stations = <p> The year was 1964 I was 12 and my receiver was a Marconi CR346 , a model that I cant find anything about online . I 'd been tuning around medium wave for some years to find other stations than the BBC , which had at the time a radio monopoly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had a few hours each week of pop music that I wanted to listen to . I came across many international broadcasters from Europe that announced they also broadcast on shortwave . In particular I listened to Peter Skala of Radio Pragues weekly DX programme which gave a lot of information on shortwave broadcasting . The set came from a local radio/TV dealer , this was a small coastal resort and fishing port and as well as general radio and TV sales/repairs he also got equipment for the local radio amateurs and fishermen . I think it was a second hand one from a fishing family . I came across WWV most likely on 15MHz , thought this was much better than having to phone the speaking clock or wait for a time check on domestic radio . Peter Skala was the radio name of Oldrich Cip who founded the HFCC and is still on its steering board . <p> I think my dad was trying to find out whether or not I might be interested in amateur radio . He borrowed a Mosley CM-1 ( ! ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( too- ) short single-wire antenna in the garage . <p> He did n't  say very much about it , nor did he offer any help or advice , and the ONLY signal I could ever get it to receive was WWV on 15 MHz . <p> I cant remember how many months that radio sat there , occasionally being turned on and its knobs played with , but eventually it was returned to its owner . <p> In 2011 , without thinking of that long-ago episode , I finally decided it was time and got my Tech license . Some months later I upgraded to General , but due to financial limitations and other factors , to this day I 've operated only on 2 meters . <p> In any case , I still I use WWV to set my watch and to know the precise time of the beginning of each new year . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207201 @3907201/ <h> The Eton Satellit : my thoughts after 3 weeks of DXing and some recent catches <p> Hi there , its been about three weeks now since I started DXing with the Eton Satellit and I thought it time to post an updated review , based on my experiences thus far , along with some recent catches . Noting that other radio hobbyists with a strong presence online have been posting neutral to negative reviews on this receiver , I would just like to point out , perhaps rather obviously , that no receiver is perfect and just as importantly , the criteria on which a portable radio is judged will be different from user to user , based on their listening habits . I am- almost exclusively engaged in DXing with the Satellit , whilst others will be listening on the broadcast bands on a more casual basis . I know that for some , the ultimate quality and finish of a- product is as- important as performance and they would make their- physical assessment in a very detailed manner . I on the other hand focus mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does n't  fall apart in my hands , straight out of the box ! That actually happened and its sort of where I draw the line = I guess the point is , I try to respect everyones opinion , irrespective as to whether we are in agreement or not and I believe that 's healthy for the future of our hobby . <p> Ok , back to the Satellit . Firstly , I am able to confirm that in terms of ultimate sensitivity , this portable is very close to my Sony ICF-2001D one of the most highly regarded portables ever made . The delta in performance between the two is most- perceptible on the weakest of fading signals that intermittently deliver audio with the Sony , but ca n't be heard on the Eton . On stronger signals , my experience is that either radio might provide the- strongest and or highest fidelity audio . I have a series of comparison videos already in the can , which will be uploaded to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel soon . <p> In terms of selectivity , the digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on the narrowest setting ( 2 kHz ) when operating in a crowded band , adjacent channel QRM can occasionally- still sound quite pronounced , as compared to my Sony ICF-SW55 or ICF-2001D receivers . As regards synchronous detection , this is more of a hit-and-miss affair . Subscribers to my channel might notice that in nearly all of my reception videos featuring- the Eton Satellit , I have not engaged the SYNC . That is n't to say it does n't  work , however , even with selectable sidebands , the SYNC mode often appears to increase the overall signal amplitude and noise floor , without positively influencing- the SNR . However , its interesting to note that- signals on the Satellit in AM mode often almost match- the ICF-2001D in SYNC mode , in terms of overall SNR . More on that to come . <p> There are a number of ways to tune the radio ; manually using the tuning knob ( and this has a decent feel/ resistance to it ) , direct frequency input which requires pressing the AM button to engage , automatic search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages . In the real world and by that I mean my world which is most often in the middle of a field , or the woods , all of the above tuning options are as ergonomic as most of my- other portables . With regard to SSB reception , there are fast , slow and fine tuning options with a maximum resolution of 10 Hz and this works very well to reproduce natural sounding speech in LSB and USB modes . The tuning speed/fine options are engaged by pressing the tuning knob inwards towards the set quite a neat idea . With SSB and SYNC there 's always a little pause whilst the electronics engage a set of chevrons appear on the screen to indicate the receiver is actually doing something . Its similar to the Sony ICF-SW77 where you effectively- toggle between SYNC USB and LSB and wait for lock . Not an issue for me , but it might annoy some , particularly those who have experience with the ICF-2001D , where SYNC engagement is instantaneous , if the signal is of sufficient strength . A small point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall , a brilliant little radio that in my opinion is completely worthy of the Satellit branding , at least in terms of ultimate performance . As I mentioned previously , one of the most experienced DXers I know , with more than 3 decades of listening to the HF bands and an owner of a number of vintage Satellit receivers noted that the Eton Satellit outperformed them and by some margin . To further demonstrate this , I have included links to recent reception videos . In particular , I copied three- of the regional AIR stations with signal strength and clarity that had never previously been obtained . I also copied HM01 , the Cuban Numbers Station for the first time on the 11 metre broadcast band , Sudan and Guinea on the 31 metre broadcast band ( a whopping signal from Guinea ) and Polski Radio 1 on longwave . I hope you find them interesting . Since featuring the Satellit on my channel , one of two of my subscribers have purchased this radio and thus far have been very happy indeed with its performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone interested in DXing and in particular those that embark on DXpeditions . I just hope that should you decide to buy one , you receive an example that performs was well as mine . Embedded reception videos and text links follow below , In the mean time and until my next post , I wish you all great DX ! 42385 @qwx662385 <p> With this article you have reinstated this radios reputation to a part of the market as to which Eton had intended which was for DXERS , and very demanding enthusiasts . People can now read this article and watch the videos and make up their own minds this is how it should be , very commendable indeed . 73 Tom . <p> I completely agree , Thomas . Clint has done a fine job help bring this radio to the attention of DXers . I think its important to stress that interested DXers buy the Satellit from new , or newer-used inventory . A firmware update in the 2nd half of 2015 mostly fixed the soft mute issues . Evidently the antenna input jack has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eham.net reviewer Terry , KT7DX describes the changes he observed : http : **35;177;TOOLONG . Other changes improved the LCD screens readability in direct sunlight , and the Sync-AMs performance no longer depends on the setting of the SSB modes fine tuning adjustment . <p> I hope to make some comparisons between the Eton Satellit and other radios on a DXpedition in a couple of weeks . However , some quick tests between the Satellit and a Panasonic RF-B65 at home have shown the receivers to be nearly identical in sensitivity on their whip antennas . <p> Thanks for the excellent review and the attention the you 're all giving this new radio . It appears my wallet is vulnerable yet again . I am a fan of Grindig Satellits despite some rather difficult Grindig experience in the past . What I really need to know is , is it pronounced Satell " it " or Satell " ite " ? <p> Like Clint I too am a fan of this little radio . Its very sensitive on SW and MW , works well on FM too with the RDS displaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio in this class which does this ) . The sound quality is great for such a small radio . That gorgeous orange display was love at first sight for me = <p> That being said there are a couple of things I do n't  like : <p> The Sync feature is garbage . Do n't  buy this radio if you absolutely need sync . For some reason they cant make sync working properly on these DSP radios . Its the same on the Tecsun PL-880 but at least they never advertised sync on that radio because they probably realized it does n't  work well at all . <p> I bought the radio new a few months ago so it must have the new firmware . But muting is still very noticeable when tuning . I do n't  mind it too much and I can live with it but I ca n't figure out why they did n't  get rid of the muting completely . Is this a " feature " of the DSP chips ? Do they need to add special circuitry just to disable the muting ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuning you 'll probably hate the muting . <p> My unit is deaf on LW . Really deaf . From what I saw on Clints videos his unit is better . He received Poland on 225 kHz while being in Italy . I 'm much closer to Poland but I cant hear a thing on 225 kHz on the Satellit. 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207202 @3907202/ <h> Review of the SSTRAN AMT3000 AM transmitter kit <p> Regular SWLing Post readers know that I 'm a sucker for vintage radios " " especially those of the WWII era . Indeed , - I 'm pretty much a fan of anything from the 1930s and 40s . I love the technology of that era and have an affinity for the culture and history , especially film and music . <p> Scottie ( yep , I call her Scottie ) produces beautiful , rich audio from her internal speaker . Its truly an amazing piece of over-engineered technology that still sounds this good after 70 years . <p> Edythe Wright <p> Only a week or so after plugging Scottie into an antenna , my wife and I picked up a $1 CD at a church- yard sale . The CD featured- big band music from the late 30s/early 40s . Though we already had much of the music on the CD , we bought it anyway to keep- in our car . One beautiful fall day , I was driving down a rural road and had the CD playing- when- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Round " with- Edythe Wright on vocals , began playing . It had been ages since I heard this songI then wondered how many GIs might have heard this song during WWII via GI Jive or the Armed Forces Radio Network . Perhaps they heard it on the Navy version of my Scott Marine radio , the Navy REH ? <p> It was then I decided to finally pull the trigger and order a proper low-power AM transmitter for our- home " " something with which I could broadcast period music via my vintage gear . <p> There are a number of AM transmitters on the market , but the one that always stands out from the crowd is the SSTRAN AMT3000 . My buddy , The Professor , has one and uses it to consume much- of his digital audio content including podcasts and Internet radio stations . He sang the AMT3000s praises , and I trust the Prof ; he s something of a medium wave guru . <p> Thing is , the AMT3000 only ships as a kit . In the past , this had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than my beginner kit-building skills could manage . But after building David Cripes Ozark Patrol regenerative receiver , - and loving the experience , - I felt confident enough to make the order . <p> And , boy , am I glad I did ! <h> The SSTRAN AMT3000 kit <p> The kit arrived within a few days of ordering it . Upon unboxing it , I felt like I had gotten my moneys worth , as it was packaged carefully in a quality box : components were clearly labelled in their own poly bags , the board was clearly marked with component numbers and the assembly/instruction manual was in a plastic binder , all clear and straightforward . <p> SSTRAN suggests taking your time building the kit , as there are a lot of components to solder , and you risk making mistakes that are n't  necessarily easy to remedy- if you rush through the process . I tried to follow this advice " " well , I intended to follow this advice . Thing is , I find it- very difficult to put down a kit once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more quickly than I intended . <p> But it helped that SSTRAN took out a lot of the head-scratching and guesswork ; - the process couldnt have been more smooth . I carefully checked and double-checked each component and marked it off the assembly list . First , you install all of the resistors , then capacitors , and on to other components . Other than having to hunt for some of the component locations on the board , it really was quite simple . <p> I started building the kit on a Friday afternoon and actually finished it the following Saturday morning . Much to my delight , after performing the tuning procedure , the transmitter worked on the first go . Whew ! <h> Powerful ( low power ) broadcasting <p> The AMT3000 can be configured to work with the supplied simple wire antenna , which will essentially broadcast AM to radios throughout your home , or it can be configured for a Part 15 compliant outdoor base-loaded vertical antenna which will extend your range up to 3/4 of a mile , should your shack be down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , I have my transmitter set up for in-house broadcasting- only . - If I ever want to build the base-loaded vertical , I only need to make a simple modification to the board to do so . <p> The supplied manual does a great job of explaining the best ways to maximize your signal , reduce any electrical hum and tweak your audio fidelity . <p> Ive been using the AMT3000 nearly every day since I finished building it in mid-November . It seems to have a 100% duty cycle , does not overheat , and has no drift . <p> It produces high fidelity audio with a flat frequency response " " and- of course , with modulation and compression controls , you can tailor the audio to your particular taste . <p> As a bonus , I can hook my shortwave receivers up to the AMT3000 and listen to received audio via other radios throughout my house . Many times , I 've listened to live broadcasts of ERT Open on 9,420 kHz via my kitchen AM radioVery cool ! <p> I set my transmitter to 1410 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do a medium wave ( AM ) survey to find the clearest spot on your AM dial . I 'm sure results will vary , depending on the level of medium wave broadcast activity in your area . <h> Conclusion <p> If you 're looking for a high-quality , low-power legal AM transmitter , I highly recommend the SSTRAN AMT3000 . Even if you 're a novice kit builder , with time and patience , you can successfully construct the AMT3000 , too . If I did it , you certainly can ! <p> If you 'd prefer buying a pre-assembled AMT3000 , they do occasionally turn up on eBay . Click here to search . <p> As for me , I 'm happy to have achieved my modest goal of being able to broadcast 1930s and 1940s music to- vintage radios of the same era. 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 8 thoughts on " Review of the SSTRAN AMT3000 AM transmitter kit " <p> It sounds wonderful Thomas and your SLR-M is quite looker , too ! I had an AMT-300 a few years ago and agree with your assessment . A quality kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio processing too . <p> The SSTran kit was one of my best purchases . It allows me to use my vintage radios daily , and actually enjoy what I 'm listening to . Im impressed at how well the resulting broadcast sounds through my 1956 Blaupunkt Granada . The AMT3000 seems to broadcast a wider bandwidth than most current local MW broadcasters . It reminds me of the old KOMA 1520 back when I was a kid .

@@75207205 @3907205/ <p> Hi there , if you 're a subscriber to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel , you will be aware that- I have been using a Wellbrook ALA1530 H field antenna , for 15 months or so , with ( at times ) excellent results . A while back I was on the lookout for a second antenna , however at more than -250 , I could n't justify purchasing a second Wellbrook . Ultimately I splashed out on the Bonito Boni whip E-field wideband active antenna ( 20 kHz to 300 MHz ) and with a very compact form-factor suitable for DXpeditions/portable operation in general , the Boni whip definitely ticked all the boxes . Furthermore , with reasonable second and third order intercept points of +55 and +32.5 dBm respectively , the Boni whip , on paper at least , looked like a pretty good buy at around -100 . <p> - <p> Initial testing at home confirmed , perhaps not surprisingly that the Boni whip could not match the- SNR provided by the Wellbrook ALA1530 in a noisy , urban environment . However , less predictably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna away from the ubiquitous blanket of electrosmog at my QTH . Furthermore , it really is so compact , I simply- leave it in the car in- a small- flight case , with a portable and connectors etc. for ad-hoc listening sessions . Since returning- from my most recent trip to Brazil , I have had a chance to review my most recent catches with the Boni whip , some of which are realy pleasing and most definitely underline the excellent performance of this diminutive antenna . In particular , signals from Radio RB2 - on 11935 kHz and Radio Aparecida on 11855 kHz , both low power Brazilian stations , are testament to how sensitive the Boni whip is in an electrically quiet environment . Check out also the quality of longwave signals from Poland and the- Czech Republic- - simply amazing for such a physically short antenna . Finally , there 's a personal first from Lusaka , Zambia , Voice of Hope Africa on 13680 kHz . All the more rewarding that this was actually copied in my work office ! <p> I hope you found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text links for all , which will take you directly to the relevant video on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel .

Now , I 'm sure many of you know from your own experiences that DXing from a noisy hotel room can be just about impossible and so it was in the main . I did however manage to copy a very nice signal from BBC Radio 5 Live on 693 kHz medium wave and Cha+ne 3 , from Tipaza , Algeria on 252 kHz the latter is a much more difficult catch back in the UK . Reception videos for these two signals also follow below and I have to say that given the very noisy environment , this was a pleasing result using the Etons internal ferrite antenna . Prior to my trip this week , I recorded a really nice signal from Radio Nacional Brasilia on 11780 kHz- and- the best signal from North Korea ( Voice of Korea KCBS ) I 've ever copied on the 41 metre broadcast band . Both are testament to- the Eton Satellits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-core DXing capabilities . Finally , what now feels a very poignant recording , I managed to catch ABC Northern Territories on 2325 , 2485 and 4835 kHz during the same session- and on one reception video . Embedded videos and text links to- these videos on Oxford Shortwave Log follow below , along with a brief video review of the main functions and features of the Satellit . <p> With regard to the closure of ABC on shortwave , my full support goes out Senator Nick Xeonophon- and his quest to introduce new legislation to force the ABC to reinstate their shortwave transmissions . There , I 've said it and that 's enough politics for now lol . In the meantime , my plans to test the Eton Satellit against more established DXing portables remain in place and work commitments allowing , this should happen soon . Thanks for **26;242;TOOLONG and I wish you all great DX ! 42385 @qwx662385 <p> LONG ... brilliant little Tecsun PL-310ET : serious DXing on a budget part LONG ... LONG ... 28 Nov 2016 17:06:48 +0000http : //swling.com/blog/ ? p=22438Hi there , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently that his little Tecsun PL-310ET was proving to be an- excellent receiver and that it would- suit my DXpedition activities . Now , as someone who likes to push the envelope of performance with sophisticated- portables , usually coupled to- very large antennas , a cheap little Tecsun might- not have been an abvious choice for my next purchase . However , Mr Brogan ( who has an excellent Youtube channel by the same name check out his wonderful collection of vintage and modern receivers ) previously suggested I buy , for similar reasons , the Sony ICF-SW100 . That little masterpiece of electronics turned out to be one of the best receivers I 've ever owned . I felt compelled to take notice because Tom never gets- this stuff wrong ! A few days later I found myself in Maplins again and there it was on the shelf at just under -40 , so I bought one . <p> I got back into shortwave listening about 18 months ago , after many years of inactivity whilst my poor Sangean ATS-803A rotted away in the garden shed and Sony ICF-7600G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought a Tecsun PL-360. - What a great little portable that turned out to be there are over 100 reception videos on my YouTube channel demonstrating how it continually performed above and beyond the very modest price tag . I even managed to hear ABC Northern Territories 4835 kHz on it once - simply amazing for a receiver under -30 . Given my extensive experience with the PL-360 and having learned the PL-310ET shared the same DSP chip , I was expecting the same , or at least very similar performance and the only real benefit to upgrading to the PL-310ET was the direct frequency access . - However , I was wrong about that ! <p> The brilliant Tecsun PL-360 got me back into shortwave radio for less than -30 <p> About a week after buying the PL-310ET , - I managed to get out on a DXpedition and with 30 metres of wire attached to it via the external antenna socket , I started tuning around the SW bands . Quite simply , I was amazed at the sensitivity and selectivity of this diminutive little portable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio bandwidth filter options - from 1 to 6 kHz , coupled with direct frequency access via the keypad , it was a joy to use and listen to . In just over- an hour I had - copied signals from North Korea , including their internal service KCBS Pyongyang , Zanzibar BC , ABC Northern Territories ( at the first attempt ! ) , Zambia NBC Radio 1 , Radio Oromiya and Radio Amhara from Ethiopia , amongst others . Brilliant stuff and clearly demonstrating that the overall hardware/software package with the PL-310ET is a step up in performance over the PL-360 and capable of proper DX for a very modest outlay . Interestingly , in a conversation with Thomas Witherspoon regarding the PL-310ET , he reminded me that it was one of his go-to radios for travelling and confirmed its excellent performance. - - I would definitely recommend this radio to novices and experts alike . <p> Reception videos follow below , with more to come in part 2 ; I hope you enjoy them . Thanks for watching/listening and I wish you all excellent DX ! 42385 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about a year now and in that time it has demonstrated a level of performance way beyond my expectations . Notwithstanding its incredibly small size ( about the same as a packet of cigarettes , give-or-take ) , the DX results I have obtained with it are simply incredible . A fully featured ultra-portable receiver , complete with synchronous detection , selectable side bands , SSB , CW and- coupled with sensitivity that has my ( wonderful ) Sony ICF-SW55 beat and knocks on the door of the legendary ICF2001D . I simply cant recommend it highly enough . Plug in some headphones or connect an external speaker such as the Bose SoundLink Mini 2 and you effectively have table-top receiver performance and audio in a very compact package . <p> Originally introduced into the market in 1993 and discontinued in 2005 , this little radio covers the broadcast FM band from 76 to 108 MHz and AM from 150 to 29999 kHz , continuously . There are numerous other features that I wont list here as they 're available on the web , but suffice to say , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely never to be repeated . They are available on eBay and prices remain robust for a radio that will be one to two decades old . Of course there 's also the issue on the first generation models with the ribbon cable connecting the lid of the set with the LCD display etc. to the base , which would fracture after some time , but this was rectified in later models with a notch cut out of the hinge to reduce the stress on the cable see photo . They are also repairable and in fact I believe Thomas has a posting on here detailing how the ribbon cable on his example was replaced . In my opinion , this receiver is worth the hassle of a repair , because its quite simply unique . <p> Below are selected reception videos from my youtube channel Oxford Shortwave Log using the Sony ICF-SW100 , which I believe epitomise the performance of this great little portable . Thanks for watching/ listening . 42385 @qwx662385 <p> As it turns out , one user from here helped me plot it , the shortest path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pyongyang right through the small village I live in ! So that answers why some of their are so glaringly strong for me . But , I can in general , hear them all day everyday at some level on a frequency if I look hard enough and try hard enough to pick them up . <p> Listen to that noise that starts about 6 seconds into this clip , disappears at about 26 seconds and then comes back at 39 seconds . It disappears at 44 seconds and comes back at about 48/49 seconds . It disappears at 52 seconds and comes back at 1 minute 1 seconds , then the interval tune starts , gets interrupted and restarts again from the beginning . <p> To me , when the interval signal dies out and the noise goes with it , its almost like this white/dirty noise carrier is caused by whatever they are using as a studio to transmitter link . <p> Now onto some other North Korea shortwave airchecks : <p> Here is an example of how wide their signals can be and what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kHz at 0946UTC on June 30th .

Audio here : - https : //goo.gl/TacYT0 <p> A few tips when looking for The Voice Of Korea on your shortwave radios : <p> The service always begins within seconds of exactly 30 minutes after the hour , with the interval tone interspersed with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language service is about to sign on . At about 24 after , a sign off message lasting roughly 3 minutes is read in the language of whatever service was on . If the frequency you 're listening will switch to another service at 30 after the hour , the carrier goes dead/unmodulated for almost exactly 3 minutes before the next language comes on . And the process is repeated over again . <p> The English service sign off message is read by a male in very stilted , very proper english . It sounds as if the French , German and Spanish service is voiced by people who could very well be native speakers of those languages . <p> There is no carrier being turned off or fill music being used between different language services on Shortwave . And when they go dead air , the carrier will be extremely noisy and dirty , see my first audio clip in this post . <p> The KCBS Pyongyang broadcasts , which are their domestic/state broadcast go from top of hour to top of hour and I do n't  believe there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pyongyang time ( an " official " time zone ) is UTC/GMT +8 hours 30 minutes and that 's the time zone KCBS Pyongyang followed , but it appears Voice of Korea follows the UTC+8 time zone deal . Voice of Korea does n't  signify top of hour with any tones , but KCBS Pyongyang does , as I 've heard them do it 3 times . - Listen to the time tones on KCBS Pyongyang 3320 kHz here : - https : //goo.gl/2MbE6Y- ( They are at the very beginning of the clip ) <p> North Koreas shortwave signals , in my observations , have followed the time and frequency schedules they are supposed to . Some- sites say the- language service and frequency- do n't  match up , but that is likely more a problem with the VOK website than the shortwave broadcaster itself . If a frequency is listed as " on , " its going to be on unless a power outage or transmitter malfunction occurs . <p> I live in Galena , Alaska which is a village of 500 people about 300 miles west of Fairbanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Program Director for community radio station KIYU- which celebrated its 30th birthday on July 4th , 2016 .

Jim has been working on board the- USNS Sgt William R Button- since mid-June . While on board Jim has no web access , but he can send and receive emails and some files . I kept Jim informed about the time and frequencies of the BAS broadcast . <p> Jim had hoped to make a recording of the Midwinter broadcast at sea , but timing and some technical problems got in the way and he missed the bulk of the 30 minute program . <p> That 's okay , though , because Jim is an avid SWL and ham radio operator .

In some respects it sounds clearer on SSB then the 2010 . Now my 2010 has been handled over the years with great care . But compared to the GP5 it is starting to show its age .

The Degen is the only radio Ive taken with me to the Shetlands , Orkney and the Outer Hebrides ( I 'm a bird watcher ) and its been a solid , reliable performer throughout on all bands far from home .

" <h> 6 thoughts on " FCC : Remarks on the Growth of Pirate Radio " <p> If you look at the " pirate radio type " enforcement actions by the FCC you 'll notice that lots are for unlicensed FM broadcast stations .

Interesting that some of these stations are operated out of apartments in multi-family buildings . And its pretty easy to purchase one of these illegal FM transmitters with output power greater than allowed by the FCC . <p> Fire Wheeler . In fact , fire the FCC . This attempt to silence pirate radio is merely an example of governments doing what they do best , coerce and intimidate . Why does one have to give their SSN to receive an amateur license ?

@@75207215 @3907215/ <h> Bobs review of the C.Crane CC Skywave <p> Well , I just received my new CC Skywave radio and it 's terrific ! I own a lot of portable radios ( including several Tecsun DSP sets ) , and the Skywave is a new favorite and will likely become my standard radio for travel . <p> Good fit and finish , great ergonomics , and easy to use . I was pleased to find that , despite what 's written in the ads and on the back of the radio , you can set the radio to receive FM down to 76 MHz by selecting the a 9 kHz MW spacing . <p> Great for international travel . The following is my brief review ( by band ) : <p> Mediumwave <p> The Skywave is far better than any of the Tecsuns and is almost as good as the C Crane 2E ( my best MW receiver ) . At my location ( 40 miles N of Chicago ) , the distant groundwave fringe includes WLW , WJR , and KTRS ( St. Louis ) " in descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper of WLW ( though not discernible ) , while the other two are rare . The C Crane 2E gets WLW and WJR well enough that you can listen ; KTRS is detectable . The Skywave gets WLW and WJR and you can tell that KTRS is there . That indicates that the Skywave is among the best . And there are no birdies nor whistles on the band . Nice . <p> FM <p> Just as sensitive and about 99% as selective as any of the Tecsun DSPs . The shorter antenna does n't seem to hamper reception at all . And , with no soft muting and a more logical tuning setup , it 's a pleasure to work with . Lastly , the stereo reception threshold on the C Crane DSP chip is significantly lower than that on any of the Tecsun rigs , so most signals decode stereo and simply sound better . Where I live , I have tons of signals that are 0.2 MHz apart ( i.e. 101.9 Chicago , 102.1 Milwaukee , 102.3 Waukegan " and local ) " the Skywave has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three . <p> Shortwave <p> Seems to do just fine . I have not had any overload issues with my unit and can pull in all as many SW signals and most of my other small portables . The lack of SSB is an inconvenience , I suppose , but I guess you ca n't have it all ! <p> NOAA/Weather radio <p> This band is great to have and is perfectly functional . I will say that this is n't my most sensitive WB radio , but it 's not deaf by any definition . It 's just a little less sensitive to distant fringe WB stations than some of my other sets . But it does dependably pull in anything within 60 miles , so we 're only talking about ability to pull in distant fringe signals ( which can be fun ) . <p> Air <p> I 've played around with this a little and it definitely works better than expected . O'Hare tower is about 25 miles away and I get it clearly , along with aircraft that are ( from what I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scan is very helpful ; however , catching a signal when someone is broadcasting is tricky . A little online research into local ATC frequencies goes a long way toward having fun on this band . The Skywave seems to work the Air Band better than the G6 and G3 , my only other radios with this band . <p> So , overall , this radio has been a very pleasant surprise . No disappointments whatsoever. - Kudos to C Crane Company for doing such a fine job with yet another radio . <p> That 's an excellent tip about widening- the FM frequency range down to 76 MHz by selecting 9 kHz steps on mediumwave . Brilliant ! <p> Readers should be aware that some Skywave owners have noted a- vulnerability to overloading and imaging in urban markets or where blowtorch stations are nearby . If your listening post fits this description , you may want to hold off until C.Crane has addressed the issue . <p> I guess with the overload problem , either an AGC control or a RF control , or both is needed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative ( overload ) reviews . All the negative reviews harp on the overload for the lack of a local/DX switch . I passed on this set due to having 11 AM stations within 15mi some 5kW . <p> With that many AM stations nearby , passing on the CC Skywave ( at least , until the overloading problem is solved ) makes sense to me . Again , I have yet to experience it , but a lot of that has to do with where I live and my travel patterns . -Thomas <p> So far , I have not run into any overload issues . Perhaps this is an issue if you happen to be within a couple of miles of a blowtorch AM signal . I will certainly comment if I end up using the Skywave in such a location . <p> I travel a lot and have been carrying the Skywave with me on my trips . So far , I have come away even more impressed than before . The Air Band is most definitely more sensitive than in the Grundig G3 or G6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity has , so far , been better than in any car radio I 've compared it to ( and I include a couple of different rental cars on that list ) . The shorter antenna does not seem to be a handicap in the least , clearly the receiver was designed with this in mind . <p> Lastly , the MW band is sensitive enough that I could get a whisper of CFZM Toronto from Tupelo , MS at night ( despite lots of co-channel competition ) . From central IL ( Champaign ) , daytime groundwave reception included several signals from St. Louis , Indianapolis , WLW Cincinnati , WHAS Louisville , WTMJ Milwaukee , a whisper of WISN Milwaukee and most everything from the Chicago area ( the 50 kw signals are easy from central IL , but the local-type signals are not ) . <p> Basically , its an awesome little package for a traveler and it has rapidly become my new favorite radio . No quibbles as yet . <p> No , the Bob that wrote this review lives in the UK and has no affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think C.Crane would ever act as a shill ( and if they did , I 'm sure they would n't I 'd themselves ! ) . = <p> Funny , though : I have been submitted reviews before that were obviously shills .

I believe this seller is simply implying that stored memories are not volatile when the batteries are removed or the radio is turned off . I could be wrong , but that 's what I think they mean . <p> Thanks for the feedback . Can you please check this when you get to your receiver ? If its writable normal memories they mean , then its a totally different manner of course . How is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like multiple ebay sellers are marketing the 1103 as version 1.0 ( non-dsp ) and version 2.0 ( dsp ) . <p> like that ! <p> If I want a non-dsp version , its easy to pick it out ! Also , the station frequencies are NOT pre-loaded in the radio . Again , translation into english is n't the best , but what they mean is that when you replace the batteries , the only thing that must be reset is the clock . <p> I am more tolerant of DSP dropping in and out on audio , but DTV with video freezing and turning into mosaic is unacceptable . The mind has a way of filling in the ditches with QSB and even a little interference with pictures on video , But I think the digital world has not fully thought out the you can compensate for a bad picture or sound down to a certain level but loosing a few words of a sentence can loose the meaning of the whole story . <p> I 'm always surprised with the gushing reviews on the DEGEN-1103 ( Non-DSP model ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " great " receiver . <p> It is n't not a by a long shot . <p> A few points : <p> The noise floor is very high The front end gets swamped easily with or without an external antenna Ergonomics are atrocious ( no dedicated volume button seriously ? ) Build quality is cheap and nasty Selectivity is average FM is very good , MW acceptable but SW is hit and miss SSB is prone to distortion ( AGC issues ) and never resolves clearly <p> The DSP model appears worse in performance which does n't  surprise me . A no buy for me . <p> Jason , my experience does NOT match your first two items at all . Noise floor is nice and low , and overload has never been an issue . SW has always been constantly good , across any frequency . I 've often compared mine to other recievers side by side and the 1103 always matches or exceeds them . <p> Unfortunately , I agree with the rest of your list . The ergonomics of combined tuning + volume knob are horrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital radio is pointless and infuriating . I hate using it . Buttons fail after a couple years and the display goes bad . I would n't recommend anyone buy it , for those reasons alone , but the SW reception is still very good . <p> I think the inconsistent reviews of this radio can be traced back to the poor QC of Degen/Kaito . A friend sent me my Kaito KA1103 ( same as this Degen ) and I understand he had the seller check multiple units to find one with consistent quality . <p> Overall , its fantastic , aside from a bit of inaccuracy on the FM band . If I 'm listening to a station that 's at 94.9 MHz , for example , its tuned dead center on 94.82 MHz instead . But as far as MW/SW performance , its really quite stout with the built-in antenna and has great sound quality . I 'm actually listening to WRMI on 5850 right now on it , and they 're playing What Does The Fox Say for some strange reason , but it sounds top notch for a SW receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my local AM if I use my external 30-35 foot longwire , but that local AM is only 1500 feet away and runs 2.5 kW during the day .

@@75207223 @3907223/ <p> Which begs the question : is this prison-quality radio really that good ? I ask the question only because a good AM-FM prison radio must perform exceptionally well behind formidable prison walls . After all , nearly one percent of the US population is currently behind bars ( down slightly from 2008 ) which is a substantial pocket radio market . Prison radios are typical sold in prison commissaries and prisons are big business nowadays . How does this radio compare to the famous Sony SRF-39FP ? Inquiring minds want to know .

Does it beat the Sony ? <p> I , too , am very curious how it will compare with the SRF-39FP in terms of battery longevity , audio fidelity , and overall performance . <p> I suspect the SRF-39FP will remain dominant on the AM broadcast band and possibly have better battery life ( keep in mind , the SRF-39FP only uses one AA batterythe DT-160CL requires two ) . <p> As soon as I receive the DT-160CL ( Amazon notes- delivery will be Wednesday , August 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sony SRF-39FP , set them to the same volume level and frequency , then allow them to run continuously until the batteries are depleted .

He kindly agreed ! <p> Lyle writes : <p> I worked a DX station 9A1A on 10 meters this past spring . - As the band improved , I heard an echo develop on his signal and guessed it might be long path so I began recording the audio . - I then began to hear a double echo and looked at the waveform on AUDACITY. - The timing marks on AUDACITY indicated 140 milliseconds between echos . <p> I went to Wolfram Alfa , one of my go-to sights for things I cant remember , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me the distance but also the time to travel it at the speed of light , - 133 milliseconds. - Not sure if everyone working DX has heard this sort of thing , I played the recording at the next East Tennessee - DX Association meeting . - Nobody said they had heard that kind of double echo . <p> First of all I have n't updated my website for some time as I am extremely busy . Re the echo , some 20 25 years ago I was tuning around either on the 60M or 49M band and the BBC was coming like that and actually with a longer time which I calculated at about half a second or slightly a bit more between the signals . Pity that I did n't  have the tape recorder operating at the time but I realy wished I had as this is not something that occurs every day and maybe you will get it once in a lifetime .

I do not believe that its intentional , because the effect does not seem to last very long . I 've heard it show up mid-sentence and disappear before the OM completes the transmission . <p> About 2-3 years ago during the winter , I heard an echo of my own signal while on 80 meters SSB .

Thomas has written numerous articles for TSM , and will attest to its emphasis on so many aspects of the radio hobby . If you are not a subscriber already you really do not know what you are missing ! <p> The program boasts over 75 modes , not counting some of the many sub-modes or variations , and new modes are being added all the time .

As I have noted on my blog and in the article itself , I consider the registration fee some of the best money I have ever spent for computer software . <p> As an added bonus , the free or registered version can be run on as many computers as you have in your home , and multiple instances of the program can be run on the same computer provided they are in separate directories . This is a great feature , and it means there is basically nothing going into the Windows registry filethe program runs right from the directory .

After a one year hiatus , HTO never assumed I could have forgotten the material I learned last yearbad assumption ! - ( ha ha ! ) Only a day before the exam , I realized I had forgotten some of the initial study material , so I forced HTO to test me on it by selecting only the first element for study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should re-check course material after an extended hiatus ? <p> Obviously , the HTO training method worksI was able to pass my Extra Exam with only about 30 hours of total study time . - I 'm pretty sure I could n't have achieved that with booksespecially on such short orderand I know of no other web-based platforms like it on the market readers : please correct me if I 'm wrong . <p> HTO is efficient and cost-effectiveespecially for those of us with an active family life .

As always , an Amateur Radio license is a license to learn , at whatever level we are . We take things which are new , barely grasped , and we begin to use them over time , and then suddenly they make sense . I host a Newcomers and Elmers Net each week where we encourage Newcomers to get on the air and ask questions , while the Elmers ( radio mentors ) are there to help with answers . We also have a topic for discussion each week so that there is always something being discussed if questions are slow to come in . I have learned far more through teaching these sessions than I could have learned just through testing alone . and of course , actually exploring various aspects of the hobby makes the test material real .

Imagine receivers scatted around the world South America , Tropical Asia , Africa ! The cost is now virtualy nothing , all that is needed is the dongle , antenna ( does n't  have to be anything special even a long wire or whip ) and a small low cost CPU ( Raspberry Pie for example ) .

Had this not been my fathers routine , I 'm not so sure I would have known what- shortwave radio was for many years . <p> Indeed , I 'm so fond of WWV , that I have to make a modest confession : I often tune it in simply to listen to its predictably reassuring announcements of the time . Somehow it calms and comforts me that all is right on the airwaves . <p> Actually , WWV is and has always been much more than simply a time station . It is the most reliable way for us here in North America to check propagation characteristics both by listening to the signal strengths of the transmissions on 5 , 10 , 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at specific times throughout the day . <p> Lately , WWV has even been announcing test tsunami warnings . It was the search for broadcasts of these warnings that lead me to Myke Dodge Weiskopfs site , Myke.me .

The accompanying track notes alone provide a very complete history of the these NIST stations , and are the perfect companion to the audio tracks . <p> Indeed , I liken this audio journey to learning some untold life experience of a good friend or family member . WWV has been my radio companion all these years , but until I encountered Mykes archive I had never heard the many voices of the station , leap seconds , experimental formats , etc .

He received his training during World War II he was a radar technician and operator stationed in Florida . Later , as the economy was adjusting , he found a nitch as a television and radio repairman . He was also licensed as an amateur radio operator . <p> I think some of this rubbed off on me ! I would listen to my dads receivers to all sorts of short wave stations and amateur radio operations . I even remember listening to Mississippi River barge traffic and even caught number stations in the utility areas of shortwave These were heard on old tube type receivers like the Hallicrafters and military receivers . <p> My first shortwave receiver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old tube rigs it was ! Digital readout and memories ! With precise tuning and lock on frequency , it was a dream to use . This really piqued my interest and since I was a CBer at the time , HAM radio was just a written test away , including 13 word per minute Morse Code to get my general license . <p> Electrons must have rubbed off on me from my dad as I dove into repairing electronics . I did this mainly to keep my own radios going and repair them if they broke down . This included building of antennas for both receive and transmit , from my understanding of amateur radio . <p> Some- 20 years later- my SONY 2010 lost its ability to hear signals . It was the usual FET front end failure and since mine was an early example it did not have the protective diode protection . <p> Taking the radio apart was pretty simple and on-line resources told me where to look . Radio Shack carried a decent FET replacement , and in short order I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the rather dim LED back light ! <p> Around this time I had joined the Yahoo users group for the SONY ICF-2010 and it was not too many years that owners were looking for someone to repair their receivers . I answered a few help wanted ads found on the group . Word spread and suddenly I found myself in the repair and maintenance of the wonderful SONY 2010 ! <p> I was receiving five to ten packages a month of receivers to be repaired , not only the 2010 but others like the ICF-SW7600 , SW55 , SW77 and the SW100 . Panasonics , Grundigs and Kenwood receivers also make their way to me ! <p> The biggest problem was finding parts for all these radios . SONY was not making- or stocking parts and the few warehouses were running low . I had to think fast so I went to places like Ebay , thrift stores and HAMfests to find parts radios to get my customers receiver working again . Most of these finds were fully restorable and I could easily sell them for a nice profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which receivers do you personally own , or have you owned , that you have the highest respect for in terms of their design ? <p> I have eight working 2010s as of this writing . and once in a while I will sell one ! <p> What challenges exist today standing in the way of being able to repair these classic radios are capacitors and other small components still available , and if so from where ? <p> Capacitor problems on the SONY receivers are the worst as the damage can be extensive . Only around 50% of SW77s survive this calamity . One of the worst problems for all portable radios is battery leakage . This can be very destructive to the copper traces and components . <p> How are your family members toward this kind of work you do it does bring in extra cash , so are they supportive ? <p> My wife is very supportive with this venture and she keeps the books on this business . <p> What role has the Internet and specific Yahoo groups played in your getting business from collectors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash heap ? <p> Thanks to the Internet , IRC chat and Yahoo groups , communication connects me to customers and I do not advertise as I consider this a hobby . Since I have been doing this for about ten years , I have repaired at least several hundred SONYs , mostly the 2010 . I just charge a base fee plus return postage . The earnings have paid for the spare parts radios , tools and parts including several solder stations along with a hot air rework unit for surface mount technology . I also use the funds to keep my HAM radio hobby going and make the annual trip to Dayton . I find a few parts receivers there from time to time ! <p> What 's your take at this point on how much longer these classic radios will be able to be fixed ? - Clearly after you end your services to the radio community there will be no one else left ? <p> I consider this a hobby to keep the old receivers going ! I plan on doing this for a while and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discovered a source for the SONY Q303 problem , the original FET is getting scarce and the MPF-102 Radio Shack part is headed that way . My trips to Dayton include a stop at Mendlesons , a rather large surplus outlet that has a huge stock of electronics . There I found a great replacement , close to if not better than the original 2SK152 ! <p> Thanks to Mouser and DigiKey for all the small parts they can supply and they both do small orders ! - I usually can be reached at my best email at- poikaarod@gmail.com- or my ( not so good ) - kb8dns@yahoo.com <p> Finally , if you could put into a few words what drives you when working on these- radios , would you say it comes down a real appreciation or love for the technology- and efforts that companies used to put into manufacturing these radios ? <p> The wonderful memories of sitting in front of the receivers , listening to radio from all over the World , the memories of my dad and all the friends I have made from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will do so for as long as I can ! <h> 6 thoughts on " Guest Post : Profile of Rod Wallberg " <p> Great bio .

Mr. Sauro , tall and lanky could be seen smoking his cigarettes and with his glasses on , working on some TV . Great memories . Thanks for the post . <p> Although Rod says he does repairs on the Sony ICF-2010 for a hobby , as far as his work quality is concerned he is a total professional and takes great pride in his work . He transformed my meh performing 2010 receivers performance to better-than-new including a blue-dot filter upgrade , LED panel lighting , front-end repair / tune-up and antenna protection diodes installed .

The receiver 's external appearance and condition were excellent but the internals had some issues that were beyond my capabilities to address . I almost sent the receiver back to the seller but given the excellent external condition I decided to keep the receiver and sent it to Rod . Rod replaced the LED backlight with a much brighter LED and a color of my choice , installed the diodes for static protection , built-up all the voltage contacts , added a super capacitor for memory back-up , adjusted the sync , cleaned the controls and pots , added a wooden support post for the AA battery terminal which is a known weak point and added a ground wire for the CPU . The receiver works great now and I could not be happier with my decision to keep receiver . I will also add Rod is a great guy to do business with . <p> I just wish to express my gratitude to Rod for repairing my ICF-SW100 Sony which had battery corrosion and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to the SW community internationally .

@@75207249 @3907249/ <h> A travelers review of the Grundig G6 shortwave radio <p> Last week , I traveled to New York City by air and used trains , taxis and buses en route to Philadelphia . All the while , I carted along my luggageand its a good thing I like to travel light . <p> Indeed , I almost never check in luggage , no doubt a remnant of my days as an expatriate , when I was required to travel throughout Europe at a moments notice . But I love traveling with only one bag . Its incredibly liberating . I revel in the challenge of fitting everything I need into one Eagle Creek convertible backpack/suitcase . <p> This latest trip was no exception , and I planned to do a little shortwave and medium wave DX along the way . So which radio did I reach for ? Oddly enough , none of those I listed from my travel radio suggestions , my usual stand-bys . This time , I chose my Grundig G6 . <p> Keypad for direct entry and as with most Grundig radios , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have had a mini Grundig G6 review out for a couple years now in which I praise it highly . I am surprised to find that many other reviewers only give it a lukewarm rating . I believe a lot of this stems from the fact that the radios aircraft band ( 117-137 MHz ) is not terribly sensitive or selective . Since purchasing the G6 , I 've only used the aircraft band onceduring review . I leave aircraft and VHF/UHF listening to a proper scanner , preferably one with triple-conversion circuitry . <p> Yet I find that the Grundig G6 performs quite well on the shortwave and medium wave bands . Last week , while in NYC and Philadelphia , I was surrounded by big signals and did n't  hear many instances of overloading or imaging . Sure , larger portables ( like the Grundig G3 , Tecsun PL-660 , Sony ICF-SW7600GR , Sangean ATS-909X ) will outperform the G6 on SW and MW , but none of those radios can comfortably fit in my pocket . In fact , the G6 is so small that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , tucked among my socks . The portables mentioned above , though reasonably sized , will need some dedicated space . <p> The placement and orientation of the tuning knob on the G6 is genius . My favorite ultra-portable radio for band-scanning <p> There 's another plus about the G6 . It feels good in your hand . I have big , clumsy fingers , yet I still manage to punch in the frequency correctly every time . Having the ( smooth ) tuning knob in the upper left corner of the radio where its accessible both on the side , and ( more importantly ) on the face , was a stroke of ergonomic genius by this little radios designer . I wish more manufacturers would do this . Its so easy and comfortable to band scan using your thumb on the face of the tuning wheel , which is great when you 're sitting around a campfire or listening to FM on a bumpy bus ride . <p> Do n't  get me wrong : if I were going on a DX vacation where I needed top-notch filtering , sync-detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the odd business trip , though , its the perfect little radio . <p> The G6 even has an external antenna connection . <p> Pros : <p> Small , affordable and full-featured <p> Shortwave and medium wave reception are comparable to others in price class <p> The Grundig G6 has been on the market a long time , in a consumer electronics life span . I would not wait to purchase one . Occasionally , RadioShack ( in the US and Canada ) will close out their stock of shortwave radios and the G6 can be found at bargain prices . Universal Radio currently has a promotion where if you buy a Grundig Satellit 750 for $299.95 , you will receive a free Grundig G6 . You get both a large portable/tabletop radio and a pocket-sized one in the same deal . That 's great value ! <p> I had this radio for 2 years before it broke down . Thomas is right . The airband on this radio is a serious disappointment , not because you expect it to be good , but because this radio is named AVIATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good . This is the one that should be named TRAVELER . Besides that , I 'd like to add some cons to this your review in order to explain the lukewarm ratings . <p> It is indeed a very small SW radio with continuous range from 150KHz to 30 MHz and usable SSB reception . This means that you can take it anywhere and listen to everything ! But it has various problems with its firmware that render the memory and alarm system completely useless . Then the MW has no sensitivity , the FM has no selectivity at all , and the AIRBAND plasters FM stations all over the spectrum and does n't  have a scan function . <p> It is a radio for a maximum of 50USD , like the Kaito KA 1103 or the Tecsun PL 660 . Not 100USD like it used to cost 3 years ago . It was a radio for 4 out of 5 stars . <p> And then all AM died . Meaning that my G6 now only has its so-so FM right now . I suspect that " poor static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the " con " section . I 'd give it now 3 out of 5 stars . <p> I have not owned either radio , but I know , from the numerous reviews I have read , that it really depends on the unit . For instance , a correctly produced Grundig G6 can easily outperform one of the worse G3 units , just as a well prduced G3 can equal the performance of a much much more expensive radio . As a very wise reviewer using the name " CATONI 52 " has said , in order to get the best unit , " ask the salesman to bring out three new G6s all in their boxes and put new batteries in themUsing this method , I 've never bought a bad radio that slipped past quality control . I 've done this with my Eton E5 , E100 , Katio KA1102 , KA11 and Grundig G6 . Compared three of each , and bought the best one of each . " <p> Very good review of this radio . As far as pocket radios go I know of none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroke of genius . No muting or excessive cuffing so you can have great fun band scanning . Especially good for those new to SW . Fine tuning on SSB is a challenge but with practice I have gotten very good at it . Just be ready to collapse the antenna if you get overloading . If only this radio had a Aux Line-in it would be my travel radio . I have a video on my YouTube channel snowpuppy77 comparing this radio to the Tecsun PL-606 . <p> Very good review , for a very good radio for its price . I got the Buzz Aldrin edition at Radio Shack on sale for $50 . The review is right about the SSB tuning . I set the SSB on and JOG slow , which allowed me to continiously tune the SSB signal . Apparently , as I tune up in frequency , the SSB tunes DOWN , until it reaches the next Khz , when it jumps to the next kHz up . Sort of backwards tuning . I am a ham and i bought the radio because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can copy many stations easily . I do not expect a CW filter at this price . In fact , just the cw filter will cost many times the price of this set . Yes , the manual is very confusing , but if the company would contact me , I would re-write it for them , for free . Why do n't  companies take advantage of their fan base ? <p> I had this radio . After I 'd had it almost a year , it started coming on , playing 87.5 FM at full blast . completely unresponsive to my control . I took the batteries out each time , them just left them out and shelved it . a few months later I plugged it to a wall charger and it operated normally for a week . Then it unceremoniously lit up the display like this : 88888.88 . Then died completely . <p> For the year before its odd demise , i regarded it as competent , nothing more . I could listen to Cuba with stability . If any shortwave portable cant at least do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio Australia in the morning- another simple feat for any shortwave portable . I never received anything that merited use of SSB . Air band was a non-feature . FM was ok , nothing spectacular . MW was fine , perhaps even a tad better than the PL-660 . <p> I liked the idea of a very portable shortwave that cost much less than a Sony SW-100 . It was cute . It said " Buzz Aldrin . " It was an impossible-to-resist impulse buy at Radio Shack on a trip out of town when I craved some radio enjoyment . If I had known in advance what it would be like to use it , I would not have wasted my money . <p> Now its 2015 and I own a Tecsun PL-310 . This radio is so much better than the G6 . Amazing how the shortwave landscape has changed so rapidly over two years even at this " late " ( maybe not after all ! ) stage in the game . <p> I am very happy to own G6 Aviator . I think it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also feel that with todays available technology , scope is vast . I wish if someone could use new technology and make some advanced radio sets , something like Sony ICF SW 100 of 1990s probably . Engineers can do wonders now . <p> I just received a grundig g6 , I have n't had a whole lot of success receiving a whole lot with the whip antenna . Can someone recommend an external antenna that works with this radio without it overloading , as I 've read is a common problem with this one ? <p> Bill , I 've been listening in the evenings on the lower bands , ive been able to pick up a handful of religious broadcasts , radio Havana and a Chinese station . Other than that not much with the whip antenna . <p> Well , that is usual for late evening in North America . First , get some bell wire ( coated copper wire ) of about 3 to 4 metres ( 10 12 feet ) and wind one end 15 turns around the thickest part of the whip . Maybe wind around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that coil and you can more easily put it on and off . Now rise the other end up-and-out . To a curtain rod , end of the house etc . That is about as good as it gets . Test with a weak station , then slip on the coil and off and see if the station sounds " better " The main thing is to try the right times and frequencies . They , the stations , do n't  broadcast 24 hours . It is inefficient to broadcast in the day when the ionosophere is high and the bounces are short , at night the ionosophere is lower and the skips are much longer in the range of 1000 km . Try to catch RNZI or Radio Australia in your listening time . These boom across the Pacific , and the bounces reach North America .

Some people drive up to a local mountain , turn off their car and listen there . There may even be space to ( safely ) lay out 2 kilometres of wire to create a strong directional antenna . <p> Best of luck . Signals are out there , but you might have to wake up early , stay-up-late to catch them .

The video is essentially a review of the Pioneer RT-707 reel-to-reel tape deck . The reviewer is using a " mystery " tape of shortwave radio broadcasts in the deck . 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 6 thoughts on " " Mystery " reel-to-reel tape of shortwave radio broadcasts " <p> I have always wondered why international broadcasters do not include something like This is VOA or This is Radio Romania along with their interval signal . It would make everyones job in identing stations a lot easier = I am sure there is a reason behind it ? also guessing that the interval signal can not go on too long before the station has to identify to keep in within licencing conditions ( 15 mins ? ) . <p> There was no need . The music used was also something connected with the country . <p> Intervals run as long as how long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ min to 30 seconds before . Others like Radio Netherlands depending on the service use to sometimes run it 3 to 4 mins before the start of the program at the bottom of the hour . <p> International broadcasters do have anything like the 15 minute mandatory ID.Which seems to be excessive . Most will say it at the beginning and ending of news . or at the end and beginning of a program . Sometimes even once an hour depending of the length . <p> Now on some of the early BBC World Service newscasts , which you can see here at certain times . They do it in the middle of the news . This is so stations that are relaying it can make that newscast shorter . ABC RN do with with Radio Australia . In Canada the CBC do it as well . Because some CBC stations depending on the time zone run either a longer or shorter version of the news . <p> As the YouTube comments indicate , there are transmissions from several clearly discernible shortwave and utility stations on this tape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into SW radio and has probable never heard an interval signal before . <p> Not only are Deutsche Welle and VOA ( Monrovia , Liberia ) on this tape , but also obscure gems like " This is a test transmission for circuit adjustment purposes " from Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. in Georgetown , Guyana . <p> Hope the guy still has the tape . He considers it strange and mysterious and thinks it has poor audio quality , but to me , that 's shortwave radio ! <p> I 'm the SWLing Post reader who tweeted Thomas about this video ! I just happened to come across it on YouTube while watching related videos and thought it would be interesting to share it in my Twitter feed , for him ( and my other followers ) to see ! <p> Ive been a keen general coverage LW-to-as high as I can ( = ) listener for a number of years now ( I would say 6 or 7 as of now , I do n't  know exactly time flies ! ) . During the last year or so , I 've also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me take the decision to improve the home stereo system I relocated a rather simple but effective Kenwood M-505USB mini-component system to another room ( and eBayed a pair of Realistic Minimus 7 speakers for it ) and replaced it with a Sony DHC-MD373 main unit , a Technics SL-DD20 turntable ( with a Behringer PP400 phono preamp ) , and a Pioneer CT-W505R cassette deck . I also use a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B as a digital audio and internet radio player ( with the RuneAudio OS and a HiFiBerry DAC+Pro digital-analog audio converter card ) , and an Apt-X enabled Bluetooth receiver so that I can stream audio from the computer or smartphone into the system . Future plans include adding a reel-to-reel deck . Open reel tape is ( still today ) considered to be one of the best audio quality sources and I would love to be able to have the capability to play it back ( and record on it ! ) . <p> Of course , as an SWLer , I could n't forget to add that RF flavor into the system ! There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one of the inputs in the back of the switching array that I use to select the audio source , and the component to send it to ( for recording and/or playback through the speakers ) . Whenever I find a good sounding SW station , I can plug that cable into the headphones connector of the 8500 ( I find it sounds better than the REC OUT line output , and its wired for two-channel mono operation , while the REC OUT is one-channel mono only and I have to use an adapter on it ) and simply enjoy the sound ! I find CRI Spanish to be one of the best stations for that . Their 20 KHz wide signals on 7210 KHz and 6020 KHz , TXd directly from China ( and from the Cerrik , Albania relay as well ) are booming here on an almost daily basis and , while they may be controversial for the amount of space they take on the band , I certainly can not deny that listening to a wide , booming signal from China containing recent pop hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stereo system , is an outstanding experience ! Plus , it has broadened my musical horizons as I 've discovered lots of cool sounding songs that I had n't  heard before = I also use a car FM stereo TX that I use for transmitting any audio originating from either the radio or the music gear into any device which happens to have an FM broadcast receiver in it , within the limits of my QTH ( I managed to extend the coverage of that TX by using a telescopic whip from a non-functional Tecsun PL-600 that I keep as a parts donor ) . For example , I can use the Panasonic RX-EX1 boombox that 's in the bedroom to listen to music from a vinyl record that may be playing on the turntable or to a SW station that may be tuned on my IC-R8500 = <p> The conjunction of both those interests has also led me to the discovery of C-QUAM AM stereo . Having listened to some samples of 10 Khz-wide signals from US AM/MW stations on YouTube ( and from SW pirate X-FM ) I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered lots of times if C-QUAM would be the solution for SW international broacasting stations to be popular amongst the general public again , over other ways to broadcast audio at an international level Not only can C-QUAM sound much better ( with the necessary bandwidth ) than digitally streamed audio , through RF , or even the internet , ( as its an analog signal and its not digitally encoded in lossy , compressed MP2 and MP3 codecs streamed at a low bitrate ) , but its more compatible as well . Any traditional mono AM receiver demodulates the signal just well , as it simply ignores the pilot tone and the L-R subcarrier . So there would be zero disruptions to the usage of existing SW RXs with the new C-QUAM signals It would be great to have the remaining SW broadcasters TXing in stereo I figure that , because they are fewer than in times past , it would n't be an unsolvable problem to make all the signals fit in the bands on a particular point in time even if the bandwidths used were larger ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could receive the above mentioned CRI signal in good quality C-QUAM stereo , all would be well for me ! <p> All in all , i 'm sorry for the long-winded , somehow off-topic comment ! I 'm more of a listener/watcher/reader ( in the internet as well ! ) as I know I can go on and on if I try to write a comment Like now But I hope Ive not been boring to anybody at least ! <p> What an interesting tape , brings back so many memories multiple receivers , multiple locations . I still own my first , a National NC-60 and a over the past few years a Icom R75 . I live in the NW burbs of Chicago and turning on the radio ( with a short single-wire antenna ) gets nothing but hash. i am not technical so the many cable boxes , power lines through the backyard and close neighbors keep the noise pollution high .

My love of shortwave radio listening eventually led me to obtain my ham radio license , and as a result , to learn about Morse code . I had always admired Morse codea.k.a . CW ( Continuous Wave ) as a mode of communication in the amateur radio world . <p> The Italian , hand-crafted Begali Simplex is this author 's way of sending code in style . ( Photo courtesy : Begali ) <p> Several years ago my passion for CW finally encouraged- me to learn it , during which time I practiced it almost daily with my ham radio mentors. - During the process of learning code , I went from struggling to hear the difference between " dits " and " dahs " to being able to distinguish letters , symbols , words and phrases. - Today , we chat over the SW radio bands about all sorts of thingsradios , the weather , our familiesin Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred language . " Indeed , it is sacredin its simplicity and its efficacy . Morse code is more- intelligible than voice-over long-distance radio transmission , because the receiver or radio operator only needs to- distinguish- between the short and long " dit " and " dah " sounds , truly form following function . <p> Do n't  be fooled by the NY Times articles title : the airwaves are always filled- with the sounds of Morse code 24/7 .

He commented with the following- brief review ( I inserted a few product photos from JayCar ) : <p> The AR1946 is now out . Had one for a day but ended returning it as shortwave was full of garbage . Fully DSP based according to the box . <p> I do have to say that FM performance is superb . Sensitivity and selectivity is better than any previous radio I have used and RDS is very usable even on weak signals . 10 kHz steps with a very smooth non muting dial make it a pure DX machine in my books for FM . <p> Digital DAB+ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AM modes have 7 bandwidths that work very well . MW is a bit dull but no images . <p> If only SW was good I would recommend it as a good all rounder but at $219 for just a great FM tuner I think its expensive . <p> Saying all this , the unit feels good quality wise and in my opinion is a better attempt than the Digitech AR1945 . <p> I think a revision can sort out SW and if so , I am definitely repurchasing . <p> Many thanks for your assessment , Avo ! <p> It sounds like your unit suffers from the same problems many recent DSP portables have experienced : a high noise floor . This was the issue affecting the recently released Degen DE1103 DSP. - I 'm not sure why this is happening more in some of the most recently released receivers , but I assume it has to do with poor engineering and internal shielding . <p> I bet that the- noise level may vary unit to unit . Avo , you might ask for another to test before getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Does the AR 1946 have SSB mode at all ? I bought the AR 1945 just as a " Novety " radio to play arround with , compared to all my other portables SSB is a waste of time even trying.Its a hit or miss when it comes to SSB with it.But I do n't  see it mentioned in the specs.If it has n't  got SSB at all , it is n't a full SW radio that 's how I see Sw radios.When picking a radio , it must have SSB for my likeing.Anyway it may be a big improvement for Digitech ! I may check Jaycar here in NZ ! ! <p> " Fully DSP based according to the box . " Interesting though on the JayCar website they write : " It utilises a PLL synthesized receiver for a high level of stability " <p> Also an interesting thing to note is the terminal block labeled " AM IF Out " it could potentially be used for feeding the IF to a DRM decoder . Do they specify the IF frequency anywhere in the documentation ? <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only been involved in Audio systems such as Speakers and Amps as far as I know.But the 1945 model does look simular to the Degan shape and design from what Ive seen on internet pics of it.It does n't  look as if the 1946 model has SSB.They have added features to it but have left out SSB.TheDRM decoder is of really no use to me , because I 'm right into SSB monitoring.Unfortunitly Digitech did not do a great job when designing the SSB mode on the 1945 yet it has very good sensitivity on all bands and really pulls in the VHF Air band far better than my PL660.Infact I find the Tecsun PL660 very quite on the air band.I have changed the tuning knob on my 1945 to give it a far better feel when turning , also added a large coaxal type socket at the rear of the case for my antenna imput.One thing about them , there is plenty of room inside to make changes.I also find its a great " Long distance " receive radio , would be great for the Out Backs of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 was a good radio for its price , so I 'm hopeing the 1946 is even better . <p> Hi all , I think you 'll find the Digitech Audio radios series are made by Redsun in China . You will see Redsun stenciled in the circuit boards if you open the radios up . I think Redsun is a step down on Tecsun in quality but trying to make inroads into the market . My guess is the board is similar to the AR-1945 and as such , wont have included SSB due to the atrocious design in the 1945 . They probably decided to leave it out . I agree , the shielding is a big problem in a lot of radios , just cost cutting and sadly ruins a lot of radios for serious devotees . You could make the shielding yourself and add it but it should n't be necessary . Stiil , I think I will have to get one at some stage ! Cheers . Phil <p> I suppose this receiver is ok for broadcast listening but paying A$200+ for the pleasure is a bit rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and varying audio quality as well . <p> I would also concur with the lack of SSB as a big omission . To me its a deal breaker and renders the receiver less capable than it could have been . I suppose Jaycar instructed Redsun to design a receiver that appeals to the majority of listeners rather than the enthusiasts that want to chase SSB DX . <p> Its rather demoralizing to see good quality SW radios with SSB capability drying up in the marketplace . I do n't  consider the SW receivers designed and manufactured in China anywhere near acceptable in quality and performance . If Sony had stayed in the market and Sangean not outsourced most of its manufacturing to China we might have a better choice of quality receivers . Instead we are bombarded with Chinese junk that wont stand the test of time . <p> There is no SSB capability with this unit . Interestingly the LCD panel ( which I suspect is the same as the Eton Field radio ) has icons for AIR , WB ( Weather ) , LSB , USB and SYNC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darndest times .. <p> I agree Phil and Keith that this is an amalgamated China production ala **28;301;TOOLONG . <p> Andi , the images above are of a pre-production unit . The production unit is all black and looks far better than these images portray ( Jaycar are doing a disservice to themselves , the production unit looks classy ) . The actual unit is as per the image on the packaging box . Labelling and general cabinet fit and finish are top notch . The buttons are solid to use and I keep harping on about the tuning knob , so smooth and linear . I might have had a decent unit with the quality though . If only SW was useable . The AM IF Out is not so on the production unit , it is an AM external antenna jack . FM/DAB connector is as shown . Sound quality is superb . No need to tweak the electronic bass/treble control . <p> John , could n't agree with you more . I salivated over units of yore in my youth and now that I have the means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago I bought a Sangean WFR28C internet radio thinking it would replace my Pure Sensia 200D . Returned it the next day . The cute little colour LCD panel was grossly askew ( slanted to the left quite prominently to the point that the bottom of the panel disappeared into the unit ) , constant clicks and pops on internet and terrestrial radio was plain deaf . <p> I do think though that this unit gives a glimpse into the direction of Chinese production . If the feel is anything to go by , I think some fun times are coming in receivers from China . Reminds me of car manufacturing . 4 years ago I bought a Kia Optima , a brand I would never have bought say 10 years ago . I am probably going to upgrade to the new for AU turbo model next year so impressed I have been with it . The quality is superb on my car and all reviews point to even higher quality in the new models . Korea has got its sh++ right with car engineering and design to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spend my hard earned money on equipment and engineering rather than brand plate . I think this is currently occurring with Chinese electronic manufacturing . <p> Oh yeah , one thing to keep in mind . FM being super sensitive might be problematic in high RF junk areas . My apartment is down in a gully about 11 kms from transmitter-ville in Sydney so the hot frontend was quite advantageous for me . Up until 5 years ago however I lived about 3 to 4 kms from the 4 major TV/FM tx towers vmany 50-150kW signals being transmitted from those towers ) . Now THAT location would have been a good test for this unit ! I strongly suspect overload will be an issue here .. <p> Hmmm , I wonder if the Soulra version of the Field is released yet Apart from design , I bet the 1946 is the same unit internally . As you say Keith , proudly brought to us by SOE . <p> I suspect the Eton/Soulra units and the 1946 are based around the same family of DSP chipset . If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the larger footprint of the Field . The engineering has already been done . <p> Eager to see more info on the new S8800 . I can certainly forgo digital capability if SSB is on the equation . Unfortunately no mention of RDS . The 1946 uses RDS ( or DAB ) to set the clock which is very useful ( if the station has the master clock set correctly ! ) for me Heres hoping the S8800 will have the necessary hardware for RDS . <p> Hi all , Ive now purchased the AR1946 and I have to say , I 'm very impressed ! No noise problems at all with mine , although if you listen very carefully under certain conditions , you can discern a slight digital hash . Not in anyway imposing though.This radio is super sensitive , AM comes very close to the CCRadio-EP in performance and FM is outstanding . SW is very impressive but there a a few quirks in tuning in as far as below 10MHz , you hit Frequency , key in the value and hit Frequency again to tune and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it jumps straight to the frequency . Not a great issue but worth knowing . This radio has 7 bandwidths in AM both accessible on MW and SW and rudimentary fine tuning with a separate wheel control . Unfortunately FM only has 1 bandwidth but seems well chosen . DAB+ is not available in Regional NSW so that can not be commented on . The telescopic antenna is ridiculously small but seems to pull in the signals with no problems . There are external antenna connections for improved performance . Audio is very pleasant and you can control both treble and bass with the push of a button . The display is bright , well lit and easy to read with a useful tuning indicator . There are a number of useful features and with 700 memories , there are more that needed . The radio is very reminiscent of the Grundig Satellit 700 in some respects . Build quality seems very good , time will tell if reliability becomes an issue . What I do n't  like is the radio partially mutes when tuning , this is annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed what appears to be synchronous detection being used as occasionally when tuning onto a frequency , you will hear the detector lock on frequency . If so , there is no control over this feature . That may explain the display showing synch but the final model has automatic synch lock .. The AR1946 dispenses with Airband that was good on the AR1945 and SSB . Its a pity that SSB is omitted but along with the Tecsun PL310ET with DSP , they do n't  have SSB capabilities as well . I suspect the same DSP chip is being used in this radio . Can I recommend the radio ? A resounding yes ! As mentioned I 'm very impressed . Try before you buy though as it may be that QC is variable along with many Chinese radios of late . <p> Hi all , I had a great opportunity to put the AR-1946 through its paces last night and I like this radio a lot . There are certainly some quirks with it , no radio is perfect by any stretch which , considering the amount of constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designers and manufacturers are bound by cost structures which would make the " perfect radio " cost prohibitive ! After all , the vast majority of users are the average person who has no interest in having a radio that can eke the last vestige of signal from the " ether " . It is only enthusiasts like us that wish for radios " Holy Grail " ! The AR-1946 is a radio that has to cater for both the average user and enthusiasts alike so as such some features that would make this radio as close to perfect as we would like just aernt there , but what features are available are very good . So a brief summary of the radio follows PROS : Super sensitivity on all bands ( DAB+ not tested ) Excellent selectivity specially on AM with no less that 7 bandwidths available Very pleasant audio Good build quality and well laid out panel . Good physical size of radio . Bright , easy to read LCD display ( see CON ) Soft mute that is a bane of many DSP sets is almost non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections Handy carry handle CONS Partially mutes on tuning with the rotary encoder . Makes band scanning for weak signals unnecessarily difficult . Rotary encoder too sensitive , increments in 1 khz jumps on AM , would be better to have radio tune in smaller increments , say 100 khz . Again makes tuning with the encoder difficult . Fine tuning control not really fine tuning ! Tunes in 1 khz jumps on AM , way too coarse . Obviously added with the thoughts of SSB but no SSB offered . No SSB as mentioned before . Some useful display icons not available . It would be good to have had the SW metre bands displayed when in the SW mode . As would have been a clock displayed when the radio is on . No Air band which is really a nice touch . No IF out for DRM listening . Some very slight digital and display noise but not imposing at all . So there you have it , as I said , no radio is perfect but the AR-1946 is never the less very good . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the partial muting when tuning . That IS a pain ! Can I recommend it ? As said before , a very definite yes but I must stress , make sure the seller will let you listen first as many Chinese radios lately have marginal QC and item to item variability seems to be a factor judging by Avos initial comments . I have none of the issues he s experienced . Cheers and good DX Phil <p> I forgot to add , it wouldve been good to have say 2 bandwidths on FM but so far the AR-1946 seems to be an FM powerhouse in performance ! Also the radio has line in and line out features . I 'm currently listening to ABC Western Victoria Horsham on 594 khz and I have to say the radio is slightly outperforming my CCRadio-EP here . Its 10am local DST and Horsham would be over 600 kms from my home QTH . Very impressive MW performance . Cheers and good DX .. Phil <p> I must say that my earlier version , the 1945 model certainly out performs all my other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , and the UHF Air Band is excellent , pulling all the local Air Traffic in very strongly.Unfortunitly the SSB mode on it is a joke , and I bought it for SSB DXing , but alass , I cant use it for that , so its become my radio that I take away when ever I go camping into the hills over here in New Zealand.It simply pulls in all our good old AM and FM stations no probs at all . So I now have it as my " Long distance " radio , I have made a few changes to it though , I 've changed the Tuning knob , giving it a much larger knob making it easier to turn and I have put a new antenna socket on the rear of the case enableing me to screw my antenna coaxal plug straight to it.But over all , I 'm very pleased with the radio , so I hope the newer version is as good or even better than mine . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207261 @3907261/ <h> A review of the Degen DE32 shortwave radio : compared with the DE321 and Tecsun PL-380 <p> The Degen DE32 is one of the latest DSP-based analog radios to hit the market . In the past , I have reviewed two others : the Degen DE321 and the Kchibo KK-9803 . Tecsun had announced a version of their ownthe Tecsun R-2010which I had eagerly anticipated , but I now believe its been dropped from their future offerings. - Update : Not truethe Tecsun has been released as the R-2010D , see review . <p> I purchased my Degen DE32 from this China-based seller- on- eBay . To my knowledge , - eBay- is the only place the DE32 can be purchased , at time of posting . As with the other radios mentioned above , my expectations were quite low for this little radio . - After all , at $27 US ( shipped ) , you cant expect top-notch performance characteristics . <p> The DE32 un-boxed ( Click to enlarge ) <p> The DE32 comes with a carry strap , USB cable , a carry pouch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not come with a USB wall adapter ( you 'll have to plug it into a USB port on your PC or other USB wall charger ) and it does not come with a Micro SD card ( for digital audio playback ) . <p> Audio <p> The DE32 has a small built-in speaker . The sound is a bit tinny , but is actually better than I expected from a speaker of this size . It makes for comfortable listening at close rangeespecially of spoken-word broadcasts . Happily , plugging in a good set of earphones helps audio fidelity tremendously . - This is the only way I would listen to music on the DE32 for an extended period of time . On FM , in fact , audio via earphones is surprisingly good ( again , for a $27 radiocheck out the audio sample below ) . <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Performance <p> The DE32 covers three radio bands : medium wave ( AM ) , FM and shortwave ( 5.6-22 MHz ) . Performance between bands varies greatly . The best band , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , as the DE321 and KK-9803 performed quite well on FM . <p> here 's a 20+ minute audio sample of a local classic rock radio station I recorded , 95.7FM The Ride : <p> From my home , I can pick up my benchmark distant NPR station quite easily if I hold the radio in my hand . If I place the radio in a window sill , its- performance degrades somewhat and contains more static as the extra grounding ( from holding the radio ) made a positive difference . The audio , though , is still perfectly intelligible . Local FM stations come in quite clear and fidelity ( through headphones ) is excellent . <p> The Degen DE321 ( left ) and DE32 ( right ) <p> I found that strong local medium wave ( AM ) stations sound quite good on the DE32better than its cousin , the DE321 , by a small margin . <p> While traveling over the holidays in December , I recorded extended samples of local station ( 630AM WAIZ ) with both the DE32 and the DE321 . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that I recorded these ( and the FM sample above ) with my Zoom H2N digital audio recorder , with radios at a comparable volume and via an audio patch cord . <p> Note that these recordings represent what each radio sounds like via headphones , not their internal speakers . <p> You 'll note that the DE32 sounds a little fuller than the DE321 , but reception is nearly identical on this local strong medium wave ( AM ) station . I also found that the DE32 was quite effective at nulling out local RFI ( electrical noises ) on medium wave . At the beginning of the recordings , above , you 'll hear the static increase and fade as I null out the noise by turning the body of the radio. - The DE321 could n't null out the local noise quite as effectively as the DE32 . <p> For medium wave DXing , though , you 're better off finding a different ultralight radio . The AGC simply ca n't handle marginal signals . Indeed , the same AGC problems plague the shortwave bands as well . DXing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with weak signals or fading . - All in all , as with medium wave , shortwave radio reception is fine for most strong signals . <p> Tecsun PL-380 : What a difference an extra $23 makes <p> On shortwave , I decided to also compare the DE32 ( $27 ) to the Tecsun PL-380 ( $50 ) . I tuned to a Radio Australia broadcast on 11,945 kHz . The comparison between these three portables is interesting : <p> Both the DE32 and DE321 struggled to receive the Radio Australia signal . In fact , if you really wanted to hear those broadcasts and had to listen on either radio for 30+- minutes- it would be frustrating and fatiguing . Notice , however , the difference when listening to the same broadcast with the Tecsun PL-380 : <p> The Tecsun PL-380 receives circles around the DE32 and DE321 on shortwave and medium wave ( Click to enlarge ) <p> There 's no comparison , really . In other words , you can hear it . The PL-380 has a lower noise floor , a fuller sound and no AGC problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always take the PL-380 while travellingand as a back-up if I plan to record a broadcast on-the-go . <p> On the shortwaves , as with medium wave , the DE32 is respectable when tuned to a strong signal . For comparison to the weaker signals above , here is a short recording of the DE32 tuned to Radio Havana Cuba : <p> Not too bad , really . Keep in mind , though , that in my part of North America , Radio Havana broadcasts are so strong that I can pick them up without even extending the whip antenna on most portables . <h> Conclusion : <p> The DE32 has a built-in LED flashlight ( Click to enlarge ) <p> I have n't tested the digital audio playback on the DE32 yet , although I expect the audio to be pleasant enough . - Of course , it lacks a display to show any information about the audio you 're playing , but it would be great to load a few podcasts or audio books on . <p> In summary , I 've tabulated the pros and cons below from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Note that these pros and cons take into account the $27 price level of this radio : <p> Pros : <p> Very portable and lightweight <p> With micro SD card , storage for hours of pre-recorded content ( though not tested in this review ) <p> Conclusion ? Though slim , lightweight and inexpensive , I would n't find the DE32 DSP radio/digital audio player a useful radio in my collection . <p> If I were you , would I buy it ? <p> If you 're looking for a very inexpensive MP3/Digital Audio player with AM/FM and shortwave , and your expectations are fairly low , the Degen DE32 is a reasonable $27 piece of kit . Especially if you only plan to use the FM band . <p> If the digital audio playback abilities are not important to you , I would go with the cheaper ( $18 US ) Degen DE321 . <p> But if you really want performance on medium wave and shortwave , and you could care less about digital audio playback , spend the extra $23 ( $50 total ) and buy the Tecsun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a much , much better receiver . <h> 11 thoughts on " A review of the Degen DE32 shortwave radio : compared with the DE321 and Tecsun PL-380 " <p> Thanks a lot for enabling readers to listen and compare the three radios sensitivity on a weak station the best test there is , I think .

This satellite feed is the way Radio Australia gets to the network of FM Transmitters they have scatted around the Pacific Region ( which is why they feel they do n't  need shortwave anymore for most populated areas of Radio Australias target area now is covered by a network of Radio Australia FM transmitters ) . <p> Some differences to the first file Radio Australia is produced in FM quality stereo , though of course DXers only ever heard it in shortwave quality mono . So this network feed is in stereo and has a wider dynamic range that what DXers are familiar with from Radio Australia .

I will plan to collect these and put them on the Shortwave Archive in the near future . <p> Go Nick . Should the need for financial support for Nicks campaign arise , perhaps a GoFundMe account can be set up ? I 'd willingly throw some money his way for the opportunity to hear Radio Australia on shortwave again . My wife thinks Im nuts when I described to her the emptiness that I felt this morning without my daily dose of RA on 9580 Khz .

I did the same this morning . Turned my receiver to 9580 and listened to static . = <p> Its a shame what 's happened to the shortwave medium in the last 15 years . So many stations that were mainstays such as Radio Canada International , Radio Japan , KBS Seoul , Voice of Russia , most of the BBC World Service , to name a few , have been eliminated in the name of budget cuts and technological advances . With digital media subject to content filters and other methods of control , the continuing value of shortwave can not be understated . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener for about 40 years . I was fortunate to have been old enough to appreciate and experience the glory days of the medium which were the late-70s through the advent of the internet . As a youngster I believe that I developed a unique sensitivity to global concerns due to my exposure to stations like Radio Australia . The value of other sources of news beyond those available in the United States can not be understated . <p> I hope that Nick is successful in forcing the ABC to re-think the issue . <p> Yep , tuned in early this morning to their domestic service on 4835 and nothing but static ? . On a positive note though there was good DX and I picked up Solomon Islands BC on 5020 for the first time in years . <p> Maybe something can be done like when Deutsche Welle in Europe vacated 6070kHz in 2013 . A band of German radio amateurs applied for and were allocated 6070kHz and now have an operational 10kW/25kW station called Channel292 ( http : //www.channel292.de ) , using the driver stages from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although they pretty much operate the transmitter at 15 euros an hour airtime that I imagine would cover power costs . If some radio amateurs could get together with some crowdfunding to get a transmitter on the air , I would certainly throw some AUS dollars their way . Alternatively someone could rent airtime on other transmitters ? would not need to be 24/7 , just a few hours a day , would need to be fixed hours so folk know when to tune in . Suspect running your own smallish transmitter would be more cost effective in the longer term , like how they are doing it in Germany on Channel 292 . The link below is well out of date and they operate more than just weekends , check out the schedule on the Channel292 website . When they are on air you can tune in here : LONG ... <p> Found 2 static filled spots in the memories of my tranceiver/receivers as of Tuesday , My Brisbane built Sneider tapped whip on the truck has a 4835khz tap that is no longer useful ! <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . <p> I can only hope that the transmitters and antennas are mothballed and preserved rather than being dismantled . A good HF signal may one day soon be required when some clandestine hacker downs the digital/satellite networks . Luckily I awoke to live Kookaburras sounding off this morning however I miss the sound of them and " Waltzing Matilda on the airwaves . In my travels the R Australia signet tune and Kookas was so recognisable when looking for a bit of home from far away . One can only trust that actions by some of the less Canberra and metro centric aware politicians can put the govt on notice and encourage funding to reinstate the service . PS the govt has approved a $237 , 000,00 rebuild of the Australian Embassy in Washington DC ! the good will generated by RAustralias pacific service at a a cost of $1.500,000 is uncalculable. 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207267 @3907267/ <h> Tag Archives : Tecsun PL-880 List of hidden features <p> I have never seen such a eager response and extraordinary anticipation over the announcement of a new portable radio as with the new Tecsun PL-880 . And I 'm not surprised. - You see , it has been a couple years since a really good portable radio has been introduced to the market . Plus , Tecsun has proven itself a competent radio manufacturer ; the predecessors to the PL-880i.e. , the PL-660 and PL-600are both excellent portables ( I own both ) . Their smaller DSP radios are favorites of travelers and ultralight enthusiasts . <p> As I was telling Jeff , over at the Herculodge blog , reviewing the PL-880 was much like attending the opening night of a play . My wife , who has worked in theatre , once told me , " the audience wants the actors to perform well . " The moment I held the PL-880 in my hands , I felt the same : I really wanted this to be a great performer , a new radio companion with which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what does the PL-880 actually deliver ? Let 's take a look <h> Drumroll , please.and now , the PL-880 <p> I purchased/pre-ordered my Tecsun PL-880 from my favorite eBay seller , Anon-Co , as I 've always been pleased with their customer service and delivery time . They 're based in Hong Kong , but my shipping time from Hong Kong via FedEx was only three days before the radio landed in my mailbox . <p> Unlike past reviews , in which I simply post initial impressions with a full review later , I elected to spill some of my early findings on the SWLing Post as I discovered them . - On the recommendation of a reader , I even photographed the unboxing ; I 'm glad I did , too , as it felt a bit like taking pictures of a Christmas gift being openedwhich was even merrier . <p> I was happy to see that the PL-880 was packed carefully but with very little waste . Included with the radio was a rechargeable battery , earbud headphones , a wire antenna , and a USB power cable ; Anon-Co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying case , which holds the PL-880 and its manual , is substantial , reminding me of carrying cases that used to ship with portables some time ago . <p> The PL-880 is almost identical in size to the PL-660 and PL-600. - The buttons have a highly tactile response , the tuning/volume wheels are very smooth , and feel well-engineered . The display is back-lit and has a dedicated switch on the right side of the radiomeaning that if you turn on the back-lighting , it will stay on , even if you turn off the radio . <p> The PL-880 has all of the connections and controls I could have wished for in a portable . On the left side of the radio , it has an external antenna jack , a three-position antenna gain switch ( DX , Norm , Local ) , a headphone jack , a line-out jack , and a 5 VDC USB input . - On the right side panel , you 'll find the - main tuning knob , fine-tuning knob , the volume , the back-light switch , and a tone control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio , there is also a " snooze " button . <p> When I turned on the PL-880 for the first time and ( ironically ) tuned to a local AM station on 880 kHz , I was most impressed by the audio fidelity of the 880s built-in speaker . I believe the PL-880 uses a speaker system similar to the Melson portables : a small mylar speaker cone with some sort of acoustic chamber that produces great bass tones and treble highlights . The sound is room-fillingand delightful . <h> Performance : First impressions <p> To begin with , please note that my impressions of performance band-by-band , below , is based on a little over one week of listening . I typically spend longer with radios before publishing a review , but with the holiday season fast approaching , readers have asked for a more rapid response . That being said , I will of course update and adapt this review over time ; but be assured that any significant updates will be noted as such . <p> Filters <p> First of all , what truly sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market is its selection of bandwidth filters . On AM , for example , the listener can choose between the following bandwidth settings : <p> 9.0 kHz <p> 5.0 kHz <p> 3.5 kHz <p> and 2.3 kHz <p> In SSB mode , the choices include : <p> 4.0- kHz <p> 3.0- kHz <p> 2.3- kHz <p> 1.2- kHz <p> 0.5- kHz <p> Choosing a bandwidth couldnt be easier : simply press the " AM BW " button to display the current bandwidth setting , then either use either tuning control to widen or narrow the filter , or press the " AM BW " button to cycle through the options . <p> But how well do these filters work ? - Very well , in my opinion . Indeed , I think this is the most innovative and valuable feature of the PL-880 . The filter selection gives the PL-880 some of the best selectivity for a receiver under $200 US . To test selectivity , I usually tune to a part of the shortwave broadcast spectrum with two adjacent signals , and see how well the receiver blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took it up a notch and tuned to the CW ( morse code ) portion of a ham band , as CW signals are spaced much closer together than broadcast signals , thus are more challenging for a receiver to select between . I was delighted to note that the PL-880 not only passed this rigorous test , but performed well above my expectations . <p> In the video below ( which I posted earlier ) , you can hear what the PL-880 sounds like tuning through a CW pileup . While I would expect more from my ham radio transceiver , I 'm most impressed with how well the PL-880 handles these tight conditions . Listen for yourself : <p> To be clear , though , the bandwidth functionality is not without its quirks . I have yet to determine why it happens , but occasionally when I narrow the bandwidth to , say , 1.2 kHz , then begin tuningespecially when tuning quicklyit opens up to 3.0 or 2.3 kHz . Additionally , with the narrower filters does come a slight audio splatter if a signal peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume setting , and may actually be associated with the PL-880s fast AGC circuit . I have found that the radios three-position attenuation switch is a friend in these conditions , often eliminating the splatter when attenuation is increased . <p> But , all in all , when it comes to selectivity , the PL-880 is truly a winner . <h> Hidden features <p> The new PL-880 ships with a number of hidden features that are , curiously enough , not documented in the operation manual nor indicated on the radio labeling ( at least in this first production run of radios ) . Many of these secret features require that you press and hold a button for about three seconds to enable it . <p> I 'm not sure why Tecsun decided to hide these features . I 'll admit that Ive really enjoyed hunting for and discovering themmost are terrific additions . - On the other hand , it has been frustrating as well : - I came close to posting an article describing what seemed to be an unfortunate audio stability problem in the PL-880 , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the signal level either fell below or climbed above 5 , the audio gain would increase or decrease dramatically , making listening very fatiguing . A reader then discovered the hidden " muting threshold " feature , and the story changed . I found that my radio had shipped with a default threshold of " 5 " I was able to turn off muting , changing the threshold to zero , and this instantly fixed the problem . <p> Rather than explaining each hidden feature here , I have added an appendix at the bottom of this review that lists undocumented featuresat least those I 've discovered so far . I plan to list others as Iand/or Post readersdiscover them . <h> Band performance <p> FM <p> One of the first FM stations I tuned to was my benchmark NPR station ( WFAE ) on 90.7 FM , located about 92 miles away from my tuning locale . WFAE is line-of-site from my altitude , but serves as a benchmark nonetheless : my inexpensive receivers cant maintain a lock on it . - Through the PL-880 , the broadcast sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality receiver such as thisbut it passed my FM benchmark . - Indeed , I could n't even hear a hint of static on the PL-880 . I then tuned to several other FM stations I use as benchmarks , and the PL-880 could detect all of them comfortably . <p> Though I have n't tried FM DXing with the PL-880 , like other recent Tecsuns , it seems outstanding in this regard . ( Herein lies the extent of my FM testMore to come . ) <p> AM/Medium Wave <p> Ill be the first to admit that I cant claim to be an AM/medium wave DXer , although recently I have been spending much more time on the band . <p> With that disclaimer out of the way , I find that the PL-880 certainly holds its own on the AM broadcast band ( 570-1600 kHz ) . - The PL-880 can hear every local and relatively distant AM station that my C.Crane CCRadio-SW could hear . For this type of armchair listening , the PL-880s speaker delivers fidelity that is nearly unmatched amongst portables of similar size . Its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : though this video was shot informally with an iPhone , you can still hear the difference in fidelity between the Tecsun PL-880 and the PL-660 : <p> Nighttime listening on AM is on par with the PL-660 in many respects , but I believe I prefer the PL-660 for this , as it features slightly- better nulling and more intelligible audio . During nighttime conditions , upon tuning in a wobbly , fickle AM band , the PL-880 sounds a little more muffled or " mushy " than the PL-660 . Also , the PL-880s audio can splatter a bit when the filter is narrowed ( again , sometimes moving the attenuation from " DX " to " Normal " helps with this . ) <p> Also , I have to point out that the PL-880s AGC ( auto gain ) circuit , as with many other Tecsun models , is just too fast for optimal weak-signal DX on medium wave or shortwave . Tecsun , if you 're listening , please slow it down a bit , or at least provide an AGC controlThanks ! <p> Update : Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong AM ( MW ) stations are hearing multiple images from those stations across the MW band , making it difficult for medium wave DXing . <p> But now , on to my favorite part of the spectrum <h> Shortwave performance <p> Of course , I 've spent the bulk of my PL-880 listening time on the shortwaveswhere I find the PL-880 a pleasure to operate . <p> Tuning <p> The PL-880 sports both broad tuning and fine tuning controls on the right side of the radio . They 're perfectly positioned to be operated with ease by the users thumb . They also protrude enough from the right side of the radio so that it can be tuned much like the tuning knob of the PL-660from the top side of the control . <p> The keypad on the front of the PL-880 has a quality response/feel . Selecting a frequency is as easy as entering the number in kHz . No other button pushes are needed , much like the PL-660 , and the Grundig G3 . By pressing the " SW METER BAND " up/down controls , you can move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you change the mode to SSB and use the same up/down arrows , the PL-880 will cycle through the amateur radio bands as well . - Nice touch , Tecsun ! <p> Tuning increments are in very fine 10 Hz increments with absolutely no muting between frequenciesBrilliant . <p> The hidden sync lock feature <p> There was much speculation prior to the PL-800s introduction as to whether it would have a built-in synchronous detector . After all , its predecessor , the PL-660 , has a great sync lock that helps with selective fading and adjacent signal interference. - I was very happy- to discover- that by pressing- and holding- the USB/LSB buttons , the user can activate an undocumented sync lock feature which is selectable on upper and lower side-bands . <p> After using the sync lock on a variety of strong/weak signals , I find that I 'm not exactly wooed by it , however. - The PL-880s sync detector is just not as good as the PL-660snot by a long shot . On weak stations , the PL-880 lock is feeble and wobbly . On strong stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A sub-par sync lock is not a deal-killer for me , though . - Why ? Because I get excellent results by simply using an SSB mode ( USB/LSB ) and zero-beating the AM carrier . Its a trick well known in the SWLing world under many namesI call it ECR ( exalted carrier reception ) click here for a previous article on the topic . This method rivals the PL-660s sync lock under similar conditions . And as a bonus , the PL-880 bandwidths can be widened to 4 kHz , allowing near-AM fidelity in SSB . <p> How does the PL-880 compare with the PL-660 , SW7600GR ? - <p> A few days ago , I spent some time comparing the shortwave sensitivity and selectivity of the Tecsun PL-880 , PL-660 , and the Sony ICF-SW7600GR . Instead of shooting a video on my iPhone ( which lacks a good mic ) , I used my newly-replaced Zoom H2N digital recorder with a direct , line-in connection . <p> I did my best to match the volume levels in the radios for a fair competition. - Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a major plus , in my opinion ) , the PL-880s line-out audio level is set way too high and overloaded the Zoom recorder ; the FM line level can be adjusted , however . <p> AM Sensitivity <p> The first test was in AM , and I chose Radio Exterior de- Espa+a on 9,605 kHz , which was moderately weak compared to other broadcasters on the 31 meter band . I recorded one minute clips . Halfway through the PL-660 and ICF-SW7600GR clips , I turned on the sync detector . On the PL-880 , I simply turned on SSB , as I did not feel that its sync detector added to intelligibility . <p> Click on the radio name to download the MP3 of each clip , or simply listen via the embedded players below : <p> I then tuned all of the radios to 18,135 kHz , where ZD8UW ( The- Cambridge University Wireless Society ) Ascension Island- DXpedition- was handling a pile-up. - You wo n't hear stations calling ZD8UW , because they were working split and listening on 18,141 kHz . There is an adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . <p> In this test , I had all the radios set to a narrow bandwidth . I had the PL-880 set to 3 kHz as it sounded similar to the others at that width . Since propagation conditions were changing , - I made two recordings of one minutes duration of each radio . - I picked the version of the recording in which each radio experienced the same signal strength . Again , - you can click on the radio name to download the MP3 of each clip , or simply listen via the embedded players below : <p> The PL-880 is certainly sensitive on the shortwave bands , but when listening via headphones ( as in this example ) , there 's sometimes a bit of splatter when the audio peaks . The PL-880 demonstrates great selectivity , as promised . - In the SSB example above , the PL-880s 3 kHz filter successfully rejected the adjacent signal much more cleanly than the narrow filter on the PL-660 could . <p> PL-660 vs . PL-880 : Which is the better radio ? <p> In my tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own against the PL-880 , and is certainly the best bargain of the two at $100-$120 US . In general , I find the PL-660 to have an edge on the PL-880 in terms of sensitivity . While I prefer the audio characteristics of the PL-880s internal speaker compared to that of the PL-660 , vocals seem to pop out of the noise better with the PL-660 . <p> But comparing these two radios in terms of sensitivity is problematic , as its not an " apples-to-apples " comparison . In the examples above , I tried to keep the playing field level by leaving the PL-880 on one bandwidth setting and not using the hidden DNR feature ( which seems to alter the bandwidth and lower the noise floor ) . Its certainly possible some users may be able to tweak the PL-880 to give it an edge on the PL-660 in similar conditions . <p> Whether or not you should buy the PL-660 or the more expensive PL-880 will clearly depend upon your listening goals . If its to pull out voices from the static , for station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . If you want armchair listening of shortwave broadcasts with very low listening fatigue , go ahead and splurge for the PL-880 . If you want a simple , straightforward portable , the PL-660 is your best option . If you like to tinker with settings , and enjoy all a radios bells and whistlesincluding tracking down hidden ones ! the PL-880 is your radio . <p> If your goal is to listen to SSB broadcasts ( pirate radio , utility stations , ham radio traffic , so forth ) both radios will do a fine job , but the PL-880 is more versatile and , again , has better selectivity . <p> Frankly , I will keep both radios in my listening arsenal . Which will I turn to the most ? While I love the PL-660 , I 'm a sucker for the more dynamic , rich audio of the PL-880 . To me , any difference in sensitivity is negligible . <h> Summary <p> Every radio has its pros and cons , of course . When I begin a review of a radio , I take notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my initial impressions . Following is the list I formed over the time I 've been evaluating the Tecsun PL-880 : <p> Pros <p> Excellent ergonomics <p> most functions are either available at the press of buttonor by pressing and holding a button for three seconds <p> tuning options include a dedicated fine-tuning control <p> buttons have a sturdy , tactile feel and response <p> Excellent sensitivity and selectivity <p> Wide array of filter options in both AM/SSBmore than on any sub-$200 portable on the market <p> Absolutely no muting between frequencies , even while using a .5 kHz filter in SSB <p> Using SSB ECR is more effective than synchronous detector ( see con ) <p> Sturdy carrying case has dedicated pocket for English operation manual <p> Single supplied rechargeable battery delivers very long life ( see con ) <p> Supplied rechargeable battery is not as common as AA batteries ( see pro ) <p> Supplied battery charger is a bit noisy on medium wave and shortwave if listening while charging . ( Not a problem for me , as I 'm a batteries-only listener . ) <p> All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirky little rig that boasts more features than any other portable Ive ever used ( save the Eton E1 ) . Its sensitive , selective , has silky-smooth tuning and robust audiobut its not perfect . Many of the cons listed above could be fixed with firmware updatesones which I hope users can make at home as opposed to needing to buy a newly-updated radio . <p> And , Tecsun , I hope you add those hidden features to future operation manuals . Were keeping track of them here , and on the Yahoo PL-880 group , but some recipients may never realize the muting threshold , for example , can be adjusted . Tecsun , if you feel like these features are n't  ready for production , simply label them as beta or experimental features , and go for it anyway . <p> With all of its features and functions , hidden or not , I 've found the PL-880 to be a challenging , but thoroughly enjoyable , portable to evaluate . Indeed , I 'm still not done yet : - I plan to take my new PL-880 traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's more to come ! <p> IMPORTANT- UPDATE Dec 14 , 2013 : Many units purchased at Amazon.com ( via Kaito Electronics ) have an older firmware version and users report problems and lack of features/functionality . Many have even returned their radios for a refund . At this point , I would exercise caution when making a purchase ; you might even wait until Tecsun has either removed the older firmware units from the market or given its users a way to make updates from home . - If you want to purchase a PL-880 soon , I can only recommend buying from the same company I did , Anon-Cosee info below . I would verify with them that your unit has the latest firmware . <h> Where to buy the PL-880 <p> The PL-880 is only available from a few retailers thus farmost of whom are on eBay , some on Amazon . I purchase all Tecsun products from Anon-CoIm sure there are other qualified sellers on eBay , but Anon-Co- has always provided me with excellent and responsive customer service , so I can recommend the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three days . Kaito Electronics , a US-based distributor , also sells the PL-880 on Amazon.com . The price on the PL-880 has been fluctuating over time , but seems to hover between $150-$180 US : 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

As of Tuesday , at least 5,000 people were dead and at least 10,000 were injured . Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless . <p> With any natural disaster , communication can often become a matter of life and death , and if phone lines are broken and cell towers crumble , relaying messages to the outside world and coordinating rescue efforts becomes that much more difficult .

After the quake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer ham radio operators from India traveled to the region to relay messages from areas whose communications infrastructure is broken or overloaded .

At its peak , in the 1970s , the two main fighting movements , ZIPRA and ZANLA , established exiled radio stations in neighbouring countries where their fighters received training . These stations broadcast into Zimbabwe via short and medium-wave . It was the way to communicate with the local villagers who supported the war by sharing intelligence and foodstuffs . <p> But in a bid to thwart enemy operations , Ian Smith , the last white Rhodesian ruler , developed strategies that forced radios to be fitted with frequency modulation ( FM ) , as opposed to short wave . <p> Manufactured by local Zimbabwean firms , Smith 's FM radio sets were branded with the name Chief ' .

A frequent and arguably fair focus of criticism has been the Broadcasting Board of Governors , the body created to supervise government-funded media outlets while serving as a firewall between them and the political administration of the day . <p> A radical change to that system is now coming " and it looks like one that Vladi-mir Putin and Qatar 's emir might well admire .

It was a guarantee that for decades has helped to attract journalistic talent to the broadcasting organizations , as well as listeners seeking reliable information . The board of governors had serious problems : Its members served part time , and not all took their duties seriously . But the system 's biggest flaw was remedied three years ago with the creation of a chief executive position . <p> The new reform , driven by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R.

Here , we have the " peoples " chamber transferring more of the peoples power to the executive branch again . Remember the War Powers Act , trade authority , etc ? I 'm sure the executive branch will love having its personal propaganda unit with little oversight from the US Congress . There 's only one solution to this madness .

Sad to say , VOA and R. Liberty will become just like the dumbed-down and slanted national media you see coming out of NYC ( TV &amp; NYTimes ) and D.C.

Many , many people are disenfranchised by only hearing from one media source ( with only one point-of-view ) all controlled through one large city ( nationally and regionally ) .

Recent availability of an SD Card image makes for easy set up on a Raspberry Pi . <p> Ive been fascinated with radio astronomy since my university days . In the 1980s and 90s almost any radio astronomy experiment equated to forking out some serious money to purchase a wideband receiver ( serious money to a student , at least ) . With the advent of SDRs , though , radio astronomy has become affordable for everyone . <p> Over on YouTube user- MaskitolSAE- has uploaded a video showing him receiving some noise bursts from Jupiter with his SDRplay RSP1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via natural radio lasers ' powered partly by the planets interaction with the electrically conductive gases emitted by Io , one of the the planets- moons .

According to the YouTube description , it appears that he is using the UTR-2 radio telescope- which is a large Ukrainian radio telescope installation that consists of an array of 2040 dipoles . A professional radio telescope installation is not required to receive the Jupiter bursts ( a backyard dipole tuned to 20 MHz will work ) , but the professional radio telescope does get some really nice strong bursts as seen in the video . <p> As Carl mentions above , you do not need a professional radio telescope to receive Jupiter noise bursts , a dipole will do . <p> In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated Jupiter receivera simple SDR kit called the Radio JOVE Receiver which is promoted by NASA .

So , my apologies for displaying the mess in public , but in response to having been asked many times by subscribers to Oxford Shortwave Log- to share my shack , here it is , well most of it at least , in all its unadulterated glory . <p> - <p> The primary- reason however for this post is to share my most recent transatlantic medium wave catches using the brilliant Elad FDM DUO and Wellbrook ALA1530 magnetic loop antenna . This excellent combination continues to pull in really nice DX , although not so much very recently as propagation has been fairly rubbish . However , since early to mid December , the dynamic duo have managed to pull in a number of transatlantic medium wave signals , including Radio Rebelde , Cuba on ( 670 and 710 kHz ) , KVNS Texas , CHIN Radio , Toronto , WFED Washington DC , WWNN Health and Wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from WMEX Boston and WWKB Buffalo , New York . Embedded reception videos and text links follow below and in the mean time , I wish you all great DX ! 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Hi Thomas , thanks . The FDM DUO as a standalone receiver is at least as sensitive as my Sony ICF-200D psuedo table top ( I say that because its large ) and both Yaesu FRGs , but with a far lower noise-floor . It hears the same stuff , but the SNR is nearly always superior . As regards selectivity , the FDM DUO in standalone mode superior to all of them and operating via the FDM SW2 software is hugely more selective with the myriad of filtering and signal conditioning options available . The reason I bought the Elad in the first place was simply because I wanted a full SDR receiver that could also be used in the traditional sense and only the Elad fully offered this functionality at the time . As regards other SDRs , I have the NooElec RTL-SDR with Ham-it-up upconverter . Its quite sensitive with a longwire or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-power South American broadcast stations . However , its nowhere near as sensitive as the Elad and the audio fidelity is pretty horrendous on my Macbook Pro , with clipping issues that , for whatever reason , ca n't be effectively adjusted out . I guess I would recommend an RTL-SDR when starting out , but for serious DXing , you need something with a little more under the hood so-to-speak . Its my understanding that ultimately , the Perseus marginally out-performs the Elad , but at a higher purchase price . If regarded as a function of performance over cost , the Elad must be hard to beat and I would always strongly recommend it . <p> Thanks for your insight , Clint ! Spec-wise , the DUO also looks very good on paper . The ARRL gave it a very favorable review last year as well . I have the FDM-S2 and believe its an amazing little SDR . Elad now makes an outboard filter box for the FDM-S2 which essentially brings it up to the performance of the FDM-DUO ( receiver-wise ) .

While his site is in German , which we do n't  read or speak here , Google Translate gives us English speakers a fair idea of his findings , and Fernando helps us with the rest . <p> To summarize , his comparison of the Bonito 1102S RadioJet with his Microtelecom Perseus concludes that the two perform well , running about neck-and-neckin other words , offer almost identical performance characteristics . - There were some differences , though . I outline a few key review points that Fernando was kind enough to clarify for us : <p> The noise floor between the Perseus and RadioJet is more or less the same , in his tests . <p> He finds that the Perseus is slightly more sensitive on higher frequencies ( above 22Mhz ) . - This comparison is made with the " DX Channel " on the Bonito 1102S RadioJet ( a feature only found on the Radiojetsee note below ) . <p> Fernando believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar . He told us that he could not hear a great difference . <p> The Perseus software is , of course , very stable and mature in comparison with that of the new Radiojet . This is quite typical of new SDR products on the market , as it takes time and user feedback to eliminate bugs and quirks . Fernando expresses his confidence , however , that the software engineers at RadioJet will be quick to respond to patches and upgrades . <p> Overall , he believes that RadioJet will be able to provide a very stable product in short order . <p> Since Fernando has been a beta tester for the Bonito 1102S RadioJet , he s familiar with the company and their attentiveness to feedback , and he s impressed . <p> One feature unique to the RadioJet- is the " DX Channel . " You can see this in action in a- video- the company released last year : - in essence , when activated on a weak signal , the noise floor drops , and the signal seems to pop out of the static. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that , when the DX Channel is activated , the software lowers the IP3+ and increases the sensitivity . This is the default channel or mode on the software . <p> The normal " RX Channel " is used for strong signals and is better for in-band interference . The DX Channel has a higher IP3+ . He mentioned that the software can automatically determine which channel should be used , and auto-switches it for the user . Fernando said that this function works quite well . <p> Like to hear the difference for yourself ? - Fernandos website Fenu-Radio.ch has a page dedicated to audio comparisons between the Perseus and RadioJet . The first 15 seconds of each audio clip feature the Perseus , the second 15 seconds features the RadioJet. - Click here to go to the audio page . <p> By the wayFernandos website is most impressive . He has a long list of receiver reviews , comparisons and audio files . I encourage you to spend some time there , whether or not you read German . <p> I 'm wondering if the " DX Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preamplifier on other receivers . Typically , IP3 goes down and sensitivity goes up with the preamp in-line . Or is this a different method to accomplish the same thing ? <p> It seems that if the DX Channel in RadioJet provides equal performance to Perseus , then is there any value ? Maybe " DX Channel " should be enabled by default ( no need to elevate it to the status of a " feature " ) but offer the user an attenuator function for those times IP3/front end performance needs help at the expense of sensitivity . <p> One think I would like to point out according to the specs on RadioJet the maximum bandwidth you can see in the SDR software is 48khz , while most other SDR radios sample a few hundred khz of the RF spectrum . <p> The radio jet reminds me of a Ten Tec-RX-320 modified with hmode mixers and a build in usb soundcard , and a nice software interface . But they do state that their radio is an IF receiver not a full sdr , once you get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen 48khz seems bad . <p> Even the home built softrock ensemble receiver can receive 96khz of the spectrum at once , I think while that this is a good idea I would rather spend a little more and get a real SDR radio where the RF is sampled at the antenna . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207283 @3907283/ <h> Phils review of the Digitech AR1946 <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post reader , Phil Ireland , who shares his review of the Digitech AR1946 : <p> I 've now purchased the AR1946 and I have to say , I 'm very impressed ! No noise problems at all with mine , although if you listen very carefully under certain conditions , you can discern a slight digital hash . Not in anyway imposing though . <p> This radio is super sensitive , AM comes very close to the CCRadio-EP in performance and FM is outstanding . SW is very impressive but there are a few quirks in tuning : <p> below 10MHz , you hit the Frequency button , key in the value and hit the Frequency button again to tune to the desired station <p> above 10MHz , you hit the Frequency button , type in the value and it jumps straight to the frequency without pressing the Frequency button again . <p> Not a great issue but worth knowing . <p> This radio has 7 bandwidths in AM both accessible on MW and SW and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FM only has 1 bandwidth but seems well chosen . DAB+ is not available in Regional NSW so that can not be commented on . <p> The telescopic antenna is ridiculously small but seems to pull in the signals with no problems . There are external antenna connections for improved performance.Audio is very pleasant and you can control both treble and bass with the push of a button . The display is bright , well lit and easy to read with a useful tuning indicator.There are a number of useful features and with 700 memories , there are more that needed . The radio is very reminiscent of the Grundig Satellit 700 in some respects . Build quality seems very good , time will tell if reliability becomes an issue . <p> What I do n't like is the radio partially mutes when tuning , this is annoying when bandscanning with the rotary tuning control . I have noticed what appears to be synchronous detection being used as occasionally when tuning onto a frequency , you will hear the detector lock on frequency . If so , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing synch but the final model has automatic synch lock .. <p> The AR1946 dispenses with Airband that was good on the AR1945 and SSB . Its a pity that SSB is omitted but along with the Tecsun PL310ET with DSP , they do n't have SSB capabilities as well . I suspect the same DSP chip is being used in this radio . <p> Can I recommend the radio ? A resounding yes ! As mentioned I 'm very impressed . Try before you buy , though , as it may be that QC is variable along with many Chinese radios of late . <p> It seems , like with many other DSP portables ( including the Sangean ATS-405 ) internally-generated noise may vary from unit to unit . I 'm guessing this could have to do with slight variations in the board assembly ( variations in soldering , grounding , shielding connections ) . <p> As Phil advises , please check your radio immediately after purchase and compare it to another shortwave portable if you have one available . This way , if you detect a noisy receiver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of the return policy . <p> The unit is SiLabs based . The SiLabs chips are fully digital receiver ICs wchich are connected to a HF input circuit and deliver the demodulated audio . The chips are parametred by a microcrontroller via I-C bus . There are no IF stages , neither filters . DAB demodulation could be provided by another chip . <p> Hmmm . I think I will go to another Jaycar store and get another unit based on your assessment Phil . <p> I think this unit has one of the new integrated Silicon Labs DAB chips ( ? ? Si468x ) which includes all listed bands . This wont be the same as in the 310ET as that unit does not have DAB or RDS capability . I do think however that it is the same as the Eton Field/Satellit models as Soulra ( Eton Europe ) has their models advertised with DAB capability . <p> As per Richards reply , the leading zero does the trick for &lt; 10MHz frequencies on SW . <p> As for the partial muting when tuning on AM bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sync detector in the DSP chip , simply a slow and prominent AGC . Once it has ramped up , there is no notable soft muting on AM bands . There is slight soft muting on FM however , but only maybe 3db . <p> Hi Avo , Thanks for the comments , I wonder if there is a way to adjust the AGC so as to speed it up a bit , it is definitely too slow . Having that chip would explain the lack of SSB as well . Again , I enjoyed listening to the radio and was amazed at its performance with such a short aerial . I think attaching a short external antenna will boost it considerably further . I did connect it to an external FM antenna and was easily able to get RDS from the outlets in Orange about 60 kms away . Next time I 'm in Sydney , I will bring the radio and test the DAB capabilities of it . I did a brief comparison between the AR-1946 , the Sangean ATS-803A and the Grundig Satellit 2400SL Professional with the Grundig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the most instances , the 1946 outperformed the Sangean except on a couple of frequencies on the 49 m Band . I will add the summary of the radio I made on Avos page for interest here . PROS : Super sensitivity on all bands ( DAB+ not tested ) Excellent selectivity specially on AM with no less that 7 bandwidths available Very pleasant audio Good build quality and well laid out panel . Good physical size of radio . Bright , easy to read LCD display ( see CON ) Soft mute that is a bane of many DSP sets is almost non evident Multiple tuning features ( See CON ) External antenna connections Handy carry handle CONS Partially mutes on tuning with the rotary encoder . Makes band scanning for weak signals unnecessarily difficult . Rotary encoder too sensitive , increments in 1 khz jumps on AM , would be better to have radio tune in smaller increments , say 100 khz . Again makes tuning with the encoder difficult . Fine tuning control not really fine tuning ! Tunes in 1 khz jumps on AM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSB but no SSB offered . No SSB as mentioned before . Some useful display icons not available . It would be good to have had the SW metre bands displayed when in the SW mode . As would have been a clock displayed when the radio is on . No Air band which is really a nice touch . No IF out for DRM listening . Some very slight digital and display noise but not imposing at all . So there you have it , as I said , no radio is perfect but the AR-1946 is never the less very good . It 's a keeper for me with the only real issue for me the partial muting when tuning . That IS a pain ! I hope any purchasers of the radio also get good examples to avoid disappointment . With a good 1946 , listeners should enjoy a great radio . Cheers and good DX .. Phil <p> I forgot to add , no doubt readers wouldve noticed that I was optimistic in the number of memories ! Its actually 480 with a further 20 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AR-1945 was a nice touch and it wouldve been good to have it in the 1946 as well . Typo there ! I will try the leading zero when tuning SW . You have to add a trailing zero when tuning FM as well but in MW , it is direct . Cheers .. Phil <p> Phil , Thanks for your post on the Digitech AR-1945 radio . I bought one two weeks ago and find the " Manual " very basic , and confusing ! Do you know how to store a stations frequency into a memory position , and sometime later on , retrieve it to listen again ? I just cant fathom it out ! Any help will be very welcome . <p> Hi Lorri , To tell you the truth , I have n't ventured into the memory layout of the radio , I rarely use any memory features of any radio , preferring to either direct enter a frequency or use the tuning knob so I cant really help you there . I noticed the manual is very sparse so hopefully it can be worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 or 1946 you have ? If its the 1945 , how do you find the SSB ? Cheers . Phil <p> Hi all , I had the opportunity to assess the capabilities of DAB+ on the 1946 while visiting my son in Sydney near Narellan . Location would be about 50 kms south west from the transmitters and I was surprised at just how good the DAB+ capabilities were on the radio . Audio was excellent and I was able to receive most DAB outlets with only the occasional dropout . Moving the radio closer to a window solved that issue and DAB reception was then rock solid . It was easy to toggle between the scrolling text and I 'd and the information shown on the display was adequate for general purposes . A big plus here ! I also checked out the FM-RDS capabilities and was happy with the radios performance here . The Sydney outlets were at full signal strength and the RDS performed faultlessly . Another big tick . One thing I did omit from my previous assessment is that there is no option to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band so there may be a chance to overload on external antennas . Having some form of control would be handy . Ive been using this radio a lot and must say I 've been pleasantly surprised by its performance . from my perspective , its been a good buy .

@@75207285 @3907285/ <h> A review of the Degen DE1129 portable shortwave radio <p> The Degen DE1129 is the latest compact , full-featured , DSP-based , AM/FM shortwave radio from Chinese manufacturer , Degen. - Its available from TecsunRadio.com- at $100 US , shipped. - I received my sample radio last week , and published my initial impressionsof the unit . Since then , I 've had time to put this tiny radio through its paces and learn the functions of the various buttons labeled in Chinese , which I do n't  read . In the following review , well study the positive characteristicsand the drawbacksof this little radio . <p> Getting started : - the unit <p> I 'll begin by discussing some of the positive attributes of this radio . First , it should be noted that the DE1129 I have reviewed is one of the first to be produced , and as such , it currently has 18 buttons screen-printed in Chinese . Last week , Degen announced that they will be producing an English version , and ( importantly ) adding a number pad for keying in frequencies directly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers retailer . It will require- squeezing- a lot of buttons into a very small area , but I imagine this alteration will be easy enough , and probably remain functional even for those with larger fingers . <p> Degen has confirmed that they intend to produce a DE1129 with a number pad and English print in the future ( Click to enlarge , Photo : Degen ) <p> On the topic of buttons , those on the DE1129 are easy to push and have a very tactile responsevery much like those on the Tecsun PL-380 and PL-390 . I do n't  expect these buttons are likely to be compressed accidentally if the radio is in your pocket , but just in case , there is a number lock button ( with a key icon ) that will further protect the radio . <p> The body of the radio is made of a hard , smooth plasticwithout a rubberized coatingand seems durable enough . The speaker is not exactly flush-mounted . Instead , it protrudes from the rest of the body by about 1/4 - inch . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure this was in order to- accommodate- a larger speaker than it otherwise would have had . <p> The audio from the built-in speaker is impressivein fact , this is possibly the best feature of this little radio . - Just the other day , I was able to listen to an NPR FM station , with the volume turned up , as I cooked a meal ; typically , I would n't be able to hear a radio this small while doing other thingsthe output would be tinny with too much emphasis on the treble end of the audio , and the sound lost in all but a quiet room . However , the DE1129 speaker offers just enough bass to keep the audio ( especially on FM , or from a quality digital audio file ) comparatively rich and full . In essence , it sounds like a larger radio . Though the speaker lacks a bit of mid-range , the overall experience of listening to AM is quite pleasant , while FM is exceptional . <h> Digital Audio Player/Recorder <p> The " Music " mode will allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest DSP radios , Degen has added digital audio recording and playback features . - The DE1129 is no exception , and offers the following capabilities : <p> Records from a built-in microphone <p> Records directly from the radio while playing <p> Plays any MP3 formatted audio files <p> Offers many standard music playback options , like repeat , shuffle , etc . <p> Provides expandable memory via the insertion of a micro SD card into the radio , has 4GB of storage built-in <p> Perhaps the handiest feature is the fact that you can connect the Degen DE1129 to a PC , via supplied ( standard ) USB to miniUSB , for file transfer and maintenance . In my case , no additional software was needed for recognition of the DE1129 by my Windows 7 PC , which simply interpreted the radio as a storage device . <p> The " Voice " mode must be used to playback any recordings you make with the DE1129 <p> NOTE : The DE1129 divides recordings into two different categories : " Music " or " Voice . " - " Music " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root directory of the radio ( when viewed on your PC ) . " Voice , " on the other hand , is stored in the " Voice " folder on the radio and is accessible only via the radios " Voice " mode . I could not find a way , for example , to record music on the FM radio and save it in the " Music " categoryI believe anything that is recorded on the radio itself will be filed under " Voice . " Of course , you can connect the radio to your PC , then manually drag the files from the " Voice " folder into the root directory to have access within the " Music " mode . If you actually used the built-in microphone to make a live recording , it will also be saved under " Voice . " <p> My DE1129 came with two preloaded MP3sa Kenny G song and a Chinese pop song . I added a few of my own choices and , again , was favorably impressed with audio fidelity from its tiny speaker . <p> Recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First of all , a note of caution : I know that some of the DE1129s- predecessors had - quality issues , when users tried recording from the radio without setting the volume to a very precise level. - - I assume that 's the reason why , when you record from the radio , the DE1129 auto-adjusts the volume level to a rather specific setting . Therefore , while the radio is recording , you can not adjust the volume . This would n't be a problem , save the fact that the volume level it sets is rather loud . The first time I tried recording from the radio , I was using in-ear , noise-cancelling headphones ; the radio rapidly shot the volume level up to such a level that I had to jerk the phones out of my ears to protect them . In many situations , I find the volume level via the built-in speaker a little loud , as well . You will not be able to- discreetly- record your favorite show during church or while eating dinner with the in-laws ! During recording , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oddly , while recording , the DE1129 will allow you to engage the mute functionit even shows you the audio muted iconbut it has no effect on the audio level , whatsoever . <p> The " Record " mode is only used to record via the tiny built-in microphonequality is quite good for voice <p> There are two levels of quality when recording : 129K or 96Kbps . Regardless of the setting , I find that there is a loss of quality when recording via the built-in recorder , though perhaps slightly less than with previous Degen models . When I recorded a stong FM station at 129K , I notice at least a 20% degradation in audio quality . The recorded audio sounds slightly muffled and garbled , more like an MP3 recording made at 48 Kbps . There was a- noticeable- lack of the higher and lower tones which make the DE1129s internal speaker otherwise sound quite- crisp . <p> There is a less noticable difference in audio quality while recording AM radio ( whether shortwave or medium wave/AM ) . No doubt , this is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower audio characteristics and general fidelity of FM radio . - While AM recording quality is acceptable and content is intelligible , for playing back a recorded program , it certainly leaves a lot of room for improvement . As with FM recordings , AM recording sounds muffled . <p> I would not recommend purchasing the Degen DE1129 if you 're seeking an all-in-one unit to record quality radio on-the-go . If you can settle for a mediocre recording , and you do n't  mind the fact that while you 're recording , the radio will be playing at fairly high volume , then this may be a useful feature . <h> Radio performance <p> The " FM Radio " mode is actually the mode for all radio bands , including shortwave and medium wave <p> While I spent the bulk of my time testing the DE1129 on the shortwave and AM/MW bands , I will cover all three bands in order of performance , starting with the best . <p> FM <p> The Degen DE1129 is an excellent FM radio . In my tests , it received both strong and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eton S350DL , which I routinely use for receiving weaker FM stations in my area . Again , FM sounds great via the DE1129s built-in speaker , providing nearly room-filling sound from a very tiny package . <p> The DE1129 ( lower right ) , with its competitors , the Grundig G3 ( top ) and Tecsun PL-380 ( lower left ) <p> Shortwave <p> I always spend the bulk of my radio review time on the shortwave bands , of course , and to test the DE1129 , I pitted it against my trusty Tecsun PL-380 and Grundig G3 . Note , however , that neither the G3 nor the PL-380 have recording capabilities . <p> Sensitivity <p> First , the good news . Shortwave sensitivity , in general , is fairly good on the Degen DE1129 . With it , I was able to hear most of the weaker stations that were received by the PL-380 and G3 . I believe adding a length of wire to the antenna with an- alligator- clipas there is no external antenna jackcould slightly improve performance . I may test this further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the telescopic antenna can not rotate , attaching a wire to the antenna will be less than practical , as this will tip the radio over . <p> But unfortunately , the DE1129 suffers from several shortcomings that make it the clear loser against its two- similarly-priced competitors . Note that I mentioned- a few of these problems in my- initial impressions- post. - Here is more detail , by function : <p> This image , with English translations for the keys on my DE1129 , helped me identify each buttons function . Since there are n't  many buttons , I found that only after a few minutes of using the radio , I no longer needed to reference it . Click to enlarge <p> AGC ( Automatic Gain Control ) <p> The pre-defined AGC level is simply inadequate for comfortable shortwave radio listening of weaker signals . As mentioned above , though the radio has the sensitivity to detect the weak signals that its competitors can readily detect , the AGC gets in the way of comfortable listening . It creates a sort of pumping effect on weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing : " at times , the radios- signal will pop into clarity , then back into obscurityobviously , it does not handle fading very well . The G3 , in contrast , even without the sync detector engaged , did a much better job . <p> Bandwidth <p> The bandwidth is fixednon-adjustableon the DE1129 . It is adequate for general shortwave broadcast listening , but a little too wide when you have two strong stations crowded together . Several times , adjacent broadcasts would bleed into the broadcast I was monitoring . I would expect even some rudimentary bandwidth control on a radio in the $100 US price category ; the G3 ( at $99 ) has wide/narrow , and the PL-380 ( at $60 US ) actually can be adjusted in 1 kHz increments from 6 kHz down to 1 kHz . <p> Single-Side Band <p> The DE1129 does NOT have SSB , thus would be useless for monitoring ham radio traffic , or listening to pirate radio stations in SSB , for example . The- similarly-priced Grundig G3 does , of course , have SSB . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frequency steps <p> Unfortunately , the DE1129 has fixed frequency steps at 5 kHz ; you can not adjust it to be more or less . - In comparison , both the PL-380 and G3 can be adjusted down to 1 kHz steps . <p> Since the DE1129 mutes between frequency changes , it creates a " chuffing " sound while band scanning or tuning much like the PL-380 . The Grundig G3 , in contrast , tunes with smooth , continuous soundmuch like an analog radio . <p> Tuning Speed <p> I normally do n't  bother commenting on tuning speed , but I find that band scanning on the DE1129 leaves something to be desired . Its rather arduous . <p> The DE1129s hard plastic band covering the tuning wheel may protect it if dropped , but its also in the way of your thumb for easy tuning on the side <p> The tuning speed is not adaptive . Meaning , if I turn the tuning dial faster , it does n't  increase the speed of tuning . This is very frustrating , especially since the model I reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I want to move from 5800 kHz to 6100 kHz , it takes a lot of tuning to get me there ! <p> If I were stuck with the DE1129 as my only shortwave radio , I would be forced to fill its memory bank with all of my favorite frequencies , just to make tuning easier . <p> The DE1129 does have two different ways to navigate the shortwave spectrum : <p> By pressing the " Shortwave " button repeatedly , the DE1129 will move you from one SW meter band to the next highest . This is the only practical way of tuning . <p> The other way , ( practical only if you want to listen to something outside of the normal broadcast meter bands ) is to manually tune the entire SW spectrum ( 2.3 23 MHz ) in 5kHz increments . Since the tuning rate is rather slow , this is a cumbersome process to say the least . To make it go a little faster , you could allocate memory locations , say at 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 MHz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could tune . <p> Noise <p> My observation is that the radios internal processor and/or display seem to inject noise into the DE1129 . This is especially- noticeable- on medium wave ( see below ) . <p> While testing the radio against the G3 and PL-380 , I even noticed that I could hear the ( tuning ) encoder noise of the DE1129 , emanating from it , and even from other radios operating within two feet of it . Each tuning increment ( via the tuning wheel ) would produce a clicking sound in the audio of not only the DE1129 , but even more noticably in that of other radios . The DE1129 is obviously generating a little RF noise of its own . <p> SW Summary <p> At $100 US , the DE1129 is simply not a good value for those interested in shortwave radio performance . Perhaps if it were in the $40-50 category , my expectations would be lower , and it might meet them at this price point . At the very least , a wide/narrow bandwidth control and the ability to speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and functional radio . - The sloppy AGC alone , though , would still keep me from recommending the DE1129 as a good shortwave radio . <p> AM/Medium Wave <p> On the positive side , the DE1129 can be used in any ITU region as the user can specify either 9kHz or 10 kHz spacing , although there is no option for- choosing- frequency steps less than 9 kHz . <p> How well does the DE1129 perform on medium wave ? Not so well , I 'm afraidits mediocre at best . Medium wave suffers from many of the same problems as shortwave ( described above ) , including the fact that the DE1129s AGC ( Auto Gain Control ) simply can not handle the up-and-down nature of weak AM stations . <p> Ticks like a clock ? <p> Perhaps worst of all , though , is a " ticking " sound that plagues this Degens audio on the medium wave band . Spaced almost at second intervals , this " ticking " sound is present most anytime I listened to an AM broadcast . It was less- noticeable- in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recording- a broadcast only seemed to make it more- noticeable . <p> Unfortunately , if you purchase the DE1129 to listen to medium wave , you are likely to be- disappointed . <p> The DE1129s thin rechargeable pack fits neatly into the battery compartment on the back of the unit <p> Battery <p> As mentioned in my initial impressions , the DE1129 operates on a slim 3.7V 850 mAh Li Ion battery pack . Unlike most other shortwave portables on the market ( but similar to the Grundig G2 and Degen DE1128 ) , it does not operate on AA batteries . <p> No doubt , the slender battery pack allows for the compact form factor of the DE1129 . In my testing , I found that the battery life is very good . Indeed , I have not needed to re-charge the battery even though I 've played the radio for many hours in testing. - I can not speak to the overall longevity of the battery pack , however . <p> While I 'm sure these battery packs are convenient , I still prefer the traditional AA battery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to order a replacement , whereas most portable radios only require the- ubiquitous AA cell . <h> Stacking up the pros and cons <p> The rechargeable battery pack is very slim <p> Every radio has positive and negative attributes , and the DE1129 is no exception . Alas , in this caseespecially since I 'm reviewing this with a focus on shortwave and radio performancethe negatives outnumber the positives . <p> Pros : <p> Audio from built in speaker is superb for size ( see con ) <p> Sturdy , smooth plastic body ( see con ) <p> Perfect small size for travel <p> Strong FM radio performance <p> Ability to record either via built-in microphone or directly from radio ( see cons ) <p> One-button recording from any radio band <p> Crisp , easy to read backlit display <p> MP3 playback and functionality <p> Simple interface via supplied USB cable to both charge the radio and add/maintain recordings and MP3s <p> Tuning rate is fixed on SW at 5 kHz and not adaptive if you turn the dial faster <p> 4 or 5 second delay when turning radio on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , band and starting/ending a recording <p> Protective tuning knob strap prevents thumb tuning <p> While recording from radio , the volume level will spike loudly and can not be changed or muted regardless if using built-in speaker or headphones <p> Recorded radio audio suffers from compression and is significantly degraded from the original broadcastless- noticeable- on SW and MW/AM <p> No external antenna jack <p> No English manual ( at time of this review , though I imagine this will be forthcoming ) <p> In the current firmware version , the radio mode is displayed as " FM Radio " in the menu selection , though this mode covers all radio bands <p> There are no backlight options or modes that I could findif you touch a control or move the frequency , the display will remain backlit for only about 10 seconds ( please comment if you know how to change this ) <h> Summary <p> I really should have started this review with the following disclaimer : it is possible that there is functionality to this radio , and adjustments that can be made to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , I have toured and tried every menu option and explored every possibility with the radios settings . - However , since this is an early production unit and all of the instructions are in Chinese , I could easily have missed something . Future firmware updates and the forthcoming numeric keypad could also change my opinion of the DE1129 . <p> With that said , I can freely comment on my experience : <p> If you are looking for a very compact radio with good FM reception , with MP3 recording and playback , with a compact form factor and a wonderful built-in speaker , you may want to consider the Degen DE1129 in your search . <p> If you are seeking a good shortwave or mediumwave radio , however , I would look elsewhere . <p> Overall , I feel like the DE1129 has much room for improvement , and I hope Degen is listening and will make firmware upgrades to quickly address some of my criticisms above . Its as if - the DE1129 was built around the MP3/FM functionality and shortwave/mediumwave was simply an add-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE1129 for shortwave DXing , and certainly not for mediumwave DXing . The fact that the radio receives noise from its CPUespecially the ticking sound on MWmakes me believe that it was not thoroughly tested before production . <p> The Degen DE1129 &amp; box ( Click to enlarge ) <p> For the price point ( currently $100 US , shipped from the manufacturer ) , I simply expect better performance . In my tests , the Grundig G3 and Tecsun PL-380 outperformed the DE1129 in every respect on shortwave and mediumwave . <p> TecsunRadio.com provided a sample unit for this review and I paid for DHL shipping . - I can say that Ive been very pleased with customer service at TecsunRadio.com . Since they are in a different time zone , and English is their second language , communication was slow , but they answered my many questions . <p> Dear Thomas , thanks for this great review . I am really looking for good MP3 recorder , but the fact that this radio has to be set to high volume level while recording is a real killer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this is fixed I will have to stay away from it . As an alternative , I am looking into SANGEAN PR D8 , not sure whether you ever had a chance to review this radio . <p> Thanks for the kind comments , Ante . Yes , the fixed volume level in record is more than annoying . I feel like this should be something that can be fixed , else its simply a hardware limitation . I have not tried the Sangean PR D8nice looking radio , though . Amazon reviews are somewhat mixed . Have you considered the CC Witness Plus ? Cheers , Thomas <p> Very good review . You saved me some disappointment . I am wanting a tiny radio that has a Aux Line-in . Kind of like the Grundig G3 and the Tecsun 390 has . I have the Tecsun 390 and love the radio though I sure wish it had SSB . Disappointing to see lack of SSB in these DSP radios . If my Tecsun 606 had keypad entry , little better SW sensitivity , Aux Line-in , and SSB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grundig G6 is a excellent pocket radio for me but if only it had the Aux Line in and played just a little louder without distortion then it would be my travel radio . There 's no perfect radio . My current travel radio is the Tecsun 390 due to the Aux Line in and the ETM which is great to start when you arrive at the hotel room . It displaced my Grundig G5 as the travel radio . <p> Thanks for the kind comments . You 're rightI do n't  think the radio you 're looking for exists yet . My fear , in truth , is that there will be a move away from SSB on many shortwave portables . Other than the G6 and the DE1102 , its very hard to find an ultra compact radio with SSB . <p> Unfortunately , nothing has changed in this respect . There is no way to defeat the high volume level while recording nor a way ( that Ive found ) to increase actual recording quality . My review and side notes were sent to Degen engineering . I hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it worth to connect the earphones or adjustable speakers ? In this case internal speaker will be silent . Sorry , if somebody already adviced this I did n't  trace all messages . <p> NOT HAPPY I bought this Degen DE1129 and there is a continual ticking in the AM radio the reception is very week is something wrong with this radio , when I press the ESC button the ticking noise stops and a few minutes later the radio turns off . When I adjust the volume button I can hear the interference in the speaker as the segments go up or down . I did purchase a DE1123 and undoubtedly this pocket radio is the worst radio I have ever baught . I use AM and record programs at times but it is impossible to record anything on AM . Now I ca n't record anything on AM for the ticking noise in the DE1129 , is this what I should expect from DEGEN , PLEASE LET ME KNOW . <p> Yes indeedI foung the clicking to be a real annoyance as well . In my unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that Degen engineers begin developing a nice , innovative design , but the moment they realize a profit can be cut , they stop . This unit , in my opinion is not finished . They need to finish engineering and testing it . <p> Hello Thomas I have read your report , thank you , but I have a new problem I think I may have stuffed it up the DE1129 wont read English any more so can you tell me how to program so it reads English Please . <p> Hello Thomas do you have the answers for me I have tried every way to get this radio to change back to English . The operation manual does n't  help I tried to download the firmware upgrade and got nothing what should I do , someone please help . <p> Apologies , but I 'm afraid I ca n't be of much help . I was hoping someone else would chime in . I sold my DE1129 several weeks ago .

Your detailed evaluations of ULR devices are wonderful and have been invaluable in helping me determine which to buy or not to buy . It does seem like there may be one pocket radio that does meet most ( if not all ) expectations of most users . The Sony ICF-SW07 is exceedingly available from both Amazon and Ebay ( which is confusing since the radio was supposed to have been discontinued from production nearly a decade ago ) . I realize the price is absolutely horrendous , .. but I am wondering what your opinion is about its FM/MW/SW/SSB capabilities . The radio has both Synchronous Detection and a Variable Attenuation . Thanks so much , Mark . <p> Thanks for your comment . The ICF-SW07 is an excellent travel portable . I 've never owned one , but I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique radio . Yes , unfortunately , the price is incredibly high ( $600-$900 on eBay ) since this is a fairly sought-after unit . It would be very difficult , though , for me to splurge on it as for that same price I could get a capable late-model portable ( like the PL-660/PL-880 ) and a tabletop like the CommRadio CR-1 . <p> Admittedly , the size factor is a major plus of the SW07 , Still , if I purchased one for $700 , I 'd be afraid to travel with it ! = <p> I 'm amazed , too , that they 're still being sold . I imagine they 're still on the market in Japanjust not in North America/EU . <p> I am thinking about getting this radio to review on my YouTube channel becuase I noticed that they have a 1129a for sale on Amazon for about $60 . Do you know if any of the problems you mentioned have been corrected in the " a " revision ? <p> Good question , Tom . I was so turned off by the 5 kHz tuning steps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to see your review of it ( and post it here ) . If I were you , I 'm not sure I 'd even fork out $60 for the 1129a . I would be more interested in other radios out there . <p> As I ve already a Degen radio model 1121 that s very good for me considering that I like listen to broadcasting national radio in SW like Radio Australia , China Radio Intl. , NHK Radio Japan , KBS Korea etc and the MP3 recorder is very good to send directly MP3 recording directly to the stations , I 'll want to know if there are some differents with new model 1129 . <p> As I ' ve already a Degen radio model 1121 that s very good for me considering that I like listen to broadcasting national radio in SW like Radio Australia , China Radio Intl. , NHK Radio Japan , KBS Korea etc and the MP3 recorder is very good to send directly MP3 recording directly to the stations , I 'll want to know if there are some differents with new model 1129 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebay from a seller in US .

The review mentions the gadget is easily recognized by Windows 7 PC . Can anyone guide me ? <p> You might try plugging the 1129 into a different USB port . On my Win 7 PC , I simply plugged it in and Windows found and automatically installed the appropriate driver ( most likely , a standard USB driver ) . If this does n't  work , try restarting your PC , then plugging the 1129 in again . Hopefully , this will initiate the search for the driver .

@@75207286 @3907286/ <p> Does that also mean that one could record the entire SW band at one sitting , too ? 87 to 107 MHz , or perhaps 0.5 to 20.5 MHz ? Wouldnt that truly be something amazing . Of course , I cant really think why I 'd want to do that , besides something really cool to do ! Perhaps studying the noise floor ? Antenna work or comparisons . Anyway , fun to dream ! Presumably one would need one fast computer ! My Dell already has trouble sometimes with Perseus recording just 1.6 MHz of spectrum . <p> That was my first thought too . One could easily record most of the shortwave spectrum in one sitting with such huge bandwidth , but I suppose that would already be kind of in the overkill territory . The reason I say this is that I recently studied the behaviour of the shortwave bands across time LONG ... and it seems that its almost never the case that all of them are active at the same time . 12 MHz would probably be enough . Also , at Elads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk space for a one hour recording . <p> Agreed . I think in terms of research , recording the whole HF spectrum would be fascinating . But as you mention , I typically do n't  need to record more than one or two meter bands simultaneously during band openings . If the FDM-S3 would have the ability to break apart the bandwidth into two separate and independent receivers ( I 've no clue if this would be the case ) , it would be fascinating to make simultaneous spectrum recordings . The Titan SDR does thisindeed , at least the Pro version will record up to four 325 kHz +/- ( cant remember exact bandwidth ) spectrum recordings simultaneously . <p> Hi Walt , I know you often DX both MW and SW when you are visiting your place in Haida Gwaii . When propagation is good throughout MW upwards , this would be a fine way to capture all the action to DX with the WAVs later . <p> I notice that CPU usage during the screen capture shown was 20% for the FDM-SW2 software running the S3 hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throughput of the USB 3.0 connection , all the way from the SDR , to the controller chip(s) , the data bus on the motherboard , and to the solid state drive . The actual CPU speed would be secondary . <p> There is a tradeoff between the bandwidth and the quality of the signal . The properties/preselector you need for MW is very different what what you need for 28 mhz . Getting them together in one shot is good but also has its processing challenges for the SDR . In fact when using an SDR rule of thumb should the narrrowest bandwidth that you need such as one ham radio band at a time or one broadcast band at a time . You can see why manufacturers of the higher grade SDRs like flexradio and anan have not played the bandwidth game . That is not to say that custom made SDRs for government orders do not receive/record/archive the entire hf spectrum for later data mining . As speech recognition and other tools become more advanced these saved spectrum recordings can be archived , researched and analyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century newspapers . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

Now , I 'm sure many of you know from your own experiences that DXing from a noisy hotel room can be just about impossible and so it was in the main . I did however manage to copy a very nice signal from BBC Radio 5 Live on 693 kHz medium wave and Cha+ne 3 , from Tipaza , Algeria on 252 kHz the latter is a much more difficult catch back in the UK . Reception videos for these two signals also follow below and I have to say that given the very noisy environment , this was a pleasing result using the Etons internal ferrite antenna .

@@75207292 @3907292/ <h> Rons mini review of the Sangean DT-160 AM/FM radio <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , Ron , who shares his impressions of the new Sangean DT-160 : <p> The DT-160 just came in and here are a few impressions : <p> 1 . ) The heft and feel of this set is superbit has that solid- feel the earlier DT-200X doesnt. - It is markedly smaller , too and the buttons have- a firm solid- feel the earlier models lack ( finally ! ) . <p> 2. ) - Jays review is spot-on as usualbut the AM section is- not what you find in a Sony SRF-59 or SRF-37W digital. - Expect to get locals and semi-locals fine but its not going- to be a DX machine on AM as the Sonys are . <p> This is doubtless due to the need for a smaller ferrite bar ; - a Q-Stick or loop will fix that . <p> 3 . ) On the other hand as Jay said it leaves the Sonys in the- dust on FM , which is superb . <h> 10 thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I 'd be curious how this unit stacks up in actual use to Sangeans DT-120 and DT-180 , to which it looks similar . I have a DT-120 , and am generally very pleased with it , although the battery life is relatively short . The 120 and 180 do have the advantage over the 160 of smaller size and lighter weight , and on paper at least they appear to be louder than the 160 . <p> It would be useful to see a performance comparison of the Sangean DT-160 to the vintage Sony SRF-39FP , a legendary prison radio . Both share prison marketing demographics and design . Given the limited internet access available to incarcerated AM-FM listeners perhaps a test run simulating the effect of prison walls on AM-FM radio reception would be particularly informative . A good prison radio would be a dynamite radio for those outside the bars . <p> At least here in central Europe sets like this are beyond theit time : Most countries around have abandoned AM . For FM reception I use my cellphone these days . <p> Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two disadvantages : You need to plug in a headphone as an antenna and the speakers of these phones are extremely tiny und sound accordingly . But you could connect amplified stereo speakers instead of the headphone . <p> An outstanding FM receiver is in the SWISSTONE SC 560 that costs some 35 EUR . It is by a large margin the most sensitive handheld FM receiver I have . There might help that the electronics in this unit is comparatively simple and produces very little noise in the FM band . <p> Even many Android smartphones and tablets contain radios . They have the advantage that you can use them as Web radios , too . <p> FM reception hardly reduces the standby time . But Internet radio reception through WLAN or cell network drains the battery fast . Therefore you should consider this mostly for tablets . They have much larger batteries and you need no screen lighting to listen to a radio station . <p> DL4NO , its a different story here in the USA . My smartphone is a Samsung S4 Mini . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Russia with an analog FM radio installed and enabled . However , in the USA the telecom companies succeeded in disabling the FM radios in this phone and others like it , rendering broadcast FM reception inoperable . The phone companies wanted to promote data usage for music listening , not free analog radio . They got their way . Yes , My S4 Mini has the FM radio installed , but it ca n't be used in the USA . <p> I 'm afraid its true , the carriers here almost universally disable FM reception if the smartphone is capable . I believe Sprint is the exception to this rule , though . There is a consortium of radio broadcasters ( Next Radio ? ) that are pushing the cell companies to enable the FM chip as a matter of emergency preparedness , and a few models have trickled out with it enabled on AT&amp;T , if I remember correctly but that 's about it . I 'm on my third smartphone in 6 years that have FM chips in them but are disabled . And they all have locked bootloaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable them with third party software ! <p> I bought a Sony Walkman phone many , MANY moons ago off the internet , in the pre-iPhone mania days and it does have an FM radio with RDS . A very good radio for the small form factor , to be honest . But those are pretty rare in the US these days . You 're hard pressed to find a non-touchscreen smartphone for sell anywhere except online . <p> The best way to work around the carriers disabling of FM radios is to abandon their subsidized , locked-down phones and start purchasing unlocked phones from the manufacturers or retailers like Amazon . This was a bigger obstacle in previous years , but prices have plummeted and some really great phones are available at decent prices right now . And some of them have almost no bloatware ! I picked up my Motorola Moto G for around $220 earlier this year , and its specs are really decent . Nearly bloat-free , and its FM radio works really well ! <p> I use the Sony SRF-59 every day which was the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up per the ultralight websites . ) <p> The DT-160 will go off and leave it and its PLL SRF 37W sibling in the dust on FM , particularly in its ability to slice and dice FM signals , something neither Sony can do . <p> But note the smaller size of the 160s ferrite bar in the clear version.On AM both Sonys are way more sensitive but for general non-dx use the 160 will do OK on AM . Due to its small size Sangean probably did n't  have a choice in this set . <p> Thomas : Yes it is packaged in a nice small box and you can easily remove and play with it before giving it to your Dad . Suggestion : Just go ahead and order another one , have them send directly it to Dad after a few minutes with the 160 you 'll do this anyway . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

This is an exceptional radio in amazing condition . I can provide pics for someone who is seriously interested . I am open to a fair offer on radio . Please , no low-ballers . We all know what its worth <p> " We all know what its worth " ? <p> Well , it just so happened that- my good friend ( and Elmer , or ham radio guru ) Mike Hansgen ( K8RAT ) had recently- provided- me with a little history lesson on the subject of- the SX-88 , so I did know what this rig is worth : a- great deal of money . <p> But curiosity got the best of me , so I contacted Jeremy ( a nice fellow , by the way ) and asked what he was expecting to receive in exchange for- his Hallicrafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . It is a very rare unit ; it was only one of about 6 painted greenfor presentation to the military for evaluation . <p> That price is firm . I will not negotiate downward , and shipping from Ontario , Canada is extra . " <p> Ostermans wonderfully comprehensive- guide mentions that the SX-88 is a " highly regarded , rare and collectible model . " As for the rarity of the SX-88 , he describes it thus : " Extremely Scarce . " The used price range he gives is from $3,500-7,000 US . <p> " Its a lot of money for a receiver for certain , but it is a fantastic shortwave receiver as the audio that comes out of it is amazing . <p> It has 10 watts of audio and into a big speakerit is second to none . The fidelity is amazing and it is the king of its kind . For those who like tube rigs , it is the best of its kind . <p> For ham purposes on AM it is amazing , and on CW I find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they intended to pull all the stops out and build the best radio they could for the day with the military in mind . It was an engineering marvel for the day . <p> Anyway , I have played with it for years now and need to thin out the herd . " <p> Impressive . And while I just do n't  have that kind of money to fork out for a receiver , I did ask myself the question : " If I had $5,500 to blow , would I get that Hallicrafters SX-88 ? " <p> And my answer ? Yes. - In fact , I would personally drive to Jeremys home in Ontario and bring it back ; no way I 'd trust it to a parcel carrier or the post office <p> Click to enlarge ( Source : AntiqueRadio.org ) <p> Come on , you may say . For a guy who rarely pays over $50 for a vintage receiver , how could you possibly justify that kind of financial and time commitment ? <p> Well , let 's think of it this way . - I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first laptop in college . How much is it worth now ? Maybe twenty dollars ? <p> Many people have retirement funds in investments , some of which are in a variety of innovative companies that they actually patronizefor example , Apple or Microsoft . - But how often can you find an investment that you can actually play with ? One which you can turn on , tune in , work- the controls , and enjoy ? <p> Yes , I 'm sure this is just the sort of justification voiced by- many a vintage car collectorSo , why not for- a museum-worthy radio ? After all , they 're not making these anymore . <p> I expect this Halli will not only hold its value , but will probably increase in value over time . <p> Ah , well ; fun to ponder . - My question to you : Would you- buy a $5,500 vintage receiver if you had it to spare ? <p> If your answer is yes , and you do have the money , then you might want to contact Jeremy . <p> I 'm very curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , please comment with your thoughts about the 88 ! <p> And for the rest of us , just so we can revel in the vicarious pleasure of ownership , I 've included some additional information about the- Hallicrafters SX-88 below , including two videos . <p> Thank you Thomas for the nice notes on the sx88 . I am thrilled that we all still have the keen interest in these fine old radios . I wish they were not so expensive so all of us could have one as I know we all would enjoy it ! I was fortunate to come across this one and had some spare money at the time and jumped on it and am really glad I did . Anyway I just love the mystique of sitting on an early morning coffee in hand and tuning the bands listening to what is out there . I love to experiment with antennas and enjoy trying different antennas for that little bit of extra signal as we all do I am sure ! Anyway good luck with the Blog and I hope everyone here gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands and trying to capture that one rare location ! Good Dx and 73 to all . VA3JL <p> Wow ! what A radio ! I whish I could buy this one . Beside the cost of the set itself and the delivery cost , any " sofisticated " radio requiers ham license to be imported here in Israel : ordinary user or SWLer can not import something that is more than " AM/FM stereo portable " and that includes communication receiver . Anyway , this is one amazing radio ! I can only wish the new proud ouner many years of fun with this set . <p> Indeed Thomas : Anything more than Sangean ATS909X or the Sony ICF-SW7600GR is " suspected " by the custom and the ministry of comunication . Unless ones has A ham license , that allows him to issue permit t import A decent communication receiver . <p> If you cant afford shelling out 5k for a vintage boatanchor with brilliant mil-spec engineering inside , consider scouring German eBay for Siemens e309 and in particular e311 receivers . Shipping to the US may render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs like 100 pounds . ( OK , 38kg to be precise , still more than a IKEA couch ) <p> Finding a well-maintained and well-aligned example with good toobs when you 're located at or beyond the western shore of the big pond appears to be prohibitive of course , but what you get is German engineerink from a time when this term/slogan/blurb actually meant something . I had an e309 for a while , it set me back by 100 Deutschmarks back then , and it was the most impressive radio Ive ever seen or used . Its a ( IIRC ) 13-toob single conversion receiver with 4 ( ! ) tuned circuits ( featuring a variable capacitor with the diameter of a fat mans upper leg and 4 segments ) and continuously variable bandwidth between 0.5 and 10kHz . Despite being a single conversion receiver , it swallows any signal that any wire/antenna/beam/the Eiffel tower can throw at them without a hitch and it picked up yachts in the pacific for me , transmitting with 100w on 20m , while my other receivers , including a FRG-7700 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rig makes mechanics say " they do n't  make anything like this anymore " in tears . They were made in the 50s and served many years with the German army and navy , and on numerous merchant ships for decades , just needing a new toob every now and then . <p> The e311 is its 60s successor , with a mechanical digital frequency readout and a much refined double conversion circuitry , I never had one of those but they 're legend over here . They 're typically going on eBay for 600G/$700 , the e309 can be anything between $200 and $500 or more . The e311 has some optional spectrum display , RTTY convertors etc. a complete set can be quite expensive , but still much less than that rare SX-88 . <p> Of course you still have to keep in mind that while they are truly amazing professional receivers and a statement about mechanical quality , sturdiness and workmanship , they are still old analog boatanchors . Many modern SDR-based rigs are in the same wheelhouse price-wise but they weigh 37 kilograms less and come without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply woes re toobs and with warranty . But you admire giant cog wheel gears made of indestructible steel in your radio , these old Siemens receivers are sure something you should do some Google research on . <p> I had one of these radios in much earlier days and it was absolutely first-rate . Interesting to note that the CommRadio Cr-1a can do more and is only about 16 cubic inches , but no significant speaker is included . The only problem with tube radios is finding the tubes . I suppose that are all being made by the Chinese and Russians . <p> David , NOS receiving tubes are easy to find on eBay , often at very favorable prices . NOS tubes usually test and work as good as new despite their age . A tube substitution book is a useful tool especially when looking for JAN tubes which are often of better quality than the consumer market counterparts . <p> I honestly think this radio is so revered because most people have never heard , or tuned one . It has taken on a mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today that can be very enjoyable to tune and listen to , that cost thousands less , and look every bit as nice . Restored SX-28 , 42 , 62 , or 71s will provide fantastic listening experiences , and can be found and used today . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207295 @3907295/ 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 7 thoughts on " Jay Allens review of the Tecsun PL-880 " <p> I received my PL880 yesterday from Anon-Co who were excellent in their customer service and as a result , I would have no hesitation recommending them . On unboxing the radio , I was pleased to find a solid , well made radio with excellent inclusions and a well written User Manual in English . I was eager to test the radio . On close inspection , I too found what appears to be fine cracks on the front face of the radio which I suspect may be due to the manufacturing process . This has been commented on before by other owners . Other than that , as mentioned , the radio has a solid feel about it and I found it to have excellent ergonomics . Now to the performance . I tested the radio against a Degen 1103 , Tecsun S2000 , Tecsun PL660 , Tecsun PL 310 , Sony EX5-Mk2 , Sangean 909X and a Sangean PR-D5 . I used the internal aerials of the radios only , telescopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Firstly FM , this radio showed excellent sensitivity on FM and excellent selectivity , I was able to hear signals ( just ) from Sydney over 200kms away , the only radio that was capable of receiving signals from that distance . An outstanding result for a portable . Next to AM . Here I was surprised to find the Degen 1103 outperforming the Tecsuns for the ability to receive recoverable audio from distant AM signals so the nod goes to the Degen 1103 here . None of the radios however matched the outstanding performance of the Sony EX5 Mk2 or the Sangean PR-D5 here on MW . Comparing the PL880 to the PL660 , found me thinking the 660 was slightly more sensitive on MW . Very little in it , but the audio of the 880 was better . On SW , the order of performance from best to worst I found as follows ; Tecsun S2000 , Degen 1103 , Tecsun PL660 and PL880 equal , Tecsun PL310 then the Sangean 909X . Again , recoverable audio on distant signals was fractionally better on the Degen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Panasonic DR22 ( RF2200 ) against them with the expected results , none were a match for the DR22 ! As mentioned by others , the Synch detector was a disappointment on the 880 , just does n't  match the PL660 or the Sony ICF2001D in that department . SSB was a different kettle of fish , here the PL880 was superb . By far the best portable tested to receive SSB. ( of course the PL310 does n't  resolve SSB ) . The worst , by the way , was the Sangean 909X , the 880 far outperformed the Sangean . So what do I like about the radio ? Great construction , excellent audio for a small portable and reasonable overall performance but not outstanding . Great SSB and FM performance . What I do n't  like , poor Synch detector and a very annoying strong digital artifact on 783 khz MW which blocks the radio . A nuisance as that is an interesting DX frequency for me . Could I recommend purchasing it ? Yes , but do n't  expect stellar performance , it certainly is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its designed for very nicely , a small portable radio . My firmware version is 8820 and I set the parameters as recommended on the previous posts . <p> Hi , Anyone having the same issues with spurious signals on thier Tecsun PL880 ? This one , see attached video , crops up between 781khz and 783khz with a strong signal blocking any reception on those frequencies . I have made Anna from Anon-Co aware of this and she is hopefully speaking to Tecsun about a possible fix . Any comments appreciated . <p> Yes , my 880 also has a peak rf on 783KHz . Hmmm ! I keep hearing good reports on the Degen 1103 . I can get a new one for around $50.00 . I have an indoor antenna and cant receive very well on SW . Would the 1103 give me much better reception than the 880 . I also have the Sangean 909x ; everyone is correct , it does n't  match performance of the 880 although I like the size , features , looks of the 909x . Comments Please . Edwin Thoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if the same is the case with your 880 , hopefully not . I really do n't  want to send it back if I can help it , hopefully there may be a " fix " to sort it out .

@@75207300 @3907300/ <p> I think large part of the sensitivity problem has to due with the DSP . Every DSP based receiver Ive seen in recent years has acted exactly the same way with very weak signals .

@@75207301 @3907301/ <h> A review of the ShouYu SY-X5 DSP shortwave radio <p> The- ShouYu SY-X5 shortwave radio came to my attention only a few weeks ago . It is yet one more mechanically-tuned , DSP based , portable shortwave/AM/FM radio . I have reviewed several other models based on the same DSP chipset : the Silicon Labs SI4844see my reviews of the Degen DE321 , Degen DE32 , and the Kichbo KK-9803 . I also recently reviewed the Tecsun R-2010D , though it is based on a slightly newer , though similar , SiLabs DSP chipset . <p> What makes the ShouYu SY-X5 stand out is the fact that it can be powered by either a rechargeable slim battery pack ( found in the DE32 ) or three standard AA batteries . - It also has a built-in MP3 player that uses a standard microSD card for media storage . Why are these features of particular note for me ? - I have been searching for a shortwave radio/mp3 player for use by my charitable non-profit , Ears To Our World . ETOW works in parts of the world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet ( or else simply cant afford Internet service ) . In such settings , radio allows teachers and school children to hear up-to-date international news via shortwave , and through pre-recorded educational material , they can play ( and replay ) MP3 content as needed . <p> Therefore , I immediately ordered an SY-X5 for review here , hoping to donate it for use in the field care of Ears To Our World . <p> First impressions <p> Degen DE321 ( left ) Shouyu SY-X5 ( right ) <p> The ShouYu SY-X5 is a small radio , almost exactly the same size as the very portable Grundig G6 and only slightly larger than the Degen DE321 ( see left ) . It feels sturdy and even slightly heavy in your hand ( no doubt , due to the number of batteries it holds ) . The antenna is rotatable and feels more robust than other radios in its price class . <p> The SY-X5 has a back stand that likewise feels sturdy enough . Note : to open the battery compartment , you must lift up the back stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect for $27 ( US ) , with one notable exception : the printed frequency display behind the analog dial on my unit is positioned slightly off-center and not level , making needle position on the dial , well , frankly ambiguous . <p> Audio <p> Without a doubt , the greatest aspect of the SY-X5 is the audio delivered from the built-in speaker . It is exceptional for this size radio , full and with impressive bass characteristics . It very much reminds me of the Melson M7 ( not yet reviewed here ) and the Degen DE1129 . <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Performance <p> I 've reviewed enough of these mechanically-tuned DSP-based radios now that I 'm beginning to note performance commonalities that can only be- attributed- to the design of the DSP chipset itself ( regardless of how they are implemented in each model of radio ) . <p> At risk of sounding like a broken record , this radios sensitivity , selectivity and AGC performance is nearly identical to the Degen DE321 on every band ; here 's a summary : <p> Shortwave <p> sensitivity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty- coping with weak station and fading <p> selectivity is mediocre <p> Medium Wave ( AM ) <p> strong daytime stations sound great <p> the SY-X5s AGC circuit struggles with night time conditions , even with some strong stations <p> selectivity is mediocre <p> FM <p> FM performance is quite good <p> Both selectivity and sensitivity are great for the pricein this case , $27 US <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Between the two FM bands , the SY-X5 should easily accommodate world-wide FM broadcasts ( even Russia ) . The two AM ( medium wave ) bands are almost identical in frequency allocation , but have been set up so that one is on 9 kHz spacing and the other on the 10 kHz spacing typically used here in North America ( nice touch ) . <p> Tuning <p> While the " feel " of the tuning wheel on the right side of the radio seems smooth , in reality it is not . The tension or actual mechanics behind the analog tuner are problematic ; I find that upon tuning in even a strong station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately moves off-frequency . Its most annoying . Over the course of several days of use , it does n't  seem that the mechanism has broken in at all as I had hoped . This is perhaps the biggest negative of the ShouYu SY-X5 ; it is just not easy to accurately tune it . <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> MP3 Player <p> While I have n't spent hours using the MP3 player , I find that its simple , yet quite effective . Most notably , it lacks fast-forward and reverse controls , though it does have buttons for ten-second skips both in the forward and reverse- directions . Of course , you can pause , stop and skip to next/previous MP3 files . <p> The SY-X5 has a dedicated MP3 player red LED display ; it is very brightalmost too bright , in fact , for low light conditionsand quite simple , offering only basic functions ( no alpha-numeric tags , for example ) . Unfortunately , I find that the LED display does inject a little noise into the audio , but its nothing that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Summary <p> Every radio has positive and negative attributes ; below are the pros and cons I noted from the moment I unpacked the SY-X5 : <p> The ShouYu SU-X5 is very similar , performance-wise , to the Degen DE321 . Out of all of the mechanically-tuned DSP portables reviewed thus far , the SY-X5 may have the best audio fidelity via its built-in speaker ( save the Tecsun R-2010D ) . Also , like other similarly sized and priced models in this family , the SY-X5 has tuning issues ; in its case , a tuning wheel that will not stay on frequency without practice . <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> I 've decided to take my SY-X5 , on behalf of Ears To Our World , to inner Belize City in the near future .

While the SY-X5 has shortcomings , for this particular useserving an individual who will not rely primarily on sight , but on tactile response , to operate itI think it may serve its purpose . Perhaps this will be the best litmus test for the SY-X5s utility and longevity : - I may post an update when I receive feedback in approximately one year , as to whether this radio has required repair , replacement , or has offered ( as I sincerely hope ! ) some measure of benefit to the child-owner . <p> Very good review . You saved my US $25 . I am confused what to buy under a tight budget ! I narrowed my search to Tecsun R-909 for US $21 and Tecsun DR-920 priced US $26 ! I need your advice to choose the better one between them . <p> If you can deal with the ambiguous tuning of an analog radio , I would suggest the R-909 . It will probably deliver better overall performance . In all of my experience with radios under $40 , I find that analog radios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative is the lack of precise ( digital ) tuning . <p> Of course , if you 're only planning to listen to powerhouse stations , I would side with the DR-920 . Just make sure the frequencies you wish to target are included in its band selections . <p> I 'm pleased overall with my SY-DP100 labeled version of this radio . I like the heaviness ; it makes the set feel more substantial . The tuning scale on mine is well-positioned and overall the radio has a professional look . Shortwave reception improves greatly when I use the included wire antenna ( nice to have the external antenna jack feature ! ) , along with a few feet of counterpoise wire connected to the earphone jack and hung to the floor . Yes , tuning the radio takes a bit of practice on all bands , but the dial on mine turns easily with no apparent " play " or tension . MW reception is mainly limited to locals and the stronger distant nighttime stations . I do get enough MW stations to make this a useful receiver . FM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got my set for US$27.50 from DealXtreme ( they are now temporarily sold out ) . For me this radio is a keeper I especially like the external antenna jack ! <p> I 'm looking for a radio for my Grandfather , he likes to listen to old time radio programs , I have a number of them I would like to put on an SD card for him , do you know how large of a card this will take ? This seems like the perfect radio for his needs , but do you have any recommendations for a SD.MP3 player/radio ? <p> This is probably the best pick for a shortwave radio with MP3 player . Its very simple to operate and he should have no problems reading the display . <p> With an internal microSD card , you should be able to put 16 GB or even more in the radio for your grandfather to play . The only negative is that the player is super simpleyou cycle through each program by pressing the forward button . There 's no way ( I know of ) to skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before taking it to Belize and giving it to a visually impaired child . So far , the feedback is most positive . <p> Good thing is , at this price , its not going to be a huge risk . If he did n't  care for the radio portion , you could get him an iPod shuffle or another mp3 only device . Let us know what you choose &amp; good luck ! Sounds like your grandfather is in for a treat . <p> sorry , just posting another comment just so i can get an email notification . thank you for your service , once i found this radio it looked perfect , yours was the only review i could find . its not stellar , but its still very promising . cheers <p> Nice review ! I am confused considering the options of Shouyu SY-X5 , Tecson R909 and Degen DE321 . My requirement is a decent shortwave radio which picks up at least the strong stations ( I am not expecting weak station dx-ing at this price range ) . I think that Tecson R909 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by Shouyu is tempting me as an added feature . My doubts are as follows : - 1 . Is the background noise while playing mp3 in Shouyu so bad that you will not recommend it ? 2 . Between truly analog radio ( Tecson R909 ) and analog tuned digital radio ( Shouyu and Degen DE321 ) which one would be better for ease of shortwave tuning ? Thanks , <p> Personally , I would stick with the Tecsun R909 ; especially is shortwave listening is your goal . <p> Tuning a DSP-based mechanically tuned radio like the DE321 or the SY-X5 is frustrating . An analog radio gives you a better opportunity to band scan as you hear stations come and go as you tune past them . A DSP radio has frequency steps locked in at 5kHz increments . Quite often , you can pass by a station and not even hear it , if you tune too quickly . The best of the DSP ( mechanically-tuned ) bunch is the R-2010Dmainly , because it has a large analog dial ( but terrible LONG ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this price range . That would be my choice , at least . <p> Hello Thomas , As per your advice and after lot of reading from swling , I took the plunge and bought my first shortwave radio : R-909. = I am overall pleased with the quality of audio from the speaker . The FM and MW tuning were good . I could hear many shortwave stations , even inside my room with windows closed , with the extended antenna . I plan to go through broadcast schedules and listen specific stations ; I am feeling excited to do swling . Hope the radio I received is not defective and will last . <p> And I think you 're not only a good reviewer but also a good person as well for making donations to poor people worldwide . People like you inspire me and widen my thought in a sense . While I just stick to hobbies , you 're finding a way to make better world , even in your own hobby . <p> I 'm from Republic of Korea ( S .

And I think I will buy Tecsuns PL 660 some day , though I 'm not sure . = You helpled me a lot in making good choice . Thank you so much . <p> Yes , I 'll sure let you know . = Thank you . I 've seen all of them on ebay already , but PL-660 caught my sight the most because it has very intersting functions such as SSB and airband , which would enable me to intercept the truckers and pilots talk . = though I 'm not sure what use it is for . haha <p> I just paid for " PL-310ET " Last night . = They said its virtually the best DSP receiver ever issued on that price level , and especially the best in FM receiving too . I 'm just a beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard of having another thing I can not fully make use of . So , even if I use it just as a conventional FM radio , it would be good choice . PL-660 was thought to be too much for me in price and its multi function . I was not sure if I could use all the function it offers . = Thank you for giving information for me to make better choice . I wish I would have chance to tell you how lovely it works in a reply to this posting . I 'd appreciate if you check it out and give your comments . <p> I got it on May . 12 ( Mon ) , but I have n't tested it outdoors yet . The radio felt much smaller acutally than was seen online shop photo . I mistook the off for on when I first turned it on , I spent a long time trying to find out how to get it tuned , until I finally found that it was left off . = The backlight was on when it was off , toohow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test was with its own telescopic antenna only , <p> The FM was just plain , and the AM plain , shortwave received 5 or more Chinese or Japanese broadcasts . I have another radio with 2 bands only , Sony ICF-F10. which has good reception , I think . Compared with that , my PL-310ET seem to have equal or a bit inferior reception . Perhaps , its just because of the difference of the bigger speaker which sounds more soft and clear . Anyway , the noise sounds bigger on PL-310ET . <p> The shortwaveI have no other radios for a comparison or reference . So it was impossible for me to check how greatly it receives.the shortwave . And I have no idea about the local receiving rate of the city where I live now . Does n't  it matter in that scale ? Shortwaves are affected by the radios location in the room ? More than the city scale ? I do n't  know exactly . The sound of shorwave was a bit harshIve heared that you should not expect the FM sound in shortwave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , prehaps , but not me. = <p> In overallI think it has good performance as a normal 2 band radio and good shortwave reception too . ( though I have no reference for short wave reception . ) I would have thought that 's not enough for this little radio through realtively-long-time overseas shipping from china , had it not been for the convenient functions such as ETM , big LCD , number keypads , and smart design . <p> Someday I would acquire an external antenna unit enabling more precise shortwave reception . But before then , I would enjoy the covenience of the user interface and smart and neat design of this black little portable radio mainly for 2 bands . = Just as the fate of any other shortwave radio in wrong hands , wrong place . = 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

The PL-310ET is an amazing little DX machine ! Clint has certainly put it to the test . I think what I 'm asking about are those whove recently purchased the 310ET ( in 2017 ) to determine if there 's simply a bad batch being sold . <p> The PL-310ET is a great radio for the price . The si4734 DSP chip is the winner and provides selectable bandwidths to limit co-channel interference with great sensitivity . The Easy Tune feature is actually very useful , especially if you move about a lot for business . If only Tecsun could add SSB into the form factor of the PL-310ET = <p> I recently received and reviewed the 310ET on my YouTube channel ( hamrad88 ) and found it to be a very good performer . I have seen quality control problems on radios coming out of China lately . For instance the Eton Executive Satellit radio I reviewed was not impressive but others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . = <p> I ordered mine from Amazon shortly before Christmas 2016 ( December 23 ) based on all the positive descriptions of it on your site , and I am very pleased with this radio . Very well made ( I accidentally knocked it to the floor without any i 'll effects ) , excellent sensitivity , especially on FM , and great sound from a small speaker . <p> Regarding the eham reviews , take them with a pinch of salt , true , there may have been QC issues but the second review giving a 1 out of 5 rating which is very harsh indeed . Yes , MW is not the best but shortwave is superb and you are not going to get Hi-Fi quality from a 2 inch speaker . Overall a cracking portable radio IMHO . <p> I do n't  want to sound like a sinophobic grampa but I 've had a big enough share of DOA and . Die-too-soon events with chinese made electronics to get the impression that QC is stilan issue . Tecsun is no exception the first PL-660 I got stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement . unit developed an unhealthy static build-up when its running for a while and now the antenna jack starts failing after using it like 10 times a typical issue . 8d be happy to pay more money for better quality and better reliability , but even if I pay a lot more , like for my chinese made Alinco , still getting failing encoders , failing jacks and a first unit being even more defective than the replacement . <p> In our hobbyist circles , these radios are often sitting between non-chinese-made radios that have working jacks and knobs that still do their job after several decades <p> Hi there , I 'm not so surprised this receiver has been given a bad review or two on eHam.net . A written summary of the effectiveness of a radio receiver is , by its very nature , subjective . Unless you 're presenting hard evidence that a certain feature is not up to specification , then its always going to be open to interpretation . Empircal evidence in the form of measured performance is best of course , but if that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a signal ( or signals ) is very useful . I have tested the PL-310ET with longwires , an 800 ft barbed wire fence and an ALA1530 . Using these various antennas I have heard and recorded , KCBS Pyongyang , ABC Northern Territories , Zambia NBC Radio 1 , Bangladesh Betar , Radio Guinea , Radio Fana , RTM Sarawak , Radio Nacional Brasilia , amongst many others . Intentionally , the stations Ive listed here are n't  the easiest signals to hear on shortwave , in fact some of them are quite difficult to copy on a high-end portable . <p> So , what can we conclude ? Fundamentally there is clearly nothing wrong with the design of the PL-310ET . In fact , for the very modest price , its a brilliant radio ; I ca n't think of a better portable in terms of performance as a function of price . Poor reviews such as those highlighted have to be down to either a bad manufacturing batch and I run a manufacturing company , so I know all about poor yield it happens . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract the best performance out of their radio . Thomas Brogan was spot on when he stated that the PL-310ET is actually a better-built radio than some of Tecsuns more expensive models and rather untypically for a Chinese manufactured radio , actually feels like a quality product . Mine is certainly superior to the PL-680 I previously owned ; that radio started falling apart straight out of the box . Whenever I 'm asked ( and it happens quite frequently ) , I always strongly recommend the PL-310ET as a budget portable that capable of real DX . <p> I have just taken receipt of a 310 today . I hooked it up to my external antenna ( half size window ) and I have to say I was disappointed considering the rave reviews . It appears to overload very easily but OK on the internal whip . MW however is superb . So perhaps mine is from a poor batch too and I need to get back to Anna at anon-co . I have watched Clints video amongst others who have praised the 310 so I am a little surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would only judge the 310ET based on what it does with the whip antenna . Its a small portable and they 're just not as well equipped to handle any sort of largish external antenna . Of course , I believe Clint has had very good luck with it hooked up to one . <p> Here " s my experience with a PL-310ET purchased in November of 2016 which I have tested under various conditions for several months now . My main complaint is the annoying volume pumping on strong stations on speech modulation peaks both on medium wave and shortwave . I figure this may perhaps be due to a too responsive AGC . I found that by tuning 1 Khz off up or down the center frequency of the received station the volume pumping is eliminated , however with a significant drop in overall audio level . I thought perhaps I had just gotten a defective unit , but a PL-380 purchased just in March of 2017 also exhibits the same volume pumping . On stations with relatively steady modulation ( audio compression/limiting ) this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future production batches . Otherwise , both radios are top-notch receivers . For best shortwave reception I connect to an external antenna as the built-in whip does not do a good job at receiving weak signals at my location in the central Philippines . <p> I purchased one now in July . And as Vivencio Flores says the AGC is not good , that is my main claim . It should not be that way , really annoying . The bandwidth control is also not so good in the widest mode , but for that price , one can not expect so much , but the AGC should have been better anyway , is nearly useless . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207316 @3907316/ <h> Portable antennas : a review of the Par Electronics EF-SWL <p> Last August and part of September , - I traveled- through the US with the CommRadio CR-1 and a couple of portable antennas : the- Par Electronics EF-SWL and - NASA PA-30 . I had the opportunity to try both in the field , and took notes as I used them . Following is a short review of the- Par Electronics EF-SWL . <p> The EF-SWL ready to deploy . <p> Par Electronics EF-SWL- <p> At the Dayton Hamvention last- year , I had the pleasure of speaking with representatives of- the North Carolina-based LNR Precision Inc . LNR is a mom-and-pop company with- a focus on providing antennas , keys , and transceivers for the ham radio and shortwave listener markets . - Indeed I have several SWL friends who use on a daily basis an antenna this company manufactures and retails : the- Par Electronics EF-SWL . LNR asked if I would consider reviewing their antenna , and- since I- was planning- a road trip with radios in towthe perfect opportunity to test such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-fed shortwave antenna designed for 1-30 MHz reception . Its a receive only-antennaperfect for the SWL . The radiator is 45 feet of #14 black polyethylene coated Flex-Weave wire . When I first used the EF-SWL , I noted the quality of its construction : no doubt it can withstand many deployments in all weather conditionsand its manufactured here in the US . <p> With a 45 ' radiator , the EF-SWL needs a little space , but offers more gain than the other portable antenna I packed , the NASA PA-30 ( look for its review in the near future ) . I put- the EF-SWL to use in New Mexico where several- large trees were readily available . I hooked the EF-SWL up to the CommRadio CR-1 and simply hung the end of the radiator as high as I could in a nearby tree . Though not a picture-perfect installation , it nonetheless certainly did the trick ! I did n't  bother with a ground connection as I was n't in an area with much radio noise ( RFI ) . <p> In the past , when setting up- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own antenna either for the specific meter band I hoped to use , or brought along a portable antenna tuner . It was quite nice having an antenna designed to be resonant on the broadcast bands . <p> Though I did n't  do this , I did noticed that the EF-SWLs- radiator is attached via a stainless studPar Electronics did this so you can remove the radiator and replace it with a different wire length . With the stock 45 ' radiator , I still find the EF-SWL quite portable , especially when compared with most of the portable amateur radio antennas I use , which tend to take- a dipole or delta loop configuration . <p> After returning from my trip , I decided to hook up the EF-SWL at my home base for longer-term evaluation . These- past months I 've had it on the air as an auxiliary antenna , and I 've been impressed with its performance . In truth , its not in an optimal location hanging off the corner of my house , but I think this may actually represent with some accuracy the installation- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placement that must factor in- antenna restrictions or limited space . Of course , for any permanent installation , you will need to ground the EF-SWL for lower noise reception . <p> And yet , even in these suboptimal conditions , the antenna performs remarkably well . <p> As with any exterior antenna , of course , take precautions against lightening if you live in an area with thunder storms . If nothing else , at least disconnect the antenna when not in use . <p> Moving forward , I will plan to relocate the EF-SWL to a more ideal- permanent location and most likely purchase another- to keep in my antenna bag . I- hope- to use this antenna in a DXpedition I 've planned later this year . <h> 12 thoughts on " Portable antennas : a review of the Par Electronics EF-SWL " <p> I use this exact antenna for all of my shortwave listening . I find it to be the perfect compromise of size versus performance .

It would be interesting to hear a comparison or two . Perhaps other readers have both antennas and could run a test and post some results . Have you used any kind of pre-amp with the PAR , and if so , was their any significant improvement ? <p> Yes , I too would definitely like to see that EF-SWL vs .

Any recommendations on how to end the problem , so I can use it for its portability ? <p> I 've had one of these in use for a few years now . In fact I bought mine back when Dale Parfitt ( W4OP ) was selling them from his website at Par Electronics . It is indeed everything that people says it is , and I cant say anything but good stuff about such a simple and basic antenna that simply works , and works well . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

When software defined radios ( SDRs ) came to the market many years ago , I honestly thought I 'd never use one , certainly never as my main receiverafter all , who wants to turn on a computer just to listen to the radio ? <p> Who , indeed ? - I 've discovered that I do ! <p> The WinRadio WR-G31DDC " Excalibur " <p> Over the past year , since I 've become more and more engaged in shortwave radio audio archiving , I realized I needed to get a tool for making this a simpler , even more automated process . Clearly , I needed to find an SDR for the job . So , last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that would best suit my needs as a discriminating shortwave radio listener , ham radio operator , and amateur radio archivist . And since I wanted to be able to record spectrum , I needed a true SDR , not a PC-controlled IF receiver . <p> Several considerations steered me toward the WinRadio Excalibur over , say , the Microtelecom Perseus , the RF Space NetSDR , SDR IQ , or the QS1R Quicksilverall models with which the Excalibur is often compared . It was a tough decision , and I 'll go into greater detail about my selection- criteria in a future post on SDRs . But the overarching factor that guided my final decision ? Simply put , it was the Excaliburs robust recording functionality . <p> I 'm grateful to WinRadio for giving me a loaner Excalibur to evaluate over a two month period of timeat the end of which , I decided that I liked the radio so much , I purchased it from them for the same price they offered to their customers at the 2012 Dayton Hamvention . <p> The WinRadio Excalibur is manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the Excalibur receiver in my hands , I was a little surprised by its sizeits a bit smaller than I expected . The radio itself is not much larger than a typical portable shortwave radio , thus , its quite easy to fit into a laptop case for mobile DXing . The unit itself has very few connections ; just three , in fact : <p> On the " front " of the radio , there 's only a blue LED light ( which can be controlled by the Excalibur software ) , and a power button . <p> The chassis is made of a durable transparent polymer , and inside , the receiver is protected by a metal enclosure . Frankly , its a pretty sleek looking piece of gear , and its footprint is small enough not to take up much space on a desktop . In fact , it resembles an external hard drive more than it does a receiver . <p> The Excalibur application software : a brief introduction <p> Allow me to begin by saying , the WinRadio Excalibur application software is very easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10MBthus it installs very quickly . In fact , if you want to check out the application for yourself , its a free download from WinRadios website . If you do n't  have an Excalibur radio hooked up to your computer , the software will allow you to run in " Demo Mode , " in which you can explore settings , customization , etc . <p> Good news : the WinRadio Excalibur is purely " plug-and-play . " You load the application , you plug the radio into your PC , and it works . <p> The virtual control panel <p> The application softwares graphic user interface ( GUI ) or as WinRadio calls it , the " virtual control panel " has a very logical layout : <p> In the upper left part of the window ( see screenshot below ) you 'll find the frequency display and tabs for each of the three individual virtual receivers you can use within the allotted spectrum bandwidth ( see above ) . In the middle of this section , you 'll find a tuning knob and configurable analog-styled meter . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the mode controls , along with memory , filters , audio mixing , notch , squelch , gain , and the noise blanker . <p> The control panel , otherwise , is divided into three main spectrum windows : <p> The top right window displays the spectrum as seen by the currently selected virtual receiver . Its within this window that you can tune , change the passband , visually adjust the notch filter , and even view the audio spectrum . It is , essentially , the IF spectrumWinRadio calls this the " Demodulator Spectrum . " <p> The top left window contains the DDC spectrum , the bandwidth of which can vary anywhere from - 20 kHz to 2 MHz , selectable- in 21 steps . All three virtual receivers can be used simultaneously within the DDC spectrum bandwidth ; in other words , if the DDC is set to a 1 MHz bandwidth between 9,200-10,200 kHz , you could listen to and/or record broadcasters on 9,580 and 9,625 kHz and 9,990 kHz. - The DDC spectrum window will show shaded areas which represent the location and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window contains the Wideband Spectrum Scope , which , essentially , gives you a view of the entire HF spectrum from 0-30 or 0-50 MHz . I typically keep mine set to 0-30 MHz , as I rarely use the 30-50 MHz portion , and - it otherwise shrinks the wideband spectrum view to display the additional coverage . Perhaps what 's most useful about this scope is that it imparts the ability to " see " propagation conditions across the HF band . - Also , in this setting , I can switch between two antennas in order to see what portions of the HF spectrum each one best receives . <p> The DDC window displaying spectrum ( click to enlarge ) <p> The DDC and Wideband spectrum windows are selectable between a standard spectrum look or a waterfall display . - The waterfall has several color schemes to select from , as well . In the image above , I show a standard spectrum display for the DDC window , and the yellow waterfall display for the wideband spectrum . Unlike the Microtelecom Perseus , the Excalibur GUI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill your monitor screen . Additionally , the spectrum windows can also be re-sized to your liking . <p> The DDC window displaying waterfallnote that there are several waterfall color schemes ( click to enlarge ) <p> Tuning in <p> Ease of tuning is a very important factor for an SDRespecially for someone like me , who really has an appreciation for the traditional , tactile tuning knob of a tabletop radio. - Fortunately , the Excalibur is very simple to tune , and you have options in this respect , too . - While you can use your mouse pointer to " turn " the virtual tuning knob at the top of the control panel , I find using my PCs keyboards up and down arrows to be even easier , and using these allows me to retain a sense of tactile control . If you have a mouse with a scroll button ( which I highly recommend ) you can tune with this , as well . Of course , you can also easily tune the receiver by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer within the DDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF receivers Ive reviewed or used have some limitations with tuning . For example , the Perseus requires that you click a button to display a keypad box before you can enter a frequency directly . On the Excalibur , you simply type the numberand if you wish , you can even specify MHz or kHz by trailing with an " M " or " K. " - So , if you want to go to 15,550 kHz , you simply type " 15550 . " If you want 15,000 kHz ( a.k.a. 15 MHz ) , you can simply type " 15M . " No extra keypad windows to open. - You can also assign frequency memory locations to your keyboards function keys . <p> Performance <p> Though the look-and-feel , layout , and overall usability of the Excalibur are important , the " rubber meets the road " in real- receiver performance . The fact is , if you 're spending $900 US for a receiver , you want to know that you 're getting a good value . <p> Rest assuredwith the Excalibur , you are . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must confessI love this Excalibur . Despite my initial hesitancy , this radio has proven itself , and thoroughly won me over . The Excalibur is , in short , the best SDR I have ever used. - As far as I can tell , it runs neck-and-neck with the Microtelecom Perseus in sensitivity , selectivity , and overall receiver performance . The Perseus may have an edge with its adjustable DSP , but the Excalibur has an overall edge with its AM sync detector and flexible filter/mode controls. - This is my SDR . <p> By using the AMS mode and only selecting the lower side band sync , the interference seen in the upper side band is completely eliminated from the reception ( click to enlarge ) <p> AM Sync Detection ( AMS mode ) <p> The AM sync detector ( AMS ) on the Excalibur is nothing short of amazing . Though it can be a little slow to lock and is noticeably- slow to self-adjust if a transmission drifts off-frequency , its a highly effective tool to cope with weak signal selective fading . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that bleeds into the passband can be effectively and often- completely eliminated by simply engaging the AMS on the sideband that is clear of the- adjacent- noise . This is remarkable. - For example , if you are listening to a weak signal on 15,585 kHz but a strong signal on 15,590 kHz is causing interference in the upper side band ( easily seen on the spectrum scope ) , simply engage the AMS on the lower side band . Time and time again , I 've found this to be even more effective than using a combination of the passband and notch filtering . <p> With strong signals , AMS is simply not needed most of the time . I have , however , engaged it several times while recording music ( say , the- Voice of Greece ) to either lower noise from adjacent broadcasts , or simply to decrease the noise floor . <p> Automatic Gain Control ( AGC ) <p> The Excaliburs pre-defined AGC levels of slow , medium and fast are quite effective , and easy to switch between . But if you wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay , setting the reference level and max gain to your own specifications , and even saving it as a personalized user setting . This personalized option will then appear as a selection under the pre-defined AGC settings . <p> Of course , you can also adjust the gain manually , but I find that I rarely need to do so . <p> The Excaliburs notch filter can be adjusted by frequency and width ( click to enlarge ) <p> Notch <p> At first , I found using the Excaliburs notch filter a little clumsy to use as compared with that of the Perseus . As with other mode adjustments and filters , the Excalibur employs a set of drop-down menus to adjust the notch . Initially I found it cumbersome to move the notch on top of interference by selecting the exact frequency from the drop-down menu . But as I 've worked with the Excalibur a bit more , I find I now actually prefer the Excaliburs method . <p> here 's why. - To use the notch , you simply select the notch tab , click the engage button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by selecting the frequency drop-down menu and using the scroll wheel on your mouse , the notch will move across the passband accordingly . Once you 've covered the- interference- with the notch , you can adjust its width with a drop-down menuit can be widened up to 2 kHz , if needed . <p> You 'll find the notch especially valuable when listening within crowded ham bands or where the ham bands and AM broadcasters overlap , of course . Again , most of the time , I turn to the AMS for eliminating QRM on the broadcast bands . <p> Other features <p> Frankly , the Excalibur has so many features that its beyond the scope of my review to include them all . By and large , I find I like them all . Though I rarely need or use the squelch feature on HF , it is effective and highly adjustable . The Excalibur also has a noise blanker which I rarely need to use , since I no longer live in an area with RFI or an electric fence ( though I would love reader comments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine there must be a modest learning curve , but it will probably pay off to master it if needed . <p> The Audio filters are also amazingI use them frequently to tweak audio fidelity while making broadcast recordings with wide bandwidth . Indeed , in the Demodulation window , you can select the audio spectrum and actually move the filter- threshold- within the spectrum . This is a greatand highly visualway of eliminating unwanted audio noise . <p> The only feature I feel like WinRadio falls short in , is its Memory . I do n't  have an issue with assigning user memoriesthis is a quite simple process , and you can even assign key memory locations to the function buttons on your keyboardbut I do n't  like the display of frequency databases like EIBI and HFCC . The scrollable window for the frequency databases is simply too small , and does n't  contain enough information . I find that the Microtelecom Perseus memory display strikes the right balanceit reads the broadcast times and only displays what should be on frequency . The Bonito RadioJet ( an IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying the broadcaster info within the spectrum display. - While this is n't a make-or-break item for me , as I routinely check my copy of WRTH or other online sources for frequencies and schedules , I just hope WinRadio takes note , and considers enhancing this feature in a future update . <p> Recording <p> Recording , in my opinion , is where the Excalibur really shines . For many readers , the recording feature may be one of the least important . But for me , a busy dad with an active family life who enjoys recording and archiving shortwave broadcast , as well as listening at my leisure when my home is quiet , I rely on both automatic recording and spectrum recordings . <p> With the ability to record up to 2 MHz of bandwidth , you can easily capture an entire meter band , and play back the DCC recording later as if it were livemeaning , you can fully adjust every receiver parameter and every filter . Indeed , each of the three virtual receivers can be adjusted and filtered independently of each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum . <p> One glance at the wideband spectrum displayin the lower portion of the display will tell you what meter bands the current propagation conditions favor ( click to enlarge ) <p> I often use this recording method to capture late-night openings or broadcasts I might miss while sleeping or away from home . I have even- recorded- the entire medium wave band throughout the night , then listened later for late-night trans-Atlantic DX . <p> Capturing large chunks of spectrum , however , is not for the hard drive-challenged . A 2 MHz recording could easily use up 100 GB of hard drive space per hour ( depending on other factors , like your demodulator filter length ) . In reality , though , there 's never really a need to capture that much spectrum at once . <p> You can also make a basic audio recording within a virtual receiver without recording the spectrum . This is an important feature that the Perseus lacksit can only record spectrum . You can actually schedule the Excalibur to record broadcasts automaticallyit even allows you to set the bandwidth , mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to record something particularly important , like a one-time event on one frequency , I record the spectrum at 20 kHz wide . This does not take up much hard drive space and allows me to go back later and tweak the filters throughout the broadcast ( say , if QRM appears halfway through ) . <p> Again , the remarkable recording functionality of this SDR is truly what prompted me to pull the trigger on the Excalibur over other- similarly-priced SDRs . <p> Owners manual <p> I generally find that manufacturers give very little thought to writing a proper owners manual . - In fact , perhaps some of the worst culprits are manufacturers of SDRs and PC-controlled radios : instead of including a printed , informative , and edited owners manual , they opt for either online discussion boards , or inadequate built-in/online FAQs and help databases . <p> Thankfully , WinRadio bucks this trend ! - I am very impressed with their English owners manual . While the Excalibur and its software are fairly intuitive , the owners manual explains very thoroughly how the Excalibur works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interface and function keys , and how to troubleshoot simple problems . I have learned a lot by simply reading the manual from cover to cover . I hope other receiver manufacturers take a note from WinRadios book , and follow suit . <p> At this price point , it is the least the buyer/user can expect . <p> Excalibur limitations <p> The Excalibur is not perfect , and like all radio receivers , it lacks some capabilities that may actually be deal-breakers for some . <p> Firstly , the Excalibur is a Windows ( XP/Vista/7 ) only device . You can not use the Excalibur with Mac OS X , Linux , or Free BSD operating systems , unless ( as with some Mac OS X devices ) you can run the Excalibur application within a Windows partition . Many other SDRs , noting the RF Space line , can be used with a variety of open-source SDR applications . As the name implies , with WinRadio , you 're stuck with Windows . <p> Also , unlike the Perseus and NetSDR , the Excalibur can not be networked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote desktop application to control the Excalibur , the Excalibur application does not allow for native remote operation . By contrast , the Perseus makes this quite easyyou can even find remote stations via a dedicated server . <p> The lock icon on RX2 indicates that this receiver is locked , however , the frequency is not locked . One touch of the tuning knob , or one click a spectrum window can move the receiver off frequency . <p> This may be a personal preference , but I find the tuning lock function is a bit misleading . It does , effectively , lock a virtual receiver on frequency so that the DDC spectrum swatch ca n't be moved beyond that frequency . - It does not , however , prevent one from accidentally moving the frequency within the virtual receiver . In other words , it does not " lock " the frequency as other receiver locks do . <p> Finally , I wish the Excalibur software would embed UTC time code into recorded DDC-captured spectrum . I got used to this feature while testing the Microtelecom Perseus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back through recorded spectrum , I could see the actual time passing in the spectrum. - When I asked WinRadio about this feature , they did n't  say that this will/could be added to the Excalibur , but they pointed to the fact that their new Excalibur Pros application embeds time code. - Yet I wish they could sneak this feature into a future WR-G31DDC software update ( Are you listening , WinRadio ? ) <p> Summary <p> When I begin a radio review , I keep a checklist of pros and cons as I discover them to remind myself of my initial discoveries . <p> Here 's my list from the WinRadio Excalibur : <p> Pros : <p> Top-class receiver in every- respect " especially at a price point below $1,000 US <p> Superb sensitivity <p> Superb selectivity and adjacent signal rejection <p> Effective , visual notch-filtering <p> Effective pass band control <p> Amazing sync detector with switchable sidebands <p> Highly customizable RF gain and noise blanker ( see con ) <p> Spectrum/waterfall displays are responsive on my 2 year old laptop ( see con ) <p> Graphic user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitively designed , <p> and resizable <p> Three virtual receivers can be used independently within a max 2 MHz spectrum <p> Superior recording functionality <p> From 20 kHz up to 2 MHz of spectrum recording with 21 levels selectable <p> All three virtual receivers can record independently and simultaneously <p> Programmable recording with built-in scheduler <p> Wideband spectrum display shows 0-30 or 0-50 MHz of live spectrum <p> Simple DRM implementation which has been well-reviewed elsewhere <p> Extensive , programmable keyboard shortcuts <p> Direct frequency entry from keyboard number pad <p> Small footprint and sleek design even blends in with home office peripherals <p> Excellent , well-written proper owners manual <p> Courteous and responsive WinRadio customer service <p> Cons : <p> Windows onlynot available on Mac OS X or Linux operating systems <p> WinRadio GUI can not be easily replaced with an open source GUI ( see pro ) <p> When recording spectrum , time code is not embedded in the waterfall display as with the Perseus and other SDRs <p> Not natively networkable ( like the Perseus and RFSpace NET SDR ) <p> RF gain and noise blanker are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature does not lock tuning , it only limits DDC spectrum movement <p> A 2 GHz dual core CPU is the minimum system requirement . - In truth , I 've found that a much faster PC is needed if you want to avoid stuttering in wide ( 1 MHz + ) spectrum playback . Extra RAM will also help <p> Conclusion <p> If you 're in the market for a high-performance software defined Windows-based receiver , I suggest you seriously consider the WinRadio WR-G31DDC Excalibur . <p> It is , quite simply , the best SDR I have used to-date . And if , like me , recording functionality is a high-priority , then the Excalibur is your best choice , hands-down . <p> Ive been using the Excalibur extensively since June 2012 to make recordings of broadcasts , many of which have been posted on the SWLing Post ( check out a few ) . <p> Again , though WinRadio was kind enough to loan me the Excalibur for review on the SWLing Post , I put my money where my mouth is , and purchased- it from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . Though I still love my traditional analog and digital tabletop radios , the Excalibur has proven to be not only an excellent tool , but also a superb receiver . <p> If you are an Excalibur owner , or have any comments/questions , please leave them in the comments section below . <p> Great review .. A few years ago I was bitten by the SDR bug , I believe it will all go that way eventually , especially for RX I was in two minds when I sold my JRC 545 DSP and purchased the Excalibur . I can honestly say the Excalibur is the better Rx ( IMHO ) and have never regretted it . If you want PC control and functions with a receiver a true SDR is the only way to go . ( not one relying on a soundcard for its demodulation ) <p> To " see " the bands , click and tune Recording and decoding with no leads Small footprint Filters ( all DSP ) that most conventional radios can not get close to <p> Radiocoms software also support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , though there are some USB tuner units on the market and you need the PC <p> Ok I still have my ICOM R7000 and R71E set for those non PC moments Would not get rid of them ever , even if I do n't  turn them on very often ! Derek <p> I hear youwith all of the performance I get from the Excalibur , I still crave the traditional radio experience . I offset SDR time with my Hammarlund SP-600 , Hallicrafters SX-24 and ( now ) BC-348-Q . I also have the Alinco DX-R8 at the ready . <p> In truth , in times of power outages , etc. a good basic tabletop receiver is the way to go . When I spent this past summer in an off-grid cabin on Prince Edward Island , I wish I would have brought the Alinco with me . I found that running my laptop in combo with the Excalibur or RadioJet drained my small PV-charged battery system all too quickly . Also , the modified sine wave inverter injected a lot of noise into the receivers . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and performance to spare . Lesson learned ! <p> So , I completely agree , we should never get rid of our R7000s and R71s ! ( Both great receivers , BTW ! ) <p> I will add a few observations . A major tweak is the Audio filter wich is able to apply De-emphasis to the receiving signal making the receiving very pleasant and accurate . Also , a major Pro is the Prebuffer function which allows pre-records base band or audio up to 3 seconds . This is usefull when you SEE a signal and want to have it without missing the start . I tried to use WR-G31DDC with HDSDR and it works altough the native software from WinRadio is much better , in my opinion ! I also read somewhere that there is a dll able to make a G31 to work with the G33 software I tried but my versions are too recent and I got stalled . But the G33 software HAS the timestamp on the base band recording <p> Yep indeed .. Sometimes I also just want some simple flick the switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidenty I sold my Alinco DX R8 and got the two " veterian " ICOMs . They make a great duo . part of me is still hankering after another Alinco .. just beacuse no one seems to be making new quality tabletop receivers these days and that SDR capability <p> Great review and agree with all . I too found the handling of my G33DDC frequency/memory list clumsy and exasperating similar in my experiences with my G303e . However I found a cure ! Well , two in fact , one of which appears to be obsolete but still works . The real good one is " JBs station list " originally designed to be a broadcast band frequency programme but works well on HF . It easily can be updated from EiBi , HFCC and others you get a rolling list of all the frequencies plus the station name AND you can control the G33/303 by a right click on the frequency OR if you change the frequency on the radio to a recognised station it scrolls to the new information magic . You need to download an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . <p> The memory program that seems to be obsolete is " RDBM " by a Victor Fonseca in 2007 but no searches for the programme or the author bring up any results . There is no upload form EiBi but by a bit of experimentation it was easy to deduce how the data was saved there is a manual entry system but the good part is that it will control the G33/G303 and it has a " scan " capability where you can enter a whole lot of frequencies which it listens to for a set time and then steps through . I have saved all the MWARA , Volmet , NZ BC Band , NZ and Aus NDBs as Excel spreadsheets and they all load very well into the programme . It will also read the radio and display the info . I hesitate to put the programme up as a download ( I have the installer ) but I will send it to individuals if requested . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207327 @3907327/ <h> Mikes mini review of the RadioShack Model 2000669 shortwave radio <p> I picked one up today , and overall , Im impressed . It does have complete coverage from 2.5 to 26.1 MHz as advertised , and overall , it has very good sensitivity and adjacent channel rejection for a small portable ( in fact , the best I 've heard from such ) . Sure sounds like some sort of DSP filter is involved . Reception is at least as good as my old Grundig Mini 300 and much , much better than a Degen DE22 . Clipping an external long-wire antenna did not cause overloading ( I was very surprised by this ) . AM BCB reception is actually quite decent : I was able to listen to several distant stations that were only 10 kHz from local ones . Audio is OK but not great , and the case does not stand up stably . I guess you cant expect too much from a $30 radio . No case or earbuds are included . <p> By the way , if you go to a local Radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have two stores near my house ; both had the radio marked as $39.99 instead of the $27.99 online sale price . The guys at the first store said " sorry , we cant change the sticker price . " No sale . So , I went to the other store . When I pointed out the web price to the young women helping me there , she said , " this is n't right " and called her manager over who overrode the store price with the cheaper one . <p> So , who makes this radio ? Good question . The back of the case says " Custom manufactured in China for Radio Shack Corporation . " Maybe Tecsun ? <p> Sounds like this may be a great portable for the glove compartment of a car , or to keep in your backpack/briefcase . <p> Thanks , Mike , and please share any other comments about this radio as you use it . <p> The tuning on SW uses an accelerating scheme the longer you press the button , the faster the tuning steps . The receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any " soft muting " when stepwise tuning . The main limitation of the radio for SWL is the short antenna ( 16 ? ; 40 cm ) . Clipping a wire antenna to the whip really brings in lots of station with decent adjacent channel rejection . <p> What modifications would need to be made to remove the mute during the scan ? I do n't  know if you know what a ghost box is but the end result is for it to scan through the channels at a rapid pace unmuted <p> I went to a RS store this evening to get one of these . The website showed the item in stock ( and it was ) but I got the same story from the clerk : it rang up as $39.99 and he would n't sort out the price . Not happy about that . <p> Unfortunately , the current level of knowledge that RS employees have about their products and ( apparently ) business procedures is highly variable . Gone are the days when the manager was probably a ham and the rest of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better price is just order from their website . <p> Out of stock onlineonly certain stores had it . I complained to RS on Twitter , but had no confirmation they did anything about the problem at the original location . The other location in town that had these was able to do the right thing this evening . Tomorrow I 'll check it out . <p> I just bought one tonight during the Thanksgiving rush . Everyone there were buying pretty expensive phones and gadgets while I rolled up to the counter with this little radio marked 39.99 . I asked if they honored their website prices and after going in the back to talk to someone , I was told they would . <p> It really does well with a little wire attached to it . The volume seems very low on SW compared to AM/FM . <p> After reading the comments about the web sale price being obtained in-store I visited 3 Radio Shack stores only to be turned away with excuses why they would n't " price match " . So I ordered one on Cyber Monday with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale price . ( I was going to have it shipped to one of the 3 stores I 'd visited just to spite them ; but hey , why waste the gas again ) . <p> Anyway , if you 're thinking of running out to buy one of these instead of the competition do n't  . This radio does n't  hold a candle to similarly-sized and featured Tecsun DSP radios like the PL-505 and PL-606 . <p> On FM its quite sensitive and selective ; but MW/SW are another matter . It receives the local powerhouses just fine , but I had a $6 Wal-Mart transistor radio that did that adequately too . <p> The main problem seems to be lack of any detectable AGC action , resulting in inadequate volume ( even in headphones ) on anything besides the locals . Sorta like the first production run of the CC Pocket radio but , to their credit , they did fix that . I cant even tell whether the DSP chip is programmed to enforce " soft mute " because EVERYTHING is already muted . <p> It also does funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other radio it sounds like white noise that grows weaker the further you de-tune . On this radio its just a kind of silent de-sense which extends 20 or 30 KHz in either direction . <p> SW reception is marginal because the telescopic whip is way too short ; I have n't tried connecting a long wire yet but do n't  have high hopes . Lots of MW images on SW too . <p> Wow , Mikethanks for the comments on performance . In the end , I 'm glad you got a better deal on Cyber Monday . Sad that RS cant match their own online prices . I wonder how much longer theyll last after this holiday season . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207328 @3907328/ <h> Tag Archives : Shortwave Radio Recordings <p> Ok , so officially it was n't a DXpedition ; it was a well needed vacation in the sun after several hectic months of work , some of which involved travel to slightly more exotic locations . However , these days , I view any travel , whether it be for business or pleasure as a DXpedition opportunity ! Some of you might remember that I purchased a Bonito Boni Whip at the beginning of 2017 because ( a ) I needed another antenna and ( b ) a second Wellbrook loop felt like too much of an extravagance . Theyre excellent antennas for sure , but at around -300 , I could n't justify buying another . Thus , for about a third of the price I bought the Boni Whip . It proved to be an excellent choice very compact and so perfect for my regular DXpeditions , quick to set up and capable of really excellent DX . There are many videos on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel that are testament to this . I wrote a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by Dennis Walter of Bonito , who subsequently contacted me and offered to send over their MegActive MA305 E-field antenna for testing . Dennis made it crystal-clear that I was to do my own thingtest the antenna in any way I saw fit and publish my findings so DXers/radio enthusiasts could learn more about the capabilities of the antenna from another DXer . I was happy to agree to this arrangement and the MegActive MA305 duly arrived , complete with two lengths of ( bayonet BNC terminated ) high quality H-155 coaxial cable . <p> The specifications of the MegActive MA305 are very similar to the Boni Whip ; they both offer a Gain of +3 dBs , second and third order intercept points of greater than +30 and +50 dB respectively and both tune to 300 MHz . The MA305 is supplied with a longer radiating element and tunes down to 9 KHz ( versus the 20 kHz lower limit for the Boni Whip ) . Obviously this is n't a specification that is going to concern most radio enthusiasts ; both offer fantastically wide operating bandwidths . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is in how they are powered . The Boni Whip operates from 12 to 15 V , whilst the MA305 operates from 5 to 15 V. Bonitos design philosophy regarding this feature is based on- the increasing difficulty in procuring reasonably priced analogue external plug-in power supplies ( they are no longer allowed to be produced due to power consumption restrictions ) . <p> Interestingly , when the power supply for my Wellbrook ALA1530 packed up , I called them to purchase a replacement and was told they only have limited stocks remaining . Thus , a solution for powering active antennas with a suitable low-noise supply is an issue that needs resolving . The guys at Bonito figured a USB power source was suitably quiet and with USB power bricks almost ubiquitous these days for charging mobile phones and other portable electronic devices on-the-go , the idea could be applied to their active antennas . The result is the MegActive MA305 , designed to operate at 5 Volts with no loss of performance . As a DXer who probably spends more time listening on DXpeditions than I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfect . I myself often carry a cheap Chromebook laptop to use as an additional power source for my camera phone when Im DXing , so Bonitos design approach resonated with me completely . <p> - <h> Travelling with the MegActive MA305 <p> Ok , so the MA305 is very compact and very light indeed perfect for a trip to Crete ! However , I know from many conversations with my YouTube friends and followers that some of us feel a slight sense of trepidation carrying shortwave radios and antenna systems on board flights , be they national or international . I myself was n't really concerned other than if my bag got pulled from the X-ray machine , there 's often quite a long wait whilst the security staff work through the queue of luggage requiring erhuman intervention ! Predictably , my rucksack did get pulled and I waited patiently until it was my turn to explain the contents ! Looking back on this retrospectively , its hardly surprising . Other than the usual holiday paraphernalia , my rucksack contained : <p> A 10.0 metre length of H-155 coaxial cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eton Satellit receiver <p> MA305 Coaxial Power Inserter <p> MA305 Antenna Amplifier <p> Bonito USB Power Brick <p> Bonito USB Power Cable <p> NooElec RTL-SDR dongle <p> NooElect Ham It Up upconverter <p> Various screened cables and connectors <p> 10 metres of equipment wire <p> I explained to the ( friendly ) security chap that I was a shortwave radio hobbyist and identified the various pieces of equipment for him , as he removed them from my rucksack . He confirmed my X-ray had lit up ( in blue as it happens ) with metallic/electronic items and was even kind enough to swivel his monitor to show me the mess of items strewn across the screen just as I had thrown them all into my rucksack ! However , after quickly swabbing some of the items , he said all was fine and hoped that I enjoyed my holiday and listening . Service with a smile at Gatwick Airport and I was on my way . My outbound experience got me thinking whether it would be possible to pack my DXing kit in such a way that it would n't alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I packed all of my cables into my ( checked-in ) suitcase . I figured it would be obvious there was no security risk associated with cables alone . I then packed my RTL-SDR , upconverter and all of the MS305 components very neatly into a single box and put that in my carry-on rucksack . Now , some might argue that security measures at Heraklion International Airport in Crete differ a little from London Gatwick , but I observed staff at the X-ray machine very carefully monitoring every piece of luggage passing through it including my own and I passed straight through without a problem . All I did was take my laptop out as usual , and put it in a separate tray . Job done . <h> DXing with the MegActive MA305 <p> My apartment in Crete was on the second floor and a large balcony provided a decent outdoor location for DXing . As regards electrical noise , the location was much quieter than my shack at home , but it certainly was n't perfect , thus a good test of the MA305 in a real-world pseudo-urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a cheap Selfie Stick and some tape and managed to construct a mount for the amplifier , increasing the overall height above ground by about 1.5 metres and displacing the radiating element an additional 2 metres thereabouts from the building . I 'm not sure whether it made much difference , but it seemed like the sensible thing to do for less than 10 Euros . <p> Despite hearing a lot of excellent DX whilst in Crete , there is one signal I copied , which more than any other , demonstrates the DXing credentials of the MA305 and Eton Satellit for that matter . In the early hours of the morning ( 00:59 hrs UTC ) I copied and recorded Radio Tarma from Peru on 4775 kHz . With a TX power of 1 kW , this is a very difficult station to hear in Western Europe , even with a longwire . To catch this station in Crete , at all , was incredible on an ultra-compact set-up . It was at this point during the trip that I realised E-field antennas really do work superbly well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct further tests back home in the Oxfordshire countryside , where electrical noise is absent . This I did a few days ago , with some quite amazing results on the Tropical Band . More on that to come in my next post . In the meantime , please find text links and embedded videos for selected reception recordings , below . Many more recordings are available on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel and please do n't  hesitate to contact me if you require further information on the MA305 or the Eton Satellit . Thanks for **26;457;TOOLONG and I wish you all excellent DX . <h> Other notable catches 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Hi there , I posted an article on this brilliant little radio a few months ago because- it had demonstrated a level of performance way beyond my expectations . Notwithstanding its incredibly small size the DX results I obtained with it were beyond my ICF-SW55 and up there with the iconic ICF-2001D . Armed with- synchronous detection , selectable side bands , SSB , CW and sensitivity seemingly boyond- its tiny form factor I cant recommend this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market in 1993 and discontinued in 2005 , the ICF-SW100 wont ever be repeated a point I made in my original post , but of course they are available on eBay and prices remain robust for what is now essentially a vintage receiver . Unfortunately , I do n't  get to use my ICF-SW100 very much as I have various other receivers and have been involved in antenna building/testing and MW DX for the past few months . However , on the couple of- occasions when I have taken the Sony on a mini DXpedition , its resulted in some fine DX . As demonstrated in the examples below , Mali , Guinea , Alaska and Japan are amongst the more difficult signals to copy in Europe and yet the ICF-SW100 delivered them ! Text links to reception videos on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel follow below and futher down you will find embedded videos . Thanks for **26;485;TOOLONG and I wish you all great DX ! 42385 @qwx662385 <p> One of the things I now regret is that I did n't  make more recordings of radio stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have very few audio examples of stations operating at that time . So disappointing ! <p> However.a few weeks- ago , I stumbled across a recording I made in December 1973 of Radyo Pilipinas , The Voice of the Philippines ( DZRP ) . - After a bit of audio engineering on the deteriorating old cassette tape , I 've managed to somewhat improve the tone quality . I also found an image of the QSL card from that exact transmission on December 11 , 1973 on 9580 kHz . I 've posted the recording on YouTube click the embedded video below . <p> This is for those of you who can remember and for those who enjoy some radio history ! <p> These days , Radyo Pilipinas still has a small presence on the shortwave bands with the following schedule : <p> To the Middle East in English and Tagalog from the Tinang relay site ( 250 kW ) 0200-0330 on 15640 , 17700 and 17820 kHz 1730-1930 on 9925 , 12120 and 15190 kHz <p> 73 and have a great weekend everyone ! <p> Rob Wagner VK3BVW <p> Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a regular- contributor to the SWLing Post . He- also blogs at the Mount Evelyn DX Report . <p> Hi there , further to my previous post regarding the initial testing of the Medium Wave Circle-design 200 metre Beverage antenna at the woods in Oxford , UK , I am pleased to share further reception videos for both the medium wave and shortwave bands . For medium wave , I operated the FDM DUO via a laptop and the FDN-SW2 software , recorded the entire band at the top of the hour and retrospectiively analysed the signals . For shortwave I utillised the FDM DUO as a standalone receiver , routing the audio via the excellent Bose Soundlink Mini 2 speaker . <p> As a quick recap , the antenna was terminated at the front end with a 650 Ohm resistor into a 1 metre-long , permanent copper earthing rod that I had previously driven into the ground , away from the route taken by the general public .

A scematic diagram follows below . <p> The reception from VOCM St. Johns , Newfoundland &amp; Labrador and WRCA Waltham , Massachusetts was unprecidented and another indication that the 200 metre Beverage configuration is demonstrating excellent SNR performance .

Finally , the signal received from Radio Huanta 2000 one of the more- exotic stations on the Tropical Band and rarely heard in Europe delivered- discernible audio with this set-up , whereas previously I had only ever observed a- carrier .

@@75207329 @3907329/ <h> A review of the Sony SRF-59 cheap , fun Mediumwave DX thrills <p> A few years ago , I heard a lot of buzz in AM/Mediumwave radio circles about a small , inexpensive radio called the Sony SRF-59 . Discussions were focused on the incredible performance of this diminutive low-cost radio and how it held it own against some real benchmark receivers . Out of curiosity , I did a search on the radio to see what it looked likeI expected some Tecsun PL-like unitand found that , much to my surprise , its a simple , analog , totally unassuming AM/FM walkman . - Say , what ? <p> The far biggest surprise came with my price search , however . The SRF-59 is easy to find at $14.95 US . Really , you ask ? Oh , yesand its readily available at many online and big box stores . <p> The radio came in a basic plastic blister pack , and it also included headphones . I cant comment on the headphones as I did n't  even bother unpacking them ; instead , I plugged my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to admit , the AM band on this little radio does indeed shine . Not only is the receiver sensitive and relatively selective ( meaning , I do n't  hear adjacent signals when tuned in ) , but it also has excellent audio . - Amazingly , it lives up to all of the praise I had heard about it . I 'm quite amazed , in fact , at how well this little unit can null out stations by rotating the radio body a few degrees . Most impressive . <p> Though I 'm no major FM radio listener , I can also vouch for its FM performance , which is quite good . <p> because tuning is analog , it works in North America just as well as in Japan ( see cons ) <p> Cons : <p> tuning is analog , thus no stations can be saved to memory and there is a noticeable amount of receiver drift if listening over long periods of time <p> no fine-tuning mechanism means that tuning in weak stations takes precision skill on the SRF-59s very small dial <p> no built-in speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summary , you will regret not purchasing this radio should Sony pull it from the market without warning . While it is a walkman with the above listed limitations , its nonetheless a first-rate AM/MW receiver and might be a great avenue into the fun hobby of ultralight DXing . <p> In short , the Sony SRF-59 is a real gem . But do n't  take my word for it , eithergo check one out for yourself ! <p> I agree 100 percent as to the amazing MW performance of this little gem ! I could n't believe it when I first fired it up . The price is almost too low to believe as mine cost $ 12.95 with 3 bucks shipping .

@@75207334 @3907334/ <h> Tom notes decrease in price of Grundig Satellit 750 on Amazon <p> Grundig/Eton radios are going back down in price . This is n't the lowest price I have seen for the Grundig Satellit 750 , but now is a good time to get this model if you do n't  have it as that is not a bad price ! <p> Oh ! oh ! is this a precursor to it being discontinued ? prices tend to drop like this prior to the model discontinuation . This is the gold standard for currently available shortwave receivers . I would like to see a comparative review to a Tecsun . <p> I owned one briefly 6 years ago . It was a good radio , but not great . The AM was not as strong as my Sangean PR-D5 in spite of the external antenna . It took a while to learn how to use . It took up a lot of table space . I liked it though because it looked cool , but after it lost in an AM comparison to my 60 dollar Sangean PR-D5 I sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a DSP chip for stronger FM . <p> There was a rep from Eton who presented at the Winter SWL Fest a number of years ago . It was as the Satellit 800 was being discontinued and the 750 was being brought to market . By his own admission , the performance of the 750 would not match the 800 . Many may remember that the 800 was brought to market with design help from Drake . That said , I never purchased a 750 and still own my 800 . <p> ive had a 750 for several years now , and ive always been impressed with the performance on SW given the price . in its initial few years there were serious QA issues where one unit would perform well and another would be deaf on SW . MW performance is less than brilliant , though , with typically very poor S/N ratios on weak-ish signals . <p> i just hope tecsun replaces it with something even better . there really are n't  many good normal receivers in that price range with that level of performance . IMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom , you certainly snagged the 750 as a bargain at $243 ! <p> That 's interesting to note about the 800 and 750 comparisons , Dan . <p> And thanks for the note about HRO carrying the 750 for $299 with free shippingquite honestly , I keep forgetting HRO stocks shortwave radios , Ken ! They should sponsor us here on the SWLing Postput in a good word , will ya ! ? ! ! = <p> I like supporting retailers like HRO , Universal , ML&amp;S , Durham , proper radio retailers . <p> I 've never bothered purchasing or reviewing the 750 mainly because its an " in between " radio for me . Not super portable , yet not fully a tabletop . It is at a decent price point for someone who wants the features of a tabletop ( proper encoder , etc. ) without paying a tabletop price . My shack space is limited , so radios have to be benchmark in performance to displace something else . <p> My comment regards marketing and selling practices of Amazon . As I write this comment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars . Closer examination of the page shows that these ratings are a combined rating for five different Eton " Grundig " radios sold on the same page . If each customer review is looked at individually the radio model number is listed under the " color " entry . Star ratings for the 750 at Amazon seem to be lower than 4 stars . Pricing at Amazon is determined by an algorithm designed to yield the highest profit over a selected time interval . Prices will change on a weekly or daily basis . Sometimes Amazon prices will actually be lower for the same item sold by the same seller on eBay , but not often . What does this mean ? Who knows . Amazon prices for the Sangean ATS-909X have risen since the weeks before Christmas . Amazon prices for prices for the Tecsun PL880 rose after Christmas and fell again . <p> You bring up a good point about Amazon reviews in general . Quite often , you 'll see " combined " reviews for various products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " star " value . <p> What 's worse , though , is there 's a whole cottage industry based on Amazon reviews . Companies ( not Amazon proper ) directly pay people to either create fake positive reviews or they reimburse them for purchases to appear " verified " and they create a positive review . <p> Its actually pretty easy to spot the shills . Especially when something has a 5 star rating with only a handful of reviews and each review lacks any sort of substance . <p> You got that rightI made a few cursory remarks about the Sangean DT-160 having soft mute and got my head handed to me on a platter . Comments on a book were even worse , the guy was frantic in his desire to be right . IIRC Amazon gives free points or something now so they can get free stuff for " correct " reviews so watch out , take those " reviews " with a large grain of salt and do n't  comment whatever you do . As for the 750 , see the Eham.com reviews . Basically a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the usual Tecsun lack of QC , freq. off on FM , etc . A good portable like the 7600GR does as well and is more " handy " the 750 is essentially a portable in a big box with a super-thin speaker grill ( at least that one was ) . Only thing " impressive " is the size . <p> I agree that prices on Amazon vary all over the place . Just yesterday they had a etching printer for $25 off the already low price but the sale only lasted for a few hours . I use a website called CamelCamel to track prices especially for Amazon . You set a price you want to pay and when the price falls below that it will send you an email notice . It will also give you a graph of prices of an item over the past few years .

As well as providing SDRuno SDR software , support for popular 3rd party packages like HDSDR , SDR-Console and Cubic SDR is provided . Recent availability of an SD Card image makes for easy set up on a Raspberry Pi . <p> Ive been fascinated with radio astronomy since my university days . In the 1980s and 90s almost any radio astronomy experiment equated to forking out some serious money to purchase a wideband receiver ( serious money to a student , at least ) . With the advent of SDRs , though , radio astronomy has become affordable for everyone . <p> Over on YouTube user- MaskitolSAE- has uploaded a video showing him receiving some noise bursts from Jupiter with his SDRplay RSP1 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural radio lasers ' powered partly by the planets interaction with the electrically conductive gases emitted by Io , one of the the planets- moons . When Jupiter is high in the sky and the Earth passes through one of these radio lasers the noise bursts can be received on Earth- quite easily with an appropriate antenna <p> In his video- MaskitolSAE- shows the 10 MHz of waterfall and- audio from some Jupiter noise bursts received with his SDRplay RSP1 at 22119 kHz . According to the YouTube description , it appears that he is using the UTR-2 radio telescope- which is a large Ukrainian radio telescope installation that consists of an array of 2040 dipoles . A professional radio telescope installation is not required to receive the Jupiter bursts ( a backyard dipole tuned to 20 MHz will work ) , but the professional radio telescope does get some really nice strong bursts as seen in the video . <p> As Carl mentions above , you do not need a professional radio telescope to receive Jupiter noise bursts , a dipole will do . <p> In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter receivera simple SDR kit called the Radio JOVE Receiver which is promoted by NASA . While PARI has the resources to install any number of antennas , PARI uses two simple dipoles which are mounted only a few feet off the ground as their radio telescope .

It works brilliantly . <p> The Radio JOVE receiver at PARI <p> I had planned to purchase and build a JOVE receiver ( and , for fun , still may ! ) , but it would be much easier to simply use the SDRplay RSP I already have in my shack .

It was 769 until I sent my modest click across the universe L. <p> On the domestic front we 've seen the pointy-headed bean counters in Canberra and their political masters take the knife to our national broadcaster to the point where Radio Australia now seems to be little more than a relay station for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With all this doom and gloom it was with some trepidation that I spied a recent Australian Government report entitled Digital Radio Report1 which arrived via my email in-box through the excellent Australian Policy On-line resource. - The report was published in July 2015 by the Department of Communications and was conducted by the Minister for Communications under the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act . Note : the Minister for Communications then was Malcolm Turnbull who is now Australia 's Prime Minister . <p> The report makes for an interesting read ( for nerds like us ) and provides some great insight into the bureaucracy 's thinking on the future of radio broadcasting in this country. - So while the report ostensibly considers the current and potential state of digital radio in Australia , in so doing it looks at the other forms of radio broadcasting and gives us a peek into the future . <p> The report broadly considers the following issues : <p> The current state of digital broadcasting and alternative forms , eg streaming services through the interwebs <p> Whether Australia should set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <p> The legal and regulatory framework for digital services . <p> Like you would have dear reader I quickly scrolled through the report to see if it was recommending a full switchover to digital. - The good news is that this wo n't happen anytime soon and perhaps not ever. - Phew ! It seems Australia 's geography and sparse population works in our favour ( for once ) . - Anyway , more on that later . <p> So what does the Australian radio broadcasting landscape look like at present ? - Well for lovers of analogue radio it 's still looking pretty strong and it 's likely to remain that way for some time to come. - In the five big cities the 2014 average weekly audience for commercial radio services grew by 4.13 per cent to 10.1 million people. - That 's pretty impressive given the quality of the stuff they serve up each day. - Aunty 's ( that 's the ABC to foreign folk ) radio service reached a record 4.7 million people in 13/14 , an increase of 155,000 listeners on the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 273 analogue commercial radio services ( 104 on AM , 152 FM and 12 outside the broadcasting service bands. - Community radio is going strong with 357 analogue services ( 13 AM and 344 FM ) plus 244 narrowcasters ( 33 AM and 211 FM ) . - There 's lots of stuff still out there it seems. - Perhaps too much as the FM band is becoming very crowded in the major metropolitan areas . <p> There are 142 commercial digital services in the big capitals plus the two trial sites in Canberra and Darwin. - Interestingly a good proportion of the digital services are simulcast analogue services , for example 11 out 29 of the commercial digitals in Sydney. - Listenership of digital radio is growing slowly and steadily , reaching 25 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 , primarily due to the growth of receivers in motor vehicles . <p> Streaming services are rapidly gaining ground with services like Spotify , Pandora and the new Apple Music picking up new subscribers each week. - The move by Aunty and the Special Broadcasting Service 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also showing good growth . It would appear that to some extent this growth has been at the expense of terrestrial digital services , but audience data in this area is pretty sketchy it seems . <p> So what of the future for digital radio ?

And while some European countries such as Norway with near total digital coverage are looking to switch off their FM services , some countries such as the UK have postponed their planned switchover to digital due to slow uptake by the listening public . <p> In Australia there are big interests such as SBS , Commercial Radio Australia and Broadcast Australia pushing for a switchover to digital as soon as possible. - - Thankfully the report 's authors have listened to other bodies that advocate for a multi technology approach. - Significantly the report notes that while digital could match FM for coverage with a similar number of transmitters , it will struggle to match the coverage provided by the medium and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital Radio Mondiale and satellite digital radio technologies could increase digital 's coverage but are not considered viable . <p> Internet based services are not seen as a realistic alternative in the medium term due to high data costs , restricted wifi coverage , likely interruptions in high traffic areas and poor battery life on mobiles. - It 's likely that this will be a niche medium for some time . <p> So what does the report conclude and recommend ? - Well , digital radio was only ever introduced as a complimentary technology and that will continue to be the case. - In saying that the report makes a series of recommendations to free up the rules so broadcasters can take up the digital option more readily. - DAB+ is the preferred technology so do n't go ordering a DRM set anytime soon . <p> Perhaps most interestingly , the report makes a major finding that there may be an opportunity to consider how analogue terrestrial radio coverage can be improved pending the roll out of digital radio. - This includes further research into how AM coverage can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made available in regional areas for new analogue services or switching existing AM services over to FM , potentially in lieu of the rollout of digital services. - For us lovers of analogue radio this is certainly good news , particularly if more high powered AM broadcasters hit the band . <p> Does this actually mean that analogue radio services are safe ? - Well , governments have been very good at ignoring reports advocating for the public good and succumbing to the commercial interests with other agendas , particularly when it comes to media. - That said , it does n't make a lot of sense for the government to pull the plug on analogue anytime soon given the coverage issues in regional Australia. - However , when it comes to governments , the sensible thing to do is often viewed as the last option . <p> Yeah , Kris , DRM certainly has possibilities . It was sadly a case of " the cart before the horse " though . If someone wouldve developed an effective , inexpensive DRM receiver by 2005 , I 'm sure it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers were not , though . <p> If you 've done much driving in the outback , you 'll notice AM really is the backbone of radio out there .

Pity there 's not really any commercial digital radio mondial , because the lower frequencies of MW really to carry better . DAB+ is fine in the inner city , but it does n't  actually give the listener many improvements . Tiny battery life for what , scrolling song titles ?

@@75207346 @3907346/ <h> A review of the Kchibo KK-9803 shortwave radio <p> Admittedly , my expectations were quite low when I ordered the re-engineered Kchibo KK-9803 for a mere $14.90 from a seller on eBay . It is , without a doubt , the least expensive portable shortwave receiver Ive ever purchased new. - Now I know why . <p> Indeed , I found it hard to believe that this was actually a DSP radio , and even asked the seller to confirm this in advance of purchase . Part of my doubt arose from the fact that the Kchibo KK-9803 has been on the market for a few years as a no-frills analog radio . At some point this year , Kchibo " enhanced " this model with a DSP chip , to be much like the recently reviewed Degen DE321 . <p> I purchased the Kchibo KK-9803 on a whim . Could this cheap radio offer enhanced performance with its new DSP-enhanced engineering ? The short answer : No . <p> You pay for what you get <p> I was completely- underwhelmed- by the Kchibo KK9803 . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implementation of the DSP chip in this unit is , unfortunately , poor . <p> My primary criticism is that the shortwave band segments are much too close to one another on the dialhence , when tuning , the digital tuning steps ( perhaps 5 kHz ? ) are too narrowly-spaced to offer any sort of tuning accuracy . Barely moving the tuning wheel , one may pass over even a strong station- undetectably . The only hint of the stations existence may be a quick blip or audio buzz . <p> I must confess that the experience of band-scanning ( tuning ) this radio offers is the worst I 've ever known . One basically can not tune and " hear " station presence like one would on practically any other radio product . While comparing this radio to the Degen DE321 and Tecsun PL-380 ( two other DSP portables I had on hand ) , I had difficulty locating even benchmark stations like China Radio International , Voice of Greece , RCI , and others ; in fact , I could n't even tune in Voice of Greece on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped off of the KK-9803s dial . Tuning across the band produces a very strange choppy sound , mostly void of the typical sounds you hear as you tune past stations while band-scanning on most other radios . <p> I did manage to tune in a few stations with considerable effort. - How one finds a strong station at all is by locating the spots on the band where sound is dead , and then meticulously fine-tuning around these areas . I use the phrase " fine-tuning " quite loosely , as there is no actual fine-tuning wheelby this , I mean making the slightest possible movements of the tuning wheel and just hoping for the best. - This demands great fine-motor skillsbut even greater patience . <p> Perhaps more annoying , once you actually manage to lock in a station , within the next five seconds the DSP chipset increases the volume in three overly-dramatic stepsfrom soft , to medium , to OUCH. - Tuning this radio requires not only patience , but if using good earphones , instant readiness to adjust the volume for fear of its increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive points about this radio was a challenge : <p> Pros : <p> Inexpensive ( see con ) <p> Plastic body is fairly durable <p> FM performance acceptable ( see cons ) <p> The KK-9803 's band selection slider switch is loose and sloppy . <p> Cons : <p> Cheap ( see pro ) <p> Shortwave performance is dismal and DSP-lock unreliable <p> Shortwave bands are chopped up into too-small segmentsactive portions of the 41M and 31M bands , for example , are altogether missing <p> One more positive : The back stand feels pretty durable--it 's even designed to be shock-absorbing . Too bad the radio does n't perform as well as its back stand . <p> If you really want a DSP radio with an analog face , spend an extra $6 and purchase the Degen DE321 , or wait for the Tecsun R-2010 to be released . The only benefit I see to the Kchibo KK-9803 is its FM performance , which is acceptable . But if its only FM you 're looking for , my advice is to purchase a better-quality , comparably-priced radio like the Sony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM ( mediumwave ) performance as well . <p> The Kchibo KK-9803 is a radio that should have remained in the all-analog realm ; I imagine its performance in that form was more reliable and tuning much easier . Adding the DSP chip to this radio was an unfortunate upgradereally , a downgrade , in my opinion. - In conclusion : do yourself a favor and use the $14.90 to buy- rechargeable- batteries or anything else besides the Kchibo KK-9803 . <p> I 'm not sure what is available locally in India . I can tell you that you typically need to spend between Rs. 1900-3100 to get a decent basic portableyou can find many of these on eBay . Check out the Tecsun R-911 or , even better , the Tecsun PL-380 . <p> I have both the kchibo , kaito wrx911 , degen 321 , in terms of reception sensitivity the kchibo kk9803 out perform the kaito and degen . I 'm just wondering why , before purchasing the kaito and degen I tried first to read the review both the kaito and degen , Im disappointed . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

I have n't used it , but I 've been researching the same issue for something to use cleaning up a GE P780 and the face plate of a Kenwood R-1000 . I tried a little Simichrome polish on the R-1000 but stopped after seeing ( what I thought was ) too much color on the rag . Another thought is toothpaste . Itll be interesting to see what others have to say . Good luck with your project ! <p> Warm water with soup is very good for knobs and chassis and other things that you can easily open and take apart . Do n't  forget Ethanol too ( for cleaning dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also read this very good post : LONG ... I also recently opened my old devices ( a signal generator and a frequency meter ) and washed them = After washing plastic parts , let them dry ( do n't  expose plastic parts to very hot air for drying . ) As others have said , soft tissues and soft brush is also necessary . <p> The Armour All works fine . I prefer the nonglossy , as it is glossy enough ! <p> For the clear plastic over the dials , what I have found takes out the scratches like magic is a fine cloth , and.Cigarette ashes ! Get some cigarette ashes from a smoker friend . Or just buy some and let them burn down . But its easier to find a smoker friend to help you with this . And you do n't  want any tobacco or filtre remnants , JUST cigarette ashes . Gently rub them on the clear plastic , dry . It takes the scratches right out ! It works on watch dials , too . <p> Lock Ease ( brand ) works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that silicone stuff on the antenna whipsit ends up INSULATING the individual elements and you do n't  want that to happen ! <p> Do n't  use acetone , denatured alcohol on cabinets , I would use armor-all on vinyl straps . For plastic , I use the same stuff used for cleaning up fogged plastic headlight lenses on cars . You can get it in auto parts stores . What I generally do is disassemble the whole radio and wash the plastic cabinet in warm water and dish washing liquid . Some times the plastic posts the pcb are mounted on may be cracked/stripped. fill them with epoxy and re drill and thread with the screws . If whole sections are missing sometimes you can make a mold with tape and replicate by filling in with epoxy or bondo . If you are ambitious , you can clean off the flux on the pcb then spray with clear krylon once you know it works <p> Yes I disassemble a whole radio aswell.The older type I find are alot easier to do that than the newer ones that are have everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a diagram of where everything goes back.Then the cleaning starts to get all the dust and grim that 's built up over the years out of it.I soak the plastic chassis or case in warm soapy water to soften anything , then useing an old tooth brush scrub it all.Knobs and switch levers the same.I do n't  get any mosture on the circuit boards.I then use clean small paint brushes and a small hand held vacuum cleaner to suck and clean the boards as best as I can , then once everything is dry , I reassemble.As far as marks and scratches go , yes I would agree that cigarette ash would be the best.But with the radio showing a few scratches , it shows that its had a life somewhere , so I would n't be too much of a perfectionist as it adds to its mileage , just like an old car showing its age and wear and tear.But I have a passion for these old ones.Sometimes there 's only so much you can do depending on its condition.Some I 've found even in rubbish tips have been really abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair and its a real shame , as you just do n't  see them again.Anyway have lots of fun and satisfaction ! ! <p> I actually cleaned up a similar model , the 5500M ( which has SW rather than public service band ) . I just took off the case , nobs , switches and gave them a bath with liquid laundry detergent ( they have brand names like fluffy or softly ) . This detergent will lift off the dust &amp; grime without the need for scrubbing . One word of caution , do n't  use hot water , only lukewarm , otherwise it may change/fade the colour of the plastic ! <p> Nice find on the 5500 ! Ive come to swear by Mothers Back-to-Black from the auto store for restoring the finish to older transistor sets . It seems to last longer then Armour All , and despite its name works fine on the clear plastic too . Knobs that have accumulated finger grime I remove and let soak in water and Dawn , then use a toothbrush to reach into ridged areas , dry well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a set clean , I fashion a clear plastic cover out of document protectors to stop the accumulation of household dust , which can be a hassle with some radios with lots of buttons like the ICF-2010 . <p> Some very good suggestions here . I have also done cosmetic restoration on plastics found on a number of products from vintage wooden boats to boat anchor radios and portable radios . Meguiars PlastX is good for restoring gloss and clarity to dulled , damaged plastics . <p> Another auto product is my go-to cleaner and protectant for all plastics : Blue Coral High Foam Car Wash Concentrate is my favorite for the boat and cars but I have used it for many years to detail plastic radios and other equipment . Use it at half the automotive paint strength for plastics of all kind . It will bead surface water . It leaves a natural gloss , not overglossy or slippery like Armor All . Safe for all plastics , glass , metals and paints . Good for maintaining new radios , too . Use only 100% cotton rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for reaching nooks and crannies on radio exteriors . So are small natural ( usually pig ) bristle paint brushes . Synthetic cloth can damage plastics . If you have paint splatters on the radio these can be removed carefully by mechanical means , especially if it is latex house paint . Oil based enamels may be a more stubborn matter . <p> This brings back many memories the Captain 55 was only my second shortwave radio ( paid for from earnings from my first job ) , and I remember too that the audio was very good on this set . The UK version was sold with shortwave coverage from the 120mb down to the 25mb , though missing out on the 19mb . <p> What a beautiful radio , congratulations on getting this nice example of a 70s era radio .

Just last night amidst the Rocky Mountains , I was listening to a very nice musical program from New Zealands state broadcaster , RNZI , via DRM . Thankfully , music is hard to propagandize so hopefully commercial broadcasters will assume the role of RNZI and other state broadcasters as the latter die . Ahhhh , music under the stars , a class act indeed ! <p> TP Reitzel you have no idea what your talking about . Please find me one piece of propaganda in any of the VOA feature programs ? The only part of VOAs broadcasts that can be considered propaganda is the last 2 to 3 minutes where they say " And now an editorial expression the views of the United States Government . I seriously doubt you ever have or almost never listen to the VOA and do n't  even know there programs . Myself I listen to the VOA daily for Daybreak Asia and Crossroads Asia , Border Crossings and Jazz America . And also recently started listening to China Focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a state broadcaster . The definition between public and state broadcaster is worlds apart . <p> There is a clear difference and both are not the same . State broadcasters are just that . State . Their editorial policy depends on who the president is . Public broadcasters operate at arms length from the government . <p> You very well know that public broadcasters are a corporation funded in part by the state . Regardless of the alleged " independence " of the boards controlling them , these public broadcasters are still partly beholden to the state for their existence . The critical listener can easily discern the state propaganda spewing forth from the BBC , RNZI , VOA , etc. just by listening . I suspect indoctrinated listeners would have difficulty discerning such propaganda , though , due to their . indoctrination . As a critical listener , I can easily cite the drum of propaganda since the content constantly falls along predictable lines , e.g. global warming , homosexuality , womans rights , etc . If you ca n't spot the propaganda from these state broadcasters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasters ( including the partly funded " public " broadcasters ) is totally predictable just like the content from NPR . <p> " Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism , because it is a merger of state and corporate power . " Mussolini <p> I 'm sorry TP you really have no idea what your talking about . Your just coming across as a conspiracy nut . What your saying has more holes than Swiss cheese . I would really like to know how often you listen to public and state broadcasters to come to that conclusion . Again I suspect your just some conspiracy loon who like all of them lke talking out of their hats . <p> Keith , you really should try to stick with the facts instead of jumping to irrational conclusions about the remarks of others . Maybe , some readers might enjoy your baseless ad hominem attacks instead of coherent replies , though . <p> My previous remarks are accurate and still stand . Any critical listener can easily identify the propaganda spewing forth from state , yes STATE , broadcasters like the VOA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith is quite correct to point out the difference between what are true state broadcasters , and VOA and other stations . What has to be noted here , however , is the quite shocking number of people in the United States who feel that the expense for VOA and other BBG channels , is no longer justified , based not only on misinformation they have had about what the stations do , but also simply on grounds of mismanagement and inefficiency in government . <p> You know Dan what I find funny is people in the US like in most countries have no idea what the external service does . Not only does it bring news and information to people who do n't  have it . But also more importantly its a vital tool for soft diplomacy . But the problem dan is most people have no idea what it is and the benefits it brings to a country in terms for foreign investment and the promotion of products for export . <p> VOA spent many years ignoring Americans IN the US . In fact , as I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any role at all in domestic broadcasting . That sort of thing certainly does n't  help people in this country understand what the VOA does . I 'm sure most Americans have no idea it even exists . <p> Having spent many years as a VOA Foreign Service Officer and radio engineer , I can personally attest to the effectiveness of shortwave broadcasting and its ability to reach oppressed people around the world . The " new " technologies like the internet are so easily filtered and controlled , all the proxy servers in the world ca n't get around all the blocking software that these oppressive countries can put in place . If shortwave broadcasting was invented today it would be regarded as a modern wonder of technology . To bad that the IBB board of governors are so out of touch with conditions outside of the USA . Not everyone in these oppressed countries has internet access . They all have radios ! <p> This s something I have been saying for the past few years now . If shortwave has just been invented people would be going gaga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet . <p> I also have been saying that shortwave as a technology needed to be made sexy . <p> I remember when I was at the VOA in 2012 meeting a few people from the BBG . Well let me just say . Humm ! If I cant say anything nice I wont say anything at all . Only that the ones I met who were making decisions on VOAs future had never lived or traveled outside the US .

@@75207353 @3907353/ <h> A review of the Lowe SRX 100 <p> I recently had the opportunity to spend some quality time with the Lowe SRX 100 ( a.k.a. , Target HF3 , AKG HF-3 , and Garex HF-3 ) , a receiver produced in the UK around 1995-96 . Its not know for being a DXing machine , but virtually any Lowe product has a certain nostalgia factor , not to mention , collectability factor . As you can see in the photo on the right , the SR 100 is a very simple receiver , and as such , its just the type for which I have a personal affinity . <p> The antenna connection and attenuation switch on back panel of radio . ( Click to enlarge ) <p> When I first brought the SRX 100 home and hooked it up , I used the supplied 10 meter antenna wire that Lowe shipped with all of these units when new . The antenna wire has the correct fitting for the antenna connector on the receiver : - an RCA type connector , instead of the more common SO-239 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked it up , plugged in the supplied AC adaptor , and turned on the radioto find I received nothing but loud static . I live in a fairly RFI-free house and area , but the supplied antenna was so good at receiving noise that I thought the receiver was " deaf " and broken . I decided to give it another chance : - I took the SRX 100 into my radio room and hooked it to my large , external horizontal loop antenna ; lo and behold , it came to life ! - Needless to say , it was a relief. - ( I later learned that many others have experienced this symptom with the supplied antenna . ) <p> ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Basics <p> The SRX 100 receiver coverage is from 30 kHz to 30 MHz , in one-kHz steps. - The receiver is a dual-conversion design with the first intermediate frequency at 45 MHz , and the second at- 455 kHz . During the past two months of use , I have noticed no serious overloading . <p> The bandwidth , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wide and narrow settings were used to seeing on modern portables , let alone tabletops . I found , though , that for broadcast listening , the AM filter is near ideal so long as no adjacent signals are present . In crowded conditions , you can tune off-frequency to decrease interference unless your desired signal is sandwiched between two others . <p> The sound quality is a major plus . My unit reminds me very much of the mellow sound I got out of my Palstar R30C ; it has almost a tube-like quality. - And in my book , that 's a huge compliment . <p> Tuning around <p> As simple as the Lowe SRX 100 is , tuning it can take practice . First off , the tuning knob is substantial , with a weighted feelit spins freely and hints of quality workings within . - The actual tuning encoder , moreover , is quite clever . - I thought it odd that this radio had no band switchingto permit moving from meter band to meter band , or even in 1 MHz incrementsinstead , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this era . If you tune the SRX 100 slowly , you will move in 1 kHz increments ; speed up , and you can skip in steps of 10 , 100 or 1,000 kHz steps . So , if I wanted to move from the tropic lower bands up to 11 meters , one really quick spin will get me there in a second . While this seems intuitive , in practice , any jerky movement of the tuning knob will shoot you right past the desired frequency into the hinterlands . <p> Also , 1 kHz increments in single side band can seem like a large tuning step on a modern tabletop radio . - The SRX 100 gets around this with its " Clarify " knob , which allows for fine tuning . The LDC display , though , does not reflect any incremental changes with the clarify knob . <p> Back panel of the Lowe SRX 100 and RCA to BNC adapter ( Click to enlarge ) <p> Sensitivity-wise , the Lowe SRX 100 is quite respectable in the lower bands , but above 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Selectivity-wise , you will have no contest grade receiver here . For most broadcast listening , it does quite well , even on medium wave . - But on SSB , its simply disappointing- in crowded conditions . Forget CW listening unless your " internal filter " ( your brain/ears combo ) can cope with multiple signals at once . <p> Every receiver has pros and cons ; I started noting them from when I first tuned on the radio : <p> Pros : <p> Simple designeven grandpa can figure out these controls without cracking open the manual <p> Nice weighted tuning knob <p> Easy to read LCD display ( see con ) <p> Tuning rate is adaptive to spin rate of tuning knob <p> Pleasant , mellow audio from its built-in speaker , reminiscent of the Palstar R30 series <p> Compact size for a tabletop receiver <p> 12 VDC power supply and current are only at 300 mah <p> Sturdy metal chassis and build quality excellent <p> Attenuator switch ( Con : on back of unit ) <p> Even at time of production , this was a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No adjustable bandwidth <p> SSB bandwidth too wide for listening to CW if any adjacent signals are present <p> AM too wide if competing station within 5 kHz of either side of desired carrier <p> Supplied 10 meter length of antenna wire with RCA plug is useless in most environments <p> No bail <p> Summary <p> This is a fun little radio ! - Even thought its a tad quirky , it may just be the best shortwave radio for an armchair shortwave radio listener , someone who wants an uber-simple design and small footprint . If you find used one on eBay , or with a company like Universal Radio , it may make a nice working addition to any shortwave radio collection . 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 7 thoughts on " A review of the Lowe SRX 100 " <p> I bought an SRX100 in the 90s .

Since he primarily wanted to listen to a local AM broadcaster , I recommended he go a different route with his next rig to save money and extend the radios longevity . <p> I suggested- the ( $61 US ) Sangean H201- which is specifically designed for humid environments . I had considered- this receiver as a gift- in the past , but had never actually used one myself . I felt like it was a pretty safe bet , though . David purchased the H201 and recently shared his review : <p> Well , I 'm so glad that I was patient and waited for a reply before I bought a radio to replace the old one that I had in my bathroom . I think the Sangean H201 is going to be the perfect replacement . I do n't know if anyone has provided a review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment : <p> The H201 is compact . Not quite as small as my 909 but just the right size to sit on my bathroom countertop and not take up near as much room as the radio it replaced . <p> Its appearance is clean , simple and intuitive . It 's also waterproof , a feature that is comforting since it will spend most of its life in the humid environment of a bathroom . The display is large and easily read . The display includes battery strength indicator , band , memory preset , weather alert and frequency in the display . The buttons are just the right size and have a distinct but smooth action . <p> It might have been better for me if the power button had been on the top instead of the bottom right hand face of the cabinet but that is in no way a deal killer . <p> The H201 's reception is fine for what I need it to do which is receive the primary AM radio stations for our metroplex area ( Dallas/Fort Worth ) which brings me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound quality of the H201 is exceptional .

I like the amber display and the half circle carry handle that turns in or out of the cavity in the back of the radio is really convenient . <p> At times I have to adjust the position of the radio to eliminate a bit of static on AM but I think that 's pretty typical for AM . My comments here are not near as technical as some reviews I 've read on other radios , particularly short wave models . <p> While I use and appreciate many of those types of features on my other radios , for my purposes I 'm not sure the technical ' is necessary to promote the positive aspects of this radio . <p> Bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose I needed .

Ive been very pleased with Sangean radios that employ this particular chassis style ( like the- Sangean PR-D5BK , - Sangean PR-D9W , - Sangean PR-D7 , and even the Sangean WFR-28 ) .

However , after 2 years the water proved too much and it appeared the water ruined it . The same thing with a Sony shower radio I had before that .

That is exactly what you 'll find in Jerome S. Bergs- The Early Shortwave Stations : A Broadcasting History Through 1945. - In these days during which shortwave is often viewed only as a legacy technology , its particularly fascinating to read about the days during which shortwave was new on the scene , exerting a disruptive influence , and threatening- the established technology . <p> If you 're a shortwave radio enthusiast , you may already know of Jerome ( Jerry ) Berg ; he is , without a doubt , one of the foremost historians of shortwave radio broadcasting and listening . His knowledge , moreover , grew out of his passion for the radio medium , and it shows in his writing . Berg has authored a- series of history books on the subject on the subject of shortwave broadcast and listening , which this latest work joins : <p> I 'm not sure how Berg manages to convey- his vast store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so , and very successfully . As with the other- works in this series , - The Early Shortwave Stations is chock full of details all entirely- relevant , and Berg manages to weave this complex and multifaceted history into a very comprehensive , comprehensible , and rich story that the reader will enjoy . <p> Moreover , I like the manner in which Berg presents the chapters in The Early Shortwave Stations : the first chapter sets the stage , covering radio broadcasting up to the point of the invention of shortwave ; the chapters then coincide with a decade-by-decade account of shortwave broadcasting , e.g. , chapter 2 covers the 1920s , chapter 3 the 1930s , and chapter 4 covers 1940-1945 ( where Bergs Broadcasting on the Short Waves , 1945 to Today picks up ) . Furthermore , each decade and chapter is covered year by year . This obviously makes for easy future reference : should you like to know- was happening in shortwave broadcasting in 1931 , simply turn to chapter 3 ( page 82 ) to find out . <p> Berg also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - which only made me want to buy his next volume , - Broadcasting on the Short Waves , 1945 to Today . <p> I can say that I learned an extraordinary amount of radio history from- The Early Shortwave Stations , and have enjoyed every minute of it . I 've had this book for a little while now , and it soon became my bedside reading. - Indeed , its been wonderful capping off each day ( or even starting it ) with early shortwave history . I find that it puts many of the changes that are happening in- the industry currently into perspective . <p> And I would be negligent if I did n't  mention the numerous illustrations and stunning images in- The Early Shortwave Stations : - there are enough QSL cards , radio ads , and other print nostalgia within its pages to make for good coffee table reading , too .

As I always say for radios in this price range , my expectations were low . <p> here 's a summary of this little AM/FM radios pros and cons : <p> Back of model RadioShack 12-587 <p> Pros : <p> Very good FM selectivity and sensitivity <p> Excellent FM stereo lock <p> Scan function both useful and quick <p> 10 AM and 10 FM memories ( see con ) <p> Large , amber back-lit LCD display <p> Simple control lock switch on right side <p> AM ( medium wave ) sensitivity adequate <p> AM nulling above average <p> Plastic " blister " packaging very easy to open ! <p> Cons : <p> Tinny sounding audio via built-in speaker <p> Headphone audio lacks high/low ; mid-range only <p> Memory allocations supposedly volatile ( when batteries are replaced ) <p> AM frequency steps fixed at 10 kHz ( can not adapt to 9 kHz steps used in rest of the world ) <p> AM ( medium wave ) sensitivity mediocre at best <p> Complete mute while tuning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful <p> Very sensitive to noise ( QRM ) on the AM band , resulting in static popping/crackling in audio <p> Obviously , this is not a radio for the radio hobbyist or world traveler , as it lacks any real medium wave sensitivity and can not tune in 9 kHz steps . FM tuning is also locked on odd frequencies , thus will not work throughout parts of the world with even spacing . And though the radio is touted as having " extended bass , " the audio is tinny , even via headphones . <p> BUT. - This is a perfect example of a situation in which , though cons outweigh pros , the- RS Model 12-587 is a great match for its intended purpose : my fathers morning walks . Why ? Its a simple-to-operate radio with a large , back-lit display ( Dad wont need to put on his glasses to read it ) . It receives local AM and FM stations very well . The mid-range audio " " while lacking ample fidelity for music " " are perfect for the talk shows he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight , easy to tune , and has a lock feature . It is also remarkably easy to program memories : simply press the program- button until preset flashes in the LCD display , use the scan up/down buttons to choose a memory number then press program again. - Its also very affordable , so no problem to replace as necessary . <p> In conclusion , the RS Model 12-587 is not a performance radio " " and I would n't generally recommend it " " but it suits my fathers needs very well. - Like to walk or run ? Maybe its just what you 're looking for , too . <p> Great review . Radio is way overpriced . Based on its performance , you could have gotten one at the dollar store that would have worked as good . Amazon has radios like this that include the shortwave band for under $10 . <p> My guess is that it will outperform the radio I reviewedespecially on MW .

Remembering your recommendation and wishing to pick up a Tecsun PL-360 as a spare to my CountyComm GP-5 SSB ( Tecsun PL-365 ) , I placed the order for it and a couple of other bits of Tecsun kit with Anon-co . <p> The order arrived in 6 working days to my Gulf coast Texas home , taking longer to travel from Chicago to my home than it took to move from Anon-co in Hong Kong to Chicago and clear customs . <p> I then had a question about the connecting cable included with the Tecsun badged , Tecsun / Kato / Grundig / Eaton , AN200 Loop Antenna . Posed through Ebay Anna promptly answered the question and added a photo of the cable to Anon-co 's Ebay listing for the AN200 . It just does n't  get better than that . You can continue to recommend Anon-co with full confidence from my perspective . <p> I picked up the PL-360 as a lower cost AM/FM/SW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the risk of using the larger and heavier extended ferrite rod loop stick aftermarket antenna that garnered so much interest on your blog a year ago , before CountyComm warned of accelerated wear on the antenna jack . Happily the antenna works just as well on the PL-360 as it did on the GP-5 SSB . <p> Overall I am pleased with the PL-360 . <p> The performance on AM and SW appears to match that of the GP-5 SSB ( Tecsun PL-365 ) albeit with a slightly higher noise floor . Whether this is due to something akin to sample to sample variation or a direct result of inherent design differences between the PL-360 's Silicon Labs Si4734 DSP chipset versus the GP-5 SSB 's Silicon Labs Si4735 DSP chipset I ca n't say . I can say the PL-360 with the included High Gain loop stick external tee antenna received my list of news gathering AM clear channel stations out to 900 miles during the night hours matching the GP-5 SSB . This list includes WGN , WBBM , WLS and KOA at the furtherest extreme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 800 or so miles .

Both radios snag my list of FM stations out to 60 miles . <p> For my purposes both are extremely close in performance to my Sony SW7600GR when using their supplied external loop stick . On AM if you combine one with the larger and heaver aftermarket loopsticks they will slightly outperform the 7600GR combined with a Tecsun / Kato / Grundig / Eaton , AN200 Loop Antenna . The Sony 's speaker gives it the edge in listening pleasure , but on earphones or plugs all three are close . <p> None of forgoing addresses the SSB performance as the PL-360 's chipset does n't  offer that option . <p> I am pleased with the PL-360 , Anna and Anon-co and I do thank you for posting my 7600GR inquiry . <p> I look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

In other words , you must handle it with kid gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio will enjoy expected longevity . <p> If you 're considering purchasing the Tecsun S-8800 , this is an important post . <p> I 've had the S-8800 for about two weeks and- had planned to have audio clip comparisons prepared and posted by now . My exceptionally busy schedule has made this difficultand there a few other complicating factors . <p> First off , the good news : in terms of sensitivity , selectivity and audio fidelity , I 'm very happy with the S-8800 . I 've compared it a number of times with the Tecsun PL-880 and the Sony ICF-SW7600GR and it either holds its own or even has a leg-up on both radios in terms of overall performance . I find that the S-8800s AGC is more stable than my 1st generation PL-880 . <p> Of course , what will be most telling is what you , dear reader , think of the performance when compared in a blind audio test . <p> As I mentioned , though , there are complicating factorsIts not just my schedule which has made the S-8800 review come to a halt . <h> Birdies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first , I thought the noises were due to the fact my mobile phone and Zoom H2N digital recorder were too close to the S-8800. - I dismissed this interference as it did n't  sound like the typical steady tone/carrier birdies I 've come to loath over the years . <p> As my testing continued , though , I quickly realized these variable heterodyne and digital hash noises must be internally-generated . <p> Quite literally , as I was outdoors testing the S-8800 and making this discovery last week , I received a message from SWLing Post contributor , Bertrand Stehle ( F6GYY ) . You might recall , Bertrand provided us with an initial review of his S-8800e ( the European version of the S-8800 ) . He- also started noticing the birdies and , like me , initially assumed they were due to an external source of RFI . <p> Bertrand kindly mapped out the extensive list of birdies he found on his S-8800ehe- noted a total of 81 birdie/carrier locations : <p> 14 birdies on longwave <p> 4 birdies on mediumwave <p> 63 birdies between 1859 29095 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertrands S-8800e and my S-8800 : <p> Only 50-60% of the birdies on my S-8800 are in the same frequency locations as those mapped by Bertrand on his S-8800e <p> The total number of birdies , however , are likely identicalI find birdies where Bertrand had n't  noted them <p> The appearance and intensity of the birdies can vary depending on listening location and the strength of any nearby broadcast signals . I 've noticed four distinct birdie sounds : a variable carrier , a steady carrier , digital hash , and something I might describe as digital variable noises . <p> I 've even noticed some change slightly as you move the radio around . <p> Here are a couple of examples : <h> Example- on 610 kHz : <h> Example on 2009.15 kHz : <h> Moving forward <p> Obviously , this is a major issue for an enthusiast-grade portable . <p> I 'm sharing all of this information with Anna at Anon-Co . No doubt , shell share this information with Tecsun engineering . The last I heard , projected availability of the S-8800 from Anon-Co is late March 2017 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birdies by improving internal grounding and/or shielding ? <p> Until the birdie issue is sorted out , I 'm not proceeding- with audio comparisons or a full review . It goes without saying that , - at present , I could n't recommend purchasing the S-8800 . Sad , because this is otherwise a great radio . <p> I like opening radio boxes to find a cardboard insert like this one . It protects the radio and has so much less waste and individual cardboard bits inside . <p> As I always do when a new radio comes on the scene , I requested to purchase an early release of the Tecsun S-8800- radio for review months ago . - But this time , my contact at the Chinese distributor Anon-Co , Anna , insisted on sending us one " as a gift for the Chinese New Year of the Rooster . " <p> Because I 've worked with Anna at Anon-Co for at least a- decade , having purchased numerous- radios for review and as gifts for family and friends , this was difficult to refuse . - I decided there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an in-depth review and note shortcomings- or deficiencies in the radios Ive purchased from Anon-Co , Anna immediately passes my- feedback and criticisms directly to the manufacturers engineers . I believe this feedback loop between customers , reviewers and manufacturers leads to improved product iterations . Of course , sometimes the negatives can be- so problematic , manufacturers simply drop the product line and move on ( remember the Tecsun R-2010D ? - Case in point ) . So , while there are a number of other eBay retailers in China that distribute Tecsun radios , I prefer Anon-Co for these reasons . <p> Thank you , Anna ! <p> The S-8800 is packed face-down to protect the front panel . <p> Manufacturers and retailers who send me products for review know that we radio geeks have fairly high expectations of our gear , and will therefore hold them to exacting- standards . I 'm not the least among these . - While I endeavor to be realistic , understanding producers limitations and the need for product growth , I also try to- keep my reviews as objective as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences . <p> Personally I prefer smaller , full-featured travel-friendly portables , or else larger tabletop models . - Radios with a form factor like the Tecsun S-8800 are an " in-between " product in my world , thus I rarely use them . <p> That said , every month I receive questions from readers looking for this very " large portable " form factor . Some hobbyists enjoy a radio that 's easy to operate , featuring- simple controls , robust audio , and dedicated external antenna connections . - For these listeners , a large tuning knob and generous- display are more important than things like SSB and synchronous detection.In other words , they want a broadcast receiver . Some have literally asked for a modern version of the venerable Panasonic RF-2200 ( which I admittedly love , an- exception to the rule of my avoidance of large portables ) . In terms of aesthetics , its impossible to live up the legendary solid-state RF-2200 , in my opinionkind of like comparing a modern muscle car with the 1960s original from which it copies its design . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the RF-2200s popular design &amp; form factor : large speaker on the left , large tuning knob , wide-spaced knobs , and a generous- display . Like the RF-2200 , it has a durable , adjustable woven carry strap . - <p> The S-8800 ships with the accessories in the photo below : an IR remote control , two rechargeable cells , an RF adapter , and a USB charging cable . <p> Note the charging cable is only a cable ; the S-8800 does n't  ship with a wall-wart type charger . If you 're like me , you probably have a handful of USB chargers scattered- around your home that you could use for the purpose of charging this radio . - And if you do n't  , you can also use any free USB port on your PC to charge it . <p> USB chargers are cheap and well-known to spew RFI . I doubt you 'll enjoy listening to shortwave or mediumwave/AM while charging the S-8800s internal cells . It does n't  appear the S-8800 was designed for listening while plugged in ; Tecsun- clearly wants you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter is my preference for listening anyway , but it may put off some potential S-8800 owners . <p> The display is easy to read from any angle , and its also easy to view in bright sunlight . In low light , you 'll be pleased with the backlight function . <p> On the right side of the S-8800 , you 'll find an internal/external antenna switch , a DX/local switch , RCA type stereo line-out ports ( covered in the photo above ) and a stereo headphone jack . <p> On the back , you 'll find a mini USB port for charging , an antenna port for a radiator and ground wire , as well as- an FM antenna port. - <p> The battery cover is predictably located at the bottom of the back panel and " " a first for any shortwave radio I 've reviewed " " accommodates two ( supplied ) 3.7V Li-Ion ( internally ) rechargeable cells . <p> The right side panel has no connections or controls . <p> I must admitthe Tecsun S-8800 has some front panel controls I really appreciate . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine tuning control . I also like the dedicated treble and bass controls which can also be found on its predecessors front panels . <p> Over the next week , I 'll be evaluating the performance of the S-8800 . I plan to post blind audio samples as Ive done in the past , comparing the S-8800 to other portables : likely the PL-880 and the ICF-7600GR , PL-660 or PL-680. - Please be patient , however , as making these recordings takes time as I like to make sure each radio has a true representative sample and fair shot at showcasing performance . <p> What about those initial impressions ? - Yes , I must say I do like the package of the S-8800 better than its predecessors . I like the dedicated IR remote control , the many antenna connections , and , so far , the audio fidelity from the built-in speaker . Makes for a nice package . <p> But , ultimately , the proof is in the pudding : - let 's put the S-8800 on the air and compare it with some benchmarks ! 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207385 @3907385/ <h> Category Archives : Reviews <p> Hi there , you might remember my post from last month focussing on the Bonito MegActive MA305 E-field antenna , kindly supplied to me for testing , by Bonito themselves . That post was essentially a report on my experiences travelling to Crete with the MA305 , navigating through security at London Gatwick and Heraklion airports ( mostly with relative ease ) , but more importantly , how well it worked with the equally excellent Eton Satellit portable receiver . Whilst in Crete I managed to copy a number of personal firsts , including CRI on 7295 kHz , via their relay in Bamako , Mali , The Voice of Beibu Radio on 5050 kHz , Nanning , XSL Slot Machine on 6251 kHz USB , Ichihara , Japan , S32 The Squeaky Wheel on 3828 kHz and NHK World Radio Japan , 11910 kHz . I also copied RTM Wai/Limbang FM on 11665 kHz from Kajang , Myanmar Radio on 5985 kHz and AIR Bhopal on 4810 kHz , amongst others all of which I would certainly consider to be difficult catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect for DXing on the move <p> Despite excellent all-round results from the ultra-portable USB powered MA305 , there was one signal I copied , which more than any other , demonstrated the DXing credentials of this antenna ; Radio Tarma from Peru on 4775 kHz . With a TX power of 1 kW , this is a very difficult station to hear in Western Europe , even with a longwire . To catch this station in Crete , with a 22 cm antenna was incredible and it was at that point during my trip that I realised E-field antennas really can work superbly well for hard-core DXers on the move . <p> Upon my return to Oxford , I immediately started thinking about a DXpedition to the local woods I use for what I consider serious DXing . For obvious reasons , E-field antennas require an electrically quiet environment to ensure maximum SNR performance . In noisy environments , these types of antennas amplify the signal of interest and the background electro-smog , thus increasing signal levels but critically , not signal-to-noise . Fortunately , the Oxfordshire wood I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10 minute drive from my QTH as I sort of live in the countryside anyway and the QRM levels there are just about zero . Now , given that this was essentially an experiment to determine the best possible performance from the MA305 , I decided to use my best portable radio . It was quite tempting to pack up the Elad FDM DUO which running on a home-brew battery pack has proven itself to be my best ( pseudo ) portable radio . However , this is supposed to be a real-world test and in this type of scenario , DXpeditions with the Bonito antenna are much more likely to be undertaken with a portable radio . For these reasons I decided to conduct the test with the venerable Sony ICF-2001D . Having proven to be a superb receiver over many , many dxpeditions ( check out the evidence on my YouTube Channel Oxford Shortwave Log ) and still regarded by DXers as one of the best ever portable radios possibly the best it was the obvious choice . <p> I ventured out in early June around 23:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on the edge of the wood and proceeded to set up my cheap camera tripod , slightly modified to accept a 2 metre-long stainless steel tube , into which a slightly thinner 1 metre tube was mounted , topped off with my partially disassembled Selfie Stick which made it back from Crete lol . The antenna was set up in less than 5 minutes and approximately 4 metres above the ground much quicker and easier than de-spooling 100 metres of wire ! With fresh batteries in the Sony and the MA305 powered up using the USB power brick supplied by Bonito , I was ready to start listening . Almost immediately I heard and recorded a personal first ; Lao National Radio , Laos , signing on 6130 kHz , with an excellent signal . Hearing them in the UK was only made possible by the annual two week shut down of the PBS Xizang transmitter in Lhasa , Tibet , but hey , I 'll take it . A brilliant start to my listening session . <p> Over the next two hours I was amazed at what could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind I have spent many hours at the woods previously , listening via various 100 metre longwires and a 200 metre Beverage , my expectations were , I thought , realistic in that the MA305 coupled to the Sony would catch some very good DX . However , I did believe there might be an absence of at least some of the more exotic low power stations on the Tropical Band afterall the MA305 is a very short antenna . Clearly I was wrong , because what transpired during the session surpassed anything I thought possible with this set-up . A list of reception videos follows below and further below , a selection of embedded videos . Some of the entries on this list simply stunned me at the time. - R+dio Educa++o Rural- for starters is such an incredibly difficult signal to hear in Europe , even with a very large antenna . Thus , to hear them on an ultra-compact set-up felt very special. - Radio Mali- is another station that is very difficult to catch with any modulation , except on a large antenna and yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - R+dio Nacional de Angola- and- Alcaravan Radio- are exotics that at best deliver very weak audio and most of the time no audio . Furthermore , the signals from- Emisoras Pio XII , - Myanmar Radio- and- R+dio Clube do Par+- were verging on what I would call superbId never heard anything like it previously except via 100 ( or more ) metres of wire . <p> So what 's next ? Well it would certainly be an interesting experiment to compare the performance of the MegActive antenna with the Wellbrook ALA1530 active loop in a similar environment . I have used the Wellbrook on DXpeditions several times , with often excellent results , however , its not designed to be portable and if SNR performance could be demonstrated as similar between these two products , given a very favourable price delta , the Bonito antenna would add up to be a very compelling purchase decision . More on that to come . In the meantime , thank you very much for **26;607;TOOLONG and I wish you all excellent DX . <p> Please click on the links below for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Ok , so officially it was n't a DXpedition ; it was a well needed vacation in the sun after several hectic months of work , some of which involved travel to slightly more exotic locations . However , these days , I view any travel , whether it be for business or pleasure as a DXpedition opportunity ! Some of you might remember that I purchased a Bonito Boni Whip at the beginning of 2017 because ( a ) I needed another antenna and ( b ) a second Wellbrook loop felt like too much of an extravagance . Theyre excellent antennas for sure , but at around -300 , I could n't justify buying another . Thus , for about a third of the price I bought the Boni Whip . It proved to be an excellent choice very compact and so perfect for my regular DXpeditions , quick to set up and capable of really excellent DX . There are many videos on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel that are testament to this . I wrote a couple of articles , published here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonito , who subsequently contacted me and offered to send over their MegActive MA305 E-field antenna for testing . Dennis made it crystal-clear that I was to do my own thingtest the antenna in any way I saw fit and publish my findings so DXers/radio enthusiasts could learn more about the capabilities of the antenna from another DXer . I was happy to agree to this arrangement and the MegActive MA305 duly arrived , complete with two lengths of ( bayonet BNC terminated ) high quality H-155 coaxial cable . <p> The specifications of the MegActive MA305 are very similar to the Boni Whip ; they both offer a Gain of +3 dBs , second and third order intercept points of greater than +30 and +50 dB respectively and both tune to 300 MHz . The MA305 is supplied with a longer radiating element and tunes down to 9 KHz ( versus the 20 kHz lower limit for the Boni Whip ) . Obviously this is n't a specification that is going to concern most radio enthusiasts ; both offer fantastically wide operating bandwidths . The way in which these antennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are powered . The Boni Whip operates from 12 to 15 V , whilst the MA305 operates from 5 to 15 V. Bonitos design philosophy regarding this feature is based on- the increasing difficulty in procuring reasonably priced analogue external plug-in power supplies ( they are no longer allowed to be produced due to power consumption restrictions ) . <p> Interestingly , when the power supply for my Wellbrook ALA1530 packed up , I called them to purchase a replacement and was told they only have limited stocks remaining . Thus , a solution for powering active antennas with a suitable low-noise supply is an issue that needs resolving . The guys at Bonito figured a USB power source was suitably quiet and with USB power bricks almost ubiquitous these days for charging mobile phones and other portable electronic devices on-the-go , the idea could be applied to their active antennas . The result is the MegActive MA305 , designed to operate at 5 Volts with no loss of performance . As a DXer who probably spends more time listening on DXpeditions than I do in my shack at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often carry a cheap Chromebook laptop to use as an additional power source for my camera phone when Im DXing , so Bonitos design approach resonated with me completely . <p> - <h> Travelling with the MegActive MA305 <p> Ok , so the MA305 is very compact and very light indeed perfect for a trip to Crete ! However , I know from many conversations with my YouTube friends and followers that some of us feel a slight sense of trepidation carrying shortwave radios and antenna systems on board flights , be they national or international . I myself was n't really concerned other than if my bag got pulled from the X-ray machine , there 's often quite a long wait whilst the security staff work through the queue of luggage requiring erhuman intervention ! Predictably , my rucksack did get pulled and I waited patiently until it was my turn to explain the contents ! Looking back on this retrospectively , its hardly surprising . Other than the usual holiday paraphernalia , my rucksack contained : <p> A 10.0 metre length of H-155 coaxial cable <p> A 1.0 metre length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coaxial Power Inserter <p> MA305 Antenna Amplifier <p> Bonito USB Power Brick <p> Bonito USB Power Cable <p> NooElec RTL-SDR dongle <p> NooElect Ham It Up upconverter <p> Various screened cables and connectors <p> 10 metres of equipment wire <p> I explained to the ( friendly ) security chap that I was a shortwave radio hobbyist and identified the various pieces of equipment for him , as he removed them from my rucksack . He confirmed my X-ray had lit up ( in blue as it happens ) with metallic/electronic items and was even kind enough to swivel his monitor to show me the mess of items strewn across the screen just as I had thrown them all into my rucksack ! However , after quickly swabbing some of the items , he said all was fine and hoped that I enjoyed my holiday and listening . Service with a smile at Gatwick Airport and I was on my way . My outbound experience got me thinking whether it would be possible to pack my DXing kit in such a way that it would n't alarm airport security . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables into my ( checked-in ) suitcase . I figured it would be obvious there was no security risk associated with cables alone . I then packed my RTL-SDR , upconverter and all of the MS305 components very neatly into a single box and put that in my carry-on rucksack . Now , some might argue that security measures at Heraklion International Airport in Crete differ a little from London Gatwick , but I observed staff at the X-ray machine very carefully monitoring every piece of luggage passing through it including my own and I passed straight through without a problem . All I did was take my laptop out as usual , and put it in a separate tray . Job done . <h> DXing with the MegActive MA305 <p> My apartment in Crete was on the second floor and a large balcony provided a decent outdoor location for DXing . As regards electrical noise , the location was much quieter than my shack at home , but it certainly was n't perfect , thus a good test of the MA305 in a real-world pseudo-urban environment . in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some tape and managed to construct a mount for the amplifier , increasing the overall height above ground by about 1.5 metres and displacing the radiating element an additional 2 metres thereabouts from the building . I 'm not sure whether it made much difference , but it seemed like the sensible thing to do for less than 10 Euros . <p> Despite hearing a lot of excellent DX whilst in Crete , there is one signal I copied , which more than any other , demonstrates the DXing credentials of the MA305 and Eton Satellit for that matter . In the early hours of the morning ( 00:59 hrs UTC ) I copied and recorded Radio Tarma from Peru on 4775 kHz . With a TX power of 1 kW , this is a very difficult station to hear in Western Europe , even with a longwire . To catch this station in Crete , at all , was incredible on an ultra-compact set-up . It was at this point during the trip that I realised E-field antennas really do work superbly well for hard-core DXers on the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Oxfordshire countryside , where electrical noise is absent . This I did a few days ago , with some quite amazing results on the Tropical Band . More on that to come in my next post . In the meantime , please find text links and embedded videos for selected reception recordings , below . Many more recordings are available on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel and please do n't  hesitate to contact me if you require further information on the MA305 or the Eton Satellit . Thanks for **26;635;TOOLONG and I wish you all excellent DX . <h> Other notable catches 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , Tom Stiles , who- notes that he s recently posted a video review of the Tivdio V-115 on his YouTube channel . He added that the V-115 is an , " amazing little shortwave radio with many functions including MP3 recording . " <p> After watching most of Toms video this morning while packing for YAT ( Yet Another Trip ! ) I thought purchasing a V-115 from Amazon might make a lot of sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable that does even a mediocre job of recording shortwave to MP3 files . <p> I did a quick search on Amazon only to discover , - in the search results , - that the quickest I could receive the V-115 was next Wednesday . I considered- shipping it to my hotel . <p> A bit confused , I opened the large container that holds all of the portables I use for review benchmarks . It was the only place this radio could be hiding . Inside , I discovered an unopened box containing an Audiomax SRW-710Slooking in my Amazon order history , I confirmed that the Tivdio V-115 is also badged as the Audiomax 710-S and Amazon linked the two . <p> Then , my memory kicked in ! I purchased the SRW-710S for review , but pushed it to the backburner . Then in December 2016 , SWLing Post contributor , Troy Riedel , submitted a full review of the SRW-710S . <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , - Dennis Kalinichenko , who shares the following review : <h> The- Shoroh R-326 military radio <p> by- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment I recently bought to my collection would be interesting to all readers and contributors . <p> This is the R-326 " Shoroh " ( " Rustle " ) general coverage military tube shortwave radio receiver . These were produced decades ago , back in 1963 . These portable receivers were in active military use in the Soviet Army until the early 2000s , when the R-326 was finally discontinued- . Today , this set is no more a spy secret , but a great collectors item and also a good receiver for home use . <p> My set cost me about $150 US , which is rather expensive for this radio . The R-326 was plentiful- in the local market in 90-s , right after the fall of the Soviet Union , very cheap and popular between radio amateurs , but nowadays this radio has become more and more rare , so the price rises up . <p> My R-326- arrived from Khabarovsk city , the Russian Far East , where , I believe , for many years it was on duty in some of the Soviet radio intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , original military 100 ohm headphones , original rectifier box for 2,5 V output , 12 meter long wire antenna on a reel , the 1,5 meter famous " Kulikov " mini-whip antenna , the isolator for placing it on top of the radio and some minor accessories . <p> Originally , the R-326 radio came with two batteries1,25 V eachfor field use , but mine are totally drained and need to be serviced , so I havent- used them so far . <p> The radio is a light-weight , only 33 lbs , which is a real minimum for Soviet military equipmentthe famous R-250 radios weight is up to 220 lbsso , in comparison , this unit is really portable . You can easily put it in your car using the attached leather handle and take it with you on a weekend trip . No other military radio can be so " travel-friendly " ; this is one of the reasons it was so popular in the ham radio and SWL- communities . <p> The case is made out of steel and looks so solid you may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In no way could you harm the box constructed to resist nuclear attacks . It is waterproof and sealedso I can be confident that no previous owner has ever tried to solder something in the guts . <p> The radio is a super heterodyne containing 19 ( ! ) special mini tubes and covering 6 SW bands , from 1 to 20 MHz . It works in both AM and SSB ( CW ) modes , having an on-board adjustable bandwidth control from 300 Hz to 6 kHz . <p> On the front panel , there are two scales : one is rough/coarse , and above is the precise one , a so-called photoscale , which may be adjusted to match real radio-frequency using the four screws near the sun protection visor . With this scale , you do n't  actually need a digital readout . It also has a BFO control with a zero setting , adjustable AGC levels for AM and CW , and adjusting screw for matching the antenna input , as marked for 12 m long wire , 1,5 m and 4 m whip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two output sockets on the front panel , for 100 ohm headphones and 600 ohm line-out . <p> The power consumption is very low for s tube radio , the rig needs only 1,4 A at 2.5 volts DC ( including the lightscale ) . I use the original power transformer ( transistor rectifier ) and therefore switch the unit into the 220 AC outlet . <p> The sensitivity of the radio is extremely high and equals some modern transceivers . The selectivity is also impressive . No doubt it was really great for 1960s . But there 's negative side as well : the radio easily overloads even from the outdoor long wire antennas . The best fit is the " Kulikov " mini-whip that you can see in the photos . <p> When you switch on the radio , you hear noise , the level of which seems high , so you lower the volume down . Yes , the radio is sensitive and a bit noisy . But thanks to the tubes it sounds really amazing in the headphones . The SSB ham operators voice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being actually 2-speed : outer wheel is for fast tuning , inner wheel for precise tune . <p> Its- absolutely obvious that nowadays a simple Degen or Tecsun may be more useful than this old and heavy unit with big and tough knobs and switches . But what a pleasure sitting in front of this perfect tube radio at night , with the headphones on , turning the huge tuning wheels , looking into the moving dim scale , listening into distant voices and rustles , feeling yourself a Cold War times operator near the rig . <p> Isnt this experience priceless ? <p> Indeed the experience is priceless , Dennis ! Better yet , your R-326 now has an owner that will keep it in working order and enjoy it on a regular basis . I personally believe keeping these vintage rigs on the air is one way to preserve , and experience first hand , a little of our collective radio history . <p> Thank you so much for sharing your review and excellent photos of the R-326 ! <p> Post readers : If , like Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase/review here on the SWLing Post , please consider submitting your story and photos . Being a huge fan of vintage radio , I truly enjoy reading through and publishing your- reviews . - I know many other readers feel the same ! <p> I also wanted to let you know your confidence in Ebay seller Anna and Anon-co continue to be well founded . Remembering your recommendation and wishing to pick up a Tecsun PL-360 as a spare to my CountyComm GP-5 SSB ( Tecsun PL-365 ) , I placed the order for it and a couple of other bits of Tecsun kit with Anon-co . <p> The order arrived in 6 working days to my Gulf coast Texas home , taking longer to travel from Chicago to my home than it took to move from Anon-co in Hong Kong to Chicago and clear customs . <p> I then had a question about the connecting cable included with the Tecsun badged , Tecsun / Kato / Grundig / Eaton , AN200 Loop Antenna . Posed through Ebay Anna promptly answered the question and added a photo of the cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't  get better than that . You can continue to recommend Anon-co with full confidence from my perspective . <p> I picked up the PL-360 as a lower cost AM/FM/SW backup to the GP-5 SSB that would allow me to accept the risk of using the larger and heavier extended ferrite rod loop stick aftermarket antenna that garnered so much interest on your blog a year ago , before CountyComm warned of accelerated wear on the antenna jack . Happily the antenna works just as well on the PL-360 as it did on the GP-5 SSB . <p> Overall I am pleased with the PL-360 . <p> The performance on AM and SW appears to match that of the GP-5 SSB ( Tecsun PL-365 ) albeit with a slightly higher noise floor . Whether this is due to something akin to sample to sample variation or a direct result of inherent design differences between the PL-360 's Silicon Labs Si4734 DSP chipset versus the GP-5 SSB 's Silicon Labs Si4735 DSP chipset I ca n't say . I can say the PL-360 with the included High Gain loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM clear channel stations out to 900 miles during the night hours matching the GP-5 SSB . This list includes WGN , WBBM , WLS and KOA at the furtherest extreme . It also includes Mexico City 's XEEP 20kW at night at 800 or so miles . Switching to SW broadcast using the whip antenna and Tecsun 's / CountyCom EZTune system day or night the PL-360 and GP-5 SSB select and load the same stations within the PL-360 's slightly shorter SW tuning range . <p> Dittio on FM on the whip . Both radios snag my list of FM stations out to 60 miles . <p> For my purposes both are extremely close in performance to my Sony SW7600GR when using their supplied external loop stick . On AM if you combine one with the larger and heaver aftermarket loopsticks they will slightly outperform the 7600GR combined with a Tecsun / Kato / Grundig / Eaton , AN200 Loop Antenna . The Sony 's speaker gives it the edge in listening pleasure , but on earphones or plugs all three are close . <p> None of forgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  offer that option . <p> I am pleased with the PL-360 , Anna and Anon-co and I do thank you for posting my 7600GR inquiry . <p> I look forward to your blog . <p> Steve <p> Thank you , Steve ! I 'm happy to hear the 7600GR posting helped youthats what this community is all abouthelping each other . Thanks to everyone who commented on that post . <p> And , yes , I think what surprises so many SWLs is the fact that Anna at Anon-Co actually knows Tecsun- radios as well , if not better , than the manufacturer . I 've only had good experiences working with Anon-Co- and that 's why I recommend them so readily . Anna provides excellent customer service . ( Click here to check out Anon-Co on eBay . ) <p> I 'm also happy to hear you 're enjoying the PL-360 and that you understand the risk of using the large ferrite bar on this radio series ( PL-360 , 365 and GP5 DSP and SSB ) . I use my antenna as well , though like you , very carefully . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm careful not to put a strain on the antenna in any way ; keeping it balanced and steady . In other words , you must handle it with kid gloves . If you take these precautions , I think your radio will enjoy expected longevity . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

I also attended the NPOTA ( National Parks On The Air ) forum on Sunday . <p> I 've also already started a re-cap/review of the 2017 Hamvention which I plan to post in the next few days . Stay tuned . <p> In the meantime , though , a number of readers have asked what I brought home from the Hamvention . Though I had no intention to buy stuff- this yearseriouslyI did manage to come home with a few treasures . <h> Panasonic RF-2200 <p> If you 've been reading the SWLing Post for a while , you 'll know I 'm a big fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great performer even though the analog tuning can be a bit squirrelly . <p> Where it really shines is on mediumwave , though . Its easily the best AM portable I own . <p> My buddy , Eric ( WD8RIF ) , pointed out this RF-2200 ( see photo above ) in the flea market . Since I already own an RF-2200 , I had no intention of buying one . <p> While taking a photo of it , the seller started telling giving me details . He said hed never used batteries in it , and only used a small external wire antenna connected on the back ( his homebrew connector was still attached ) . He then mentioned that he also had the original box , manuals , accessories and packing materials . <p> I put my camera phone away and picked it up to take a closer look . It had obviously been taken care of over the years . The battery compartment was immaculate and the telescoping whip did n't  have any bends or missing sectionsit was straight , clean and original . <p> Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He wanted $70 . <p> Sold ! <p> With absolutely no hesitation , I reached for my wallet . Sure , I 've already got an RF-2200 , but one can never have too many RF-2200s . Right ? <p> I took a few photos of the RF-2200 this morning : <p> Without a doubt , this was my exciting 2017 flea market find. - . <h> MFJ-8121 Analog Shortwave Portable <p> While browsing the inside exhibits late afternoon on Saturday , I spotted this analog portable from MFJ Enterprises . <p> In truth , I did n't  realize MFJ even had a shortwave portable in their product line . <p> This particular unit was on the clearance table and was labeled as a " factory second . " The sales person told me it was likely due to the damaged box ( the unit inside had no visible blemishes ) . <p> At $12 , I decided to purchase it . <p> You see , I get a lot of requests from readers asking for recommendations of simple analog portables . I thought I might eventually review this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AA batteries in the radio and , sadly , it produced no audio . The tuning indicator works , but the speaker does n't  even produce a hiss . I suspect this is the real reason it was being sold on the clearance table . <p> I might contact MFJ and let them know about this , or I might simply pop the radio open and see if its a broken connection . <h> HamSource flashlight <p> And finallywhile not a terribly exciting purchaseI did also pick up this CREE LED flashlight at the Ham Source booth . Its small , bright and runs on one AA battery . It has three settings : high , low and flashing . It appears to be very durable and the beam can be focused . For eight bucks , its the perfect flashlight to live in my new Tom Bihn Synapse 25 backpack . <h> That 's all , folks ! <p> Looking back , I 'm quite impressed with my self-control . I really did n't  want to return home with any new finds . If anything , I 'm trying to downsize right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Filippi , who shares an eBay link to this Panasonic RD-9820the matching antenna coupler for the Panasonic RF-2200 . Mario notes that RF-2200 owners might take note as the auction price is on a more reasonable trajectory than ones have in past auctions . This 9820 also includes the box . <p> Almost always items are sold as-is , no returns , have mediocre low resolution product photos , and are not properly tested . In the case of this RF-2200 , it appears the Goodwill employee turned on the radio and tuned the FM band which worked fine . <p> If you 're willing to take the risk , though , you can often snag great deals on ShopGoodwill . <p> Hi . I own one RF-2200 after buying it in eBay in March 2008 . Since then it became my favourite portable radio and as everybody has commented , its a pleasure to hear MW with it . <p> I explain this due to the fact that it has a good rotative ferrite antenna and also because the narrow and wide filters have a suitable shape for MW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other by 10 KHz , so you do n't need a very sharp filter . The narrow one is not so narrow , just enough to attenuate maybe 6 db the splatter from the louder station and not loosing audio quality . <p> When you tune around you have the impression that the filter shape suites perfectly for MW , making the audio quality very pleasant . I would never sell it . If you are interested i 've captured a short clip while playing with it outdoor on 7 MHz band , hearing ham stations on AM , SSB and CW . <p> Pay attention to how loud and clear i was hearing stations at 400 Km in AM : <p> I agree with you completely . At least here in countries where MW stations are spaced at 10 kHz , I find the RF-2200 a mediumwave DX boss ! <p> I 'm constantly amazed with the RF-2200s MW sensitivity and selectivityand low noise floor . That combo , along with the filter shapes Juan- mentions and the excellent built-in full-fidelity speaker make for a proper listening experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio with fortitude and purpose . <p> The only place Ive ever really searched for an RF-2200 is eBay . I like eBay , because if you receive a faulty unit , you can typically return it or have some sort of recourse ( as long as the seller accepts returns ) . <p> I would only buy an RF-2200 ( or any vintage solid-state rigs ) - from a seller that has near 100% ratings with a number of radio sales in their past . - That is , if you 're seeking a working unit . <p> Though the RF-2200 is vintage and thus might eventually need repair . Its ultimately reparable by a skilled technician , though . - My buddy Vlado , for example , has repaired 2200s- in the pastindeed , we cracked my RF-2200 open a few months ago to clean contacts . <p> Panasonic RF-2200s typically cost between $175-300 for one that 's mechanically and cosmetically sound . Of course , NOS units go for much more and units with faults sell for much less . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207391 @3907391/ <h> Updated version of the Sangean ATS-909X ? <p> I had read with interest a review on Amazon about a purchaser receiving a Sangean ATS-909X in black with the firmware listed as " P-01 " . I can confirm that this is indeed the case and that I am curious as to whether there is more than just a simple firmware revision . <p> Brief history with my unit : I originally purchased one new ( only available in white in Australia factory backed ) in August . The packaging was as I remembered from years ago and the firmware was 1.29 . After a few happy months of use sans batteries I decided to slot in some Eneloops . First charge nearly cooked the batteries then the unit refused to charge at all . Back to the retailer . <p> A few days before Christmas I got a call that a replacement was sent from the distributor and promptly trained it over to pick it up . <p> First impression is the box is now all white with the new look Sangean logo . This unit is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old unit started at 87.5MHz . Upon switching on , firmware check showed " P-01 " . <p> Now , differences <p> The biggest disappointment for me is the backlight . The old unit backlight had a beautiful even light blue colour across the LCD panel . The new one has a distinctly darker browny tinge on the left and bright bluish rings of light where the LEDs are on the right . I think whatever was behind the LCD display that gave it the uniform light has been removed or moved . I know I used to be able to see some sort of ribbon cable just behind the Page and mode region on the LCD which the new unit does not have . That or quality is an issue . <p> My partner ca n't see any issue with the display but then she is well aware that I am picky . <p> Mediumwave reception appears to be much better on the new unit , however I do note one static hash frequency at 885 kHz . Seems very narrow and does n't  affect reception for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a distinct hiss . Nothing major and music clarity is very good because of this but DXing in wide mode can get tiring . <p> After- listening to MW for about an hour , the unit drifts about 1kHz down ( in 30 deg C heat ) . During normal operation , you do n't  notice ithowever , when trying ECSS using SSB it will vary from cold at nearly dead on frequency to dropping to the top cusp of the next lowest kHz when hot . It may be that the old unit was the same but was calibrated slightly higher hence it never dropped a kHz on the display when hot . <p> LW is of no use in Australia however the new unit does have weak MW images , something I did not note on the old unit . Aircraft NDBs are all there . <p> SSB . Hmmm . There is a problem as others have noted . First there is quite prominent drift due to heat . The old unit was rock solid and had very , very good ECSS capabilities . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usable . I think the techs forgot to set the DSP bandwidth to narrow in SSB mode . It seems extremely wide . There is no tune muting though ( in any mode ) when using the wheel but a carefulfinger is needed to get close to zero beat . <p> Shortwave is hash for me as I live in units where people seem to buy cheap LED RF spewing globes . Ugh . It seems the same as the old unit . It needs AC to get maximum sensitivity . Go battery and there is a definite deafness . <p> FM is superb . Only difference to the old unit is the stereo decode threshold . The old unit would decode stereo well before RDS . This new unit requires at least 7/10 before decoding stereo . Some fringe stations will get RDS info without ever getting stereo decode . No biggie , especially since unit only has one speaker . <p> I am thinking that the DSP chip has changed on P-01 units as the slight differences in operation and look behind the LCD panel makes me think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate chip changes . <p> Happy New Year , Avo <p> Thank you for your evaluation of the " P-01 " version of the venerable Sangean ATS-909X , Avo . <p> Post- readers : have you also noticed performance differences between legacy- and current production ATS-909X models ? <h> 24 thoughts on " Updated version of the Sangean ATS-909X ? " <p> It seems that I will keep my good old Sangean 909x for many years to come .

Changed it for a new one with 1A rate and problem is now completely forgotten . <p> Reception of CW on the 909X is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CW . This is 2.0 kHz or .5 of the bandwidth used for full dual sideband AM in the narrow IF bandpass mode . This may be too wide for for some CW fans , but OK for some not used to crowded CW conditions . I believe that it is safe to say that the 909X is not optimized for maximum CW reception . <p> Very good point . but I would buy this radio over one that can not receive SSB/CW at the price point for this radio . A shortwave radio without a BFO function is like a motorcycle with a top speed of 35 mph . <p> I wanted to look at the circuit or dismantle radio and I found this Russian website . Just from looking at the pictures and the soldering on the circuit board looks really poor . I 'm glad I found this website because now I know why this radio has issues . I do n't  speak Russian but please take a look a the pictures.http : //ixbt.photo/ ? id=photo:695863 <p> I read Avo Ohanians post about his new Sangean ATS-909X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased new from Amazon in the spring of 2015 and features firmware version 1.29 . I have no experience with firmware version P-01 and cant offer any help with this but experience with my 909X may help clarify some aspects about its operation and performance . <p> I believe that there were two or three SW memory pages devoted to Russian stations factory loaded with my 909X . None were useful so I deleted them soon after acquiring the radio and reprogrammed the pages for countries and stations not provided in the default pages . I wonder if P-01 still shows all of the Russian stations ? <p> The 909X sensitivity issue is well known . MW sensitivity with the built-in ferrite rod antenna is very good . FM sensitivity with the telescopic whip is outstanding and SW sensitivity with the telescopic whip is mediocre . SW sensitivity with the supplied ANT-60 is very good . With an outdoor random wire or long wire antenna SW sensitivity is excellent . I have not chosen to do modifications to the 909X that may improve SW whip antenna performance at the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antennas , anyway . When going portable for traveling I use the ANT-60 for shortwave . I use battery power for all SWLing as the wall wart AC power supply does a fine job of introducing noise to all parts the SW spectrum . This probably affects MW and LW as well . <p> LCD display . Yes , my 909X display has a slight blue tint . This hue will vary with ambient lighting and is difficult to capture accurately with digital cameras . No ribbon cable or other parts are visible through the screen , lit or unlit . Like all LCD screens , the appearance can be pretty weird if viewed through polarized lenses . This LED display is flawless , in my book . <p> I sometimes use the 909X SSB functions for ECSS operation on SW broadcast stations . I have noticed some frequency drift if using ECSS over more than 10 minutes or so . This drift is no more than than one 40 Hz SSB fine tuning step , however . The drift can be alternately up or down in frequency . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to temperature or battery drain or both . <p> I use Panasonic standard white Eneloop batteries in my 909x and charge them in the radio . Understand that Eneloop batteries have a nominal voltage of 1.2V and that non-rechargeable Duracell copper top alkaline batteries are 1.5V but closer to 1.7V if unused and fresh . Sensitivity of the 909X is directly related to battery charge voltage . The more voltage , the more sensitivity . This is especially evident when using battery power for SW listening . Sensitivity with new alkaline batteries is the same as running the 909X from AC power until the batteries begin to drain . With freshly charged Eneloops you are beginning with less than 1.5V volts which will drop as the battery drains . But wait , it gets more complicated The charging system on my 909X is tiered . The charge controller will not offer the same charge profile with each charging cycle . To maintain the best SW performance with Eneloop batteries I recharge them fairly often , after about 4-5 hours of operation and before the first battery charge state bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the charge cycle ( indicated by the red charging LED ) lasts only 20 minutes or so and the batteries will be charged to well below 1.5V . However , if I let the radio and batteries cool and turn the 909X on and off to actuate another charge cycle the batteries will be charged on a longer cycle ( up to two hours or more ) and the Eneloops will be charged to close to 1.5V . I believe that these tiered charge cycles are designed to maximize NiMH battery life . The tiered charge cycles are actually controlled within the Silicon Labs DSP chip . There is a special model of this chip that includes this function and it is the chip listed in the 909X service manual . <p> All in all , I have been very happy with my 909X . Everything still works and I use it a lot , almost daily . I often have it ready to use next to my Hammarlund SP-600 JX-21 . Although the SP-600 is more sensitive and offers more versatile selectivity options on MW and SW the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what frequency I 'm listening to the 909X has obvious advantages . <p> So Avo , I hope that this information helps you in trying to figure out if changes have been made to the 909X along with the change in firmware version . I have talked to Sangean USA customer service during US West Coast business hours on other matters . He was pretty helpful . The phone number is in the operating instructions book . <p> SW page 22 and 23 are presets named RUSSLAND if that is what you are referring to . <p> Unfortunately the drift on my new unit is substantially more than just a 40Hz click and it is definitely heat related as I primarily use the power adapter . It is unfortunate that the display is not setup for 100 or 10 Hz units so I can make a call on drift range . I suspect a TCXO would be too costly for the price point . Not a huge issue as you do n't  notice it in general use . <p> On the plus side , this new unit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity . However the IF bandwidth is definitely wider . It struggles sometimes with a weak station adjacent to a powerhouse in wide mode ( which of course is to be expected ) . There is also a prominent hiss on anything lower than a 9/10 . The 1.29 unit was nevertheless much better behaved on both points . The offshoot is excellent clarity with music in wide mode . I suppose it is here that additional bandwidths would be beneficial . <p> I want to correct one bit of misinformation I provided regarding the 909X battery charger . The charger IC is not part of the Silicon Labs Si4735-D60 GFN20 which provides complete broadcast tuner and receiver functions . The battery charge controller IC is the ON Semiconductor MC33340 . Both ICs are designed and made in the USA in Texas and Arizona , respectively . <p> One more point : A BFO is no longer a piece of hardware but just a software function embedded into the DSP . It is not surprising you have to buy another radio to get one . It is entirely possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can download the latest firmware update , but no one will make any money selling the newer version . <p> As the 909X is a hybrid unit , how much of the DSP capability is being natively used ? To my understanding , the 909X still utilises discrete IF filters rather than using the software embedded in the chip . Likewise , does it do SSB in-chip ? I am not aware of any Silicon Labs or Analog Devices DSP RF chipset that offers SSB . If it did , the drift I perceive in my new unit would be compensated for by the algorithm in the DSP chip . <p> Am I correct in understanding 909x may be just an Armstrong superheterodyne radio with all the DSP functions only handling the user input buttons ( user entry of band , frequency , mode , volume , tone ) and output LCD display ( S-meter , frequency , band other stuff displayed ) ? possibly some audio filtering , processing AGC etc . <p> It would be not much more than a digital version of a Hammarlund SP 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power consumption and possibly some audio processing function . The local oscillator would likely be digitally synthesized . Its core benefit is the drift would be fundamentally the stability of the master crystal oscillator of the DSP and not some LC tuned circuit . <p> So the question is what can this do that a SP600 cant and vise versa . <p> If eBay prices are in any respect related to value then a SP-600 that is a good candidate for restoration will cost you $400-800 depending mostly on cosmetic conditions . Recapping ( as needed ) and alignment will cost you more unless you DIY . Keep in mind that IF realignment of the SP-600 requires visual alignment with a spectrum analyzer with frequency sweep capability . So , if you could buy a well-maintained and perfrrming SP-600 specimen on eBay expect a cost of well over $1,000.00 . <p> My ATS-909X has v 1.29 firmware and I also notice the poor SSB performance and brownish tint in the LCD display . The AF gain has to cranked right up in order to hear SSB which gives the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external antenna applied ( ANT-60 ) . <p> In addition , the AGC seems too fast making it especially difficult to listen to SSB for any length of time . Only broadcast band listening seems to be stable FM ( excellent ) , MW ( Good ) and SW ( Good ) . <p> I 'm wondering if Sangean made subtle changes to these radios but did n't  update the firmware revision to reflect this ? <p> In any event , Ive gone back to SSB listening with my ATS-909 which is rock solid in performance except for the high battery consumption . <p> Quite disappointed with the ATS-909X . It looks the part but fails to deliver . <p> I queried about the display and the retailer agreed for a replacement unit . We checked my current unit and the brand new in box unit and the display was even worse in the new one so I opted to stick with the one I had . It is definitely a drop in quality compared to the one I bought in August . That 1.29 unit had very good strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful rich blue backlight with no shadow or tinting . I think Sangean is concentrating more on their DAB and WiFi units nowadays , which is quite understandable . <p> Still , I am lying in bed in 32 degree heat listening to a remote MW station fading in and out playing 80s music and loving it . Wouldnt want it any other way . My Pure Sensia never gets used anymore even though I used to listen to this station via web stream on it . Its just not the same .. <p> I just tuned in to the VOLMET weather report txing on USB and found the readability to be excellent . So for whatever reason , ECSS may be a little problematic but I had no problem with an actual SSB tx . <p> As an aside , I tried a WFR28c ( that had its own qc issues I really think Sangean is letting quality slip whilst still charging a premium . This in itself may make me jump ship ) for a few days and found the DAB reception to be excellent and FM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league as the 909x . Internet reception was a bit hit and miss . This unit seemed very picky with wifi signal quality , something I have never encountered with any other equipment . It would randomly drop connection . Still , I liked it ! <p> This post was a very interesting read . I enjoyed the observations and the comments . I 'm writing here to see if anyone of you can give me accurate info . <p> I recently acquired a pre-owned ATS-909X in mint condition . I note that the firmware version is " 1.18 " . After reading so many comments all over the internet about this radios firmware versions , I decided to email Sangean in California to learn if I could send the radio to them for a firmware upgrade . The following day , they telephoned me ( ! ) and the fellow told me that there " was no upgrade for the ATS-909X " and that my firmware was just fine . Perhaps it is okay , but is it the latest firmware version ( and the optimum version ) ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207395 @3907395/ <h> Radio Netherlands says farewell in style <p> Thursday night , by the light of an oil lamp , I tuned my trusty Sony portable shortwave to 6,165 kHz . At 2:00 UTC , I was rewarded with a rich , full signal from Radio Netherlands Worldwide 's transmission site in Bonaire . Here in this off-grid cabin , on sixty rural acres , I bask in the freedom from electrical noise that might otherwise interfere with my shortwave radio listening " at least in this respect , this is the perfect DXpedition cabin . <p> The signal coming out of Bonaire , however , would have overcome any interference : Radio Netherlands , my dear friend of some 32 years , had opened a special frequency for those of us in eastern North Americain order to say their good-byes to the airwaves . <p> I can only describe the experience of listening as radio blisspure radio blissmarred only by the bittersweet realization that these were RNW 's final days on the air . The experience harkened back to the day when the big broadcasters had booming signals directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief . <p> The broadcast was simply entitled Farewell and Thank You . You can hear it just as I heard it " through my recordinghere ( actual broadcast starts at 1:15 ) : <p> Then , all day Friday , for nearly 24 hours straight , RNW bid good-bye and farewell to various parts of the world via shortwave , satellite and the internet . I was lucky enough to catch two more broadcasts . <p> This time of day ( 19:00 UTC ) , however , I needed bigger ears than the Sony could provide . I was listening to broadcasts targeting west and east Africa , not North America . Having already charged my laptop battery , I plugged in the Bonito Radiojet ( an SDR that I 'm currently reviewing ) and , just before 1900 UTC , directed her towards 17,605 kHz . Though my Sony found the signal barely audible , the RadioJet produced beautiful fidelity . <p> This RNW broadcast , entitled The First 50 Years , took listeners through the highlights and history of the Dutch radio service . Here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign-off <p> RNW headquarters in Hilversum , Netherlands ( photo coutesty : RNW ) <p> At 20:00 UTC , RNW broadcast their very final show " a repeat of Farewell and Thank You ( above ) appropriately targeting Africa once more . I tuned the dial to 11615 kHz and listened again to the full broadcast . This time , however , as the program drew to its close , the broadcast crew added a personal message . <p> Jonathan Groubert , the talented host of The State We 're In , broadcasted live from Hilversum 's Studio 4 for a deeply touching adieu . Tears were shed , and I 'm not ashamed to confess that I , too , listened through a haze of them as these capable and dedicated journalists , whom I 've grown to trust , signed off the RNW airwaves for the last time . <p> RNWmy dear radio friends " I 'm going to miss you .

@@75207397 @3907397/ <h> Category Archives : Mobile Shortwave <p> Hi there , you might remember my post from last month focussing on the Bonito MegActive MA305 E-field antenna , kindly supplied to me for testing , by Bonito themselves . That post was essentially a report on my experiences travelling to Crete with the MA305 , navigating through security at London Gatwick and Heraklion airports ( mostly with relative ease ) , but more importantly , how well it worked with the equally excellent Eton Satellit portable receiver . Whilst in Crete I managed to copy a number of personal firsts , including CRI on 7295 kHz , via their relay in Bamako , Mali , The Voice of Beibu Radio on 5050 kHz , Nanning , XSL Slot Machine on 6251 kHz USB , Ichihara , Japan , S32 The Squeaky Wheel on 3828 kHz and NHK World Radio Japan , 11910 kHz . I also copied RTM Wai/Limbang FM on 11665 kHz from Kajang , Myanmar Radio on 5985 kHz and AIR Bhopal on 4810 kHz , amongst others all of which I would certainly consider to be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfect for DXing on the move <p> Despite excellent all-round results from the ultra-portable USB powered MA305 , there was one signal I copied , which more than any other , demonstrated the DXing credentials of this antenna ; Radio Tarma from Peru on 4775 kHz . With a TX power of 1 kW , this is a very difficult station to hear in Western Europe , even with a longwire . To catch this station in Crete , with a 22 cm antenna was incredible and it was at that point during my trip that I realised E-field antennas really can work superbly well for hard-core DXers on the move . <p> Upon my return to Oxford , I immediately started thinking about a DXpedition to the local woods I use for what I consider serious DXing . For obvious reasons , E-field antennas require an electrically quiet environment to ensure maximum SNR performance . In noisy environments , these types of antennas amplify the signal of interest and the background electro-smog , thus increasing signal levels but critically , not signal-to-noise . Fortunately , the Oxfordshire wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a 10 minute drive from my QTH as I sort of live in the countryside anyway and the QRM levels there are just about zero . Now , given that this was essentially an experiment to determine the best possible performance from the MA305 , I decided to use my best portable radio . It was quite tempting to pack up the Elad FDM DUO which running on a home-brew battery pack has proven itself to be my best ( pseudo ) portable radio . However , this is supposed to be a real-world test and in this type of scenario , DXpeditions with the Bonito antenna are much more likely to be undertaken with a portable radio . For these reasons I decided to conduct the test with the venerable Sony ICF-2001D . Having proven to be a superb receiver over many , many dxpeditions ( check out the evidence on my YouTube Channel Oxford Shortwave Log ) and still regarded by DXers as one of the best ever portable radios possibly the best it was the obvious choice . <p> I ventured out in early June around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car on the edge of the wood and proceeded to set up my cheap camera tripod , slightly modified to accept a 2 metre-long stainless steel tube , into which a slightly thinner 1 metre tube was mounted , topped off with my partially disassembled Selfie Stick which made it back from Crete lol . The antenna was set up in less than 5 minutes and approximately 4 metres above the ground much quicker and easier than de-spooling 100 metres of wire ! With fresh batteries in the Sony and the MA305 powered up using the USB power brick supplied by Bonito , I was ready to start listening . Almost immediately I heard and recorded a personal first ; Lao National Radio , Laos , signing on 6130 kHz , with an excellent signal . Hearing them in the UK was only made possible by the annual two week shut down of the PBS Xizang transmitter in Lhasa , Tibet , but hey , I 'll take it . A brilliant start to my listening session . <p> Over the next two hours I was amazed at what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind I have spent many hours at the woods previously , listening via various 100 metre longwires and a 200 metre Beverage , my expectations were , I thought , realistic in that the MA305 coupled to the Sony would catch some very good DX . However , I did believe there might be an absence of at least some of the more exotic low power stations on the Tropical Band afterall the MA305 is a very short antenna . Clearly I was wrong , because what transpired during the session surpassed anything I thought possible with this set-up . A list of reception videos follows below and further below , a selection of embedded videos . Some of the entries on this list simply stunned me at the time. - R+dio Educa++o Rural- for starters is such an incredibly difficult signal to hear in Europe , even with a very large antenna . Thus , to hear them on an ultra-compact set-up felt very special. - Radio Mali- is another station that is very difficult to catch with any modulation , except on a large antenna and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , - R+dio Nacional de Angola- and- Alcaravan Radio- are exotics that at best deliver very weak audio and most of the time no audio . Furthermore , the signals from- Emisoras Pio XII , - Myanmar Radio- and- R+dio Clube do Par+- were verging on what I would call superbId never heard anything like it previously except via 100 ( or more ) metres of wire . <p> So what 's next ? Well it would certainly be an interesting experiment to compare the performance of the MegActive antenna with the Wellbrook ALA1530 active loop in a similar environment . I have used the Wellbrook on DXpeditions several times , with often excellent results , however , its not designed to be portable and if SNR performance could be demonstrated as similar between these two products , given a very favourable price delta , the Bonito antenna would add up to be a very compelling purchase decision . More on that to come . In the meantime , thank you very much for **26;663;TOOLONG and I wish you all excellent DX . <p> Please click on the links below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel . 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Ok , so officially it was n't a DXpedition ; it was a well needed vacation in the sun after several hectic months of work , some of which involved travel to slightly more exotic locations . However , these days , I view any travel , whether it be for business or pleasure as a DXpedition opportunity ! Some of you might remember that I purchased a Bonito Boni Whip at the beginning of 2017 because ( a ) I needed another antenna and ( b ) a second Wellbrook loop felt like too much of an extravagance . Theyre excellent antennas for sure , but at around -300 , I could n't justify buying another . Thus , for about a third of the price I bought the Boni Whip . It proved to be an excellent choice very compact and so perfect for my regular DXpeditions , quick to set up and capable of really excellent DX . There are many videos on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel that are testament to this . I wrote a couple of articles , published here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bonito , who subsequently contacted me and offered to send over their MegActive MA305 E-field antenna for testing . Dennis made it crystal-clear that I was to do my own thingtest the antenna in any way I saw fit and publish my findings so DXers/radio enthusiasts could learn more about the capabilities of the antenna from another DXer . I was happy to agree to this arrangement and the MegActive MA305 duly arrived , complete with two lengths of ( bayonet BNC terminated ) high quality H-155 coaxial cable . <p> The specifications of the MegActive MA305 are very similar to the Boni Whip ; they both offer a Gain of +3 dBs , second and third order intercept points of greater than +30 and +50 dB respectively and both tune to 300 MHz . The MA305 is supplied with a longer radiating element and tunes down to 9 KHz ( versus the 20 kHz lower limit for the Boni Whip ) . Obviously this is n't a specification that is going to concern most radio enthusiasts ; both offer fantastically wide operating bandwidths . The way in which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are powered . The Boni Whip operates from 12 to 15 V , whilst the MA305 operates from 5 to 15 V. Bonitos design philosophy regarding this feature is based on- the increasing difficulty in procuring reasonably priced analogue external plug-in power supplies ( they are no longer allowed to be produced due to power consumption restrictions ) . <p> Interestingly , when the power supply for my Wellbrook ALA1530 packed up , I called them to purchase a replacement and was told they only have limited stocks remaining . Thus , a solution for powering active antennas with a suitable low-noise supply is an issue that needs resolving . The guys at Bonito figured a USB power source was suitably quiet and with USB power bricks almost ubiquitous these days for charging mobile phones and other portable electronic devices on-the-go , the idea could be applied to their active antennas . The result is the MegActive MA305 , designed to operate at 5 Volts with no loss of performance . As a DXer who probably spends more time listening on DXpeditions than I do in my shack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself often carry a cheap Chromebook laptop to use as an additional power source for my camera phone when Im DXing , so Bonitos design approach resonated with me completely . <p> - <h> Travelling with the MegActive MA305 <p> Ok , so the MA305 is very compact and very light indeed perfect for a trip to Crete ! However , I know from many conversations with my YouTube friends and followers that some of us feel a slight sense of trepidation carrying shortwave radios and antenna systems on board flights , be they national or international . I myself was n't really concerned other than if my bag got pulled from the X-ray machine , there 's often quite a long wait whilst the security staff work through the queue of luggage requiring erhuman intervention ! Predictably , my rucksack did get pulled and I waited patiently until it was my turn to explain the contents ! Looking back on this retrospectively , its hardly surprising . Other than the usual holiday paraphernalia , my rucksack contained : <p> A 10.0 metre length of H-155 coaxial cable <p> A 1.0 metre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MA305 Coaxial Power Inserter <p> MA305 Antenna Amplifier <p> Bonito USB Power Brick <p> Bonito USB Power Cable <p> NooElec RTL-SDR dongle <p> NooElect Ham It Up upconverter <p> Various screened cables and connectors <p> 10 metres of equipment wire <p> I explained to the ( friendly ) security chap that I was a shortwave radio hobbyist and identified the various pieces of equipment for him , as he removed them from my rucksack . He confirmed my X-ray had lit up ( in blue as it happens ) with metallic/electronic items and was even kind enough to swivel his monitor to show me the mess of items strewn across the screen just as I had thrown them all into my rucksack ! However , after quickly swabbing some of the items , he said all was fine and hoped that I enjoyed my holiday and listening . Service with a smile at Gatwick Airport and I was on my way . My outbound experience got me thinking whether it would be possible to pack my DXing kit in such a way that it would n't alarm airport security . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cables into my ( checked-in ) suitcase . I figured it would be obvious there was no security risk associated with cables alone . I then packed my RTL-SDR , upconverter and all of the MS305 components very neatly into a single box and put that in my carry-on rucksack . Now , some might argue that security measures at Heraklion International Airport in Crete differ a little from London Gatwick , but I observed staff at the X-ray machine very carefully monitoring every piece of luggage passing through it including my own and I passed straight through without a problem . All I did was take my laptop out as usual , and put it in a separate tray . Job done . <h> DXing with the MegActive MA305 <p> My apartment in Crete was on the second floor and a large balcony provided a decent outdoor location for DXing . As regards electrical noise , the location was much quieter than my shack at home , but it certainly was n't perfect , thus a good test of the MA305 in a real-world pseudo-urban environment . in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick and some tape and managed to construct a mount for the amplifier , increasing the overall height above ground by about 1.5 metres and displacing the radiating element an additional 2 metres thereabouts from the building . I 'm not sure whether it made much difference , but it seemed like the sensible thing to do for less than 10 Euros . <p> Despite hearing a lot of excellent DX whilst in Crete , there is one signal I copied , which more than any other , demonstrates the DXing credentials of the MA305 and Eton Satellit for that matter . In the early hours of the morning ( 00:59 hrs UTC ) I copied and recorded Radio Tarma from Peru on 4775 kHz . With a TX power of 1 kW , this is a very difficult station to hear in Western Europe , even with a longwire . To catch this station in Crete , at all , was incredible on an ultra-compact set-up .

Many more recordings are available on the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel and please do n't  hesitate to contact me if you require further information on the MA305 or the Eton Satellit .

You may have seen my previous post here , detailing some excellent initial DX results achieved with the Boni Whip . What makes this antenna so compelling for a DXer such as myself is simply that its so light and compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in a small flight case ( see above &amp; below ) on the back seat of my car , with either my Sony ICF-SW55 or Eton Satellit , a home-brew battery pack ( that literally cost pence ) and some peripheral bits and pieces ; spare batteries , cables etc . I think its probably already clear that if you consider the Boni Whips performance as a function of portability and price , its out there on its own Im not aware of another antenna that can match it . Of course , there are H-field antennas , such as the excellent Wellbrook active loops that will effectively reject QRM , if that 's an issue for the user , but at a significant cost delta . <p> - <p> Since my last posting , I have continued to use the Boni Whip regularly on my DXpeditions and upload the reception videos to my YouTube channel . I have been nothing but totally impressed with this antenna , to the point that I 've actually been surprised by- the signals Ive caught and recorded with it . Recent catches include a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sao Paolo , Radio Voz Missionaria Camboriu ( on the 49 and 31 metre broadcast bands ) and Radio Aparecida . Some of these signals are incredibly difficult to hear in Europe at all , let alone well and yet the ultra-compact Boni-Whip running off AA batteries , coupled to the ( equally brilliant ) Eton Satellit managed it with aplomb . Other catches include Zambia NBC Radio 1 Lusaka and a signal from Bangladesh Betar that sounded as if the transmitter was 5 miles down the road ! <p> All-in-all , I 'm extremely satisfied with the performance of the Bonito Boni Whip and highly recommend it to those DXers requiring a high-performance , compact antenna , for use at home in electrically quiet environments or on any DXpedition . You certainly wont be disappointed . <p> Please find embedded reception videos below and text links that will take you to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel . Thanks for **26;719;TOOLONG and I wish you all great DX . 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Hi there , back in 1990 I was given a Panasonic RF-B40 for my birthday ( I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I found that radio to be very sensitive on shortwave , more so perhaps than my Sangean ATS-803A , but ultimately it did n't  really add much value to any serious DXing because it would only tune on shortwave in 5 kHz steps . This rather course tuning arrangement was very limiting in terms of tuning out adjacent noise and copying tropical band and other signals that werent- quite on-frequency etc . Frustrated , I - lent my RF-B40 to my brother a few years ago and serves me right ; following a house move , he managed to lose it ! Quite a shame really because almost three decades later , I would have been very interested to put the RF-B40 through its paces on a DXpedition or two . You really do n't  see them in action very often at all these days . <p> At that time , which was around the beginning of the 1990s , I read a review somewhere and it became clear that the better receiver was quite obviously the RF-B65 . Upon its introduction into the market , the RF-B65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the intervening years its reputation has continued to grow to the point today where it enjoys legendary status amongst DXers and bit of a cult following . There 's a lot of information on the RF-B65 to be found on the internet , so I wont go into huge detail , but the obvious question is : what makes thsi receiver so special ? Well , its a quite compact PPL double conversion receiver , covering 153 kHz to 29,999 kHz AM and 87.5 to 108 MHz , FM . It has a keypad for direct frequency input , although you have to press either the FREQ or METER buttons prior to punching in the numbers to define whether you wish to access a particular frequency , or band . I actually find that slightly annoying , but you easily learn to live with such trivial matters when using a radio of this quality and performance . <p> Furthermore , there 's an electronic signal strength meter , a DX/local attenuation switch , external antenna jack , SSB reception mode , 1 kHz tuning steps on shortwave ( unlike its little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandwidth filter is 6 kHz wide and thus limits selectivity a little , although the SSB option and fine tune helps offset that somewhat . - It would have been nice to have a couple more filtering options , particularly narrower for serious DXing in crowded bands , to combat adjacent channel QRM . Build quality is generally excellent as you would have expected from a high-end Panasonic portable and with a very compact form-factor roughly the size of a paperback book and weighing in at just 1.4 Ibs , it is eminently more portable than a Sony ICF-SW77 or the iconic- ICF-2001D/2010 . <p> - <p> Ultimately , the RF-B65 continues to enjoy an excellent reputation today , nearly 30 years after it was introduced because it is a wonderfully- sensitive receiver and arguably the best-ever performing shortwave portable in the paperback book size category often touted as travel portables. - I managed to acquire an example in as-new condition from eBay , although mind you , I paid through the nose for it lol that cult following ensures prices remain very robust ! I have tested my example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to be the benchmark for shortwave portables , and in my experience the Panasonic is right up there with it . There 's virtually no difference whatsoever in sensitivity . Where the Panasonic comes a little unstuck is the lack of bandwidth filtering and SYNC , leading to lower selectivity . However , clever use of SSB and fine tuning does provide quite good- compensation for these shortcomings . Overall though , given its size , sensitivity , build quality and audio , as a complete package , in my opinion , the RF-B65 is- equal to the ICF-2001D , and this is why today , it remains so highly sought after . <p> Below are embedded reception videos and text links to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel , with various DX catches on the RF-B65 . Some of these are considered quite rare in Europe , for example EXPPM- Radio Educaci+ns 1 kW signal from Mexico City , the now defunct ABC Northern Territories on 120 metres and Radio Bandeirantes from Sao Paolo , Brazil , amongst others . Please note ; right at the bottom of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant Eton Satellit one of the very best portables currently on the market today . The vintage Panasonic holds its own , despite 30 years of supposed technical innovation in electronics . Thanks for **26;747;TOOLONG and I wish you all great DX . 42385 @qwx662385 <p> Hi there , its been about three weeks now since I started DXing with the Eton Satellit and I thought it time to post an updated review , based on my experiences thus far , along with some recent catches . Noting that other radio hobbyists with a strong presence online have been posting neutral to negative reviews on this receiver , I would just like to point out , perhaps rather obviously , that no receiver is perfect and just as importantly , the criteria on which a portable radio is judged will be different from user to user , based on their listening habits . I am- almost exclusively engaged in DXing with the Satellit , whilst others will be listening on the broadcast bands on a more casual basis . I know that for some , the ultimate quality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would make their- physical assessment in a very detailed manner . I on the other hand focus mainly on performance and as regards quality , I 'm reasonably satisfied if it does n't  fall apart in my hands , straight out of the box ! That actually happened and its sort of where I draw the line = I guess the point is , I try to respect everyones opinion , irrespective as to whether we are in agreement or not and I believe that 's healthy for the future of our hobby . <p> Ok , back to the Satellit . Firstly , I am able to confirm that in terms of ultimate sensitivity , this portable is very close to my Sony ICF-2001D one of the most highly regarded portables ever made . The delta in performance between the two is most- perceptible on the weakest of fading signals that intermittently deliver audio with the Sony , but ca n't be heard on the Eton . On stronger signals , my experience is that either radio might provide the- strongest and or highest fidelity audio . I have a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uploaded to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel soon . <p> In terms of selectivity , the digital bandwidth filters work very well , although I note that even on the narrowest setting ( 2 kHz ) when operating in a crowded band , adjacent channel QRM can occasionally- still sound quite pronounced , as compared to my Sony ICF-SW55 or ICF-2001D receivers . As regards synchronous detection , this is more of a hit-and-miss affair . Subscribers to my channel might notice that in nearly all of my reception videos featuring- the Eton Satellit , I have not engaged the SYNC . That is n't to say it does n't  work , however , even with selectable sidebands , the SYNC mode often appears to increase the overall signal amplitude and noise floor , without positively influencing- the SNR . However , its interesting to note that- signals on the Satellit in AM mode often almost match- the ICF-2001D in SYNC mode , in terms of overall SNR . More on that to come . <p> There are a number of ways to tune the radio ; manually using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to it ) , direct frequency input which requires pressing the AM button to engage , automatic search and access to 700 memory locations , via 100 screen pages . In the real world and by that I mean my world which is most often in the middle of a field , or the woods , all of the above tuning options are as ergonomic as most of my- other portables . With regard to SSB reception , there are fast , slow and fine tuning options with a maximum resolution of 10 Hz and this works very well to reproduce natural sounding speech in LSB and USB modes . The tuning speed/fine options are engaged by pressing the tuning knob inwards towards the set quite a neat idea . With SSB and SYNC there 's always a little pause whilst the electronics engage a set of chevrons appear on the screen to indicate the receiver is actually doing something . Its similar to the Sony ICF-SW77 where you effectively- toggle between SYNC USB and LSB and wait for lock . Not an issue for me , but it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICF-2001D , where SYNC engagement is instantaneous , if the signal is of sufficient strength . A small point , but worth making . <p> - <p> So , overall , a brilliant little radio that in my opinion is completely worthy of the Satellit branding , at least in terms of ultimate performance . As I mentioned previously , one of the most experienced DXers I know , with more than 3 decades of listening to the HF bands and an owner of a number of vintage Satellit receivers noted that the Eton Satellit outperformed them and by some margin . To further demonstrate this , I have included links to recent reception videos . In particular , I copied three- of the regional AIR stations with signal strength and clarity that had never previously been obtained . I also copied HM01 , the Cuban Numbers Station for the first time on the 11 metre broadcast band , Sudan and Guinea on the 31 metre broadcast band ( a whopping signal from Guinea ) and Polski Radio 1 on longwave . I hope you find them interesting . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my subscribers have purchased this radio and thus far have been very happy indeed with its performance . <p> Ultimately , I have to strongly recommend this portable to anyone interested in DXing and in particular those that embark on DXpeditions . I just hope that should you decide to buy one , you receive an example that performs was well as mine . Embedded reception videos and text links follow below , In the mean time and until my next post , I wish you all great DX ! 42385 @qwx662385 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207400 @3907400/ <h> Australian code breakers in World War II <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , Ian P , for sharing the following from the radio program , - ABC Overnights : <h> The crucial role of Australian code breakers in World War 2 <p> Thanks to the recent film , The Imitation Game , you may be familiar with the story of how British intelligence , led by mathematician Alan Turing , cracked Nazi codes during WW2 . Did you know there were also two secret organisations in Australia working to break Japans military codes ? <p> These were staffed with brilliant cryptographers , including some who had studied mathematics and the classics , and others who had lived or grown up in Japan . By patiently and carefully unravelling the codes in Japanese signals , their intelligence played a crucial role in the battles of Midway and the Coral Sea , as well as the push into the Philippines . <p> Trevor Chappell interviews Craig Collie , author of the book Code Breakers Inside the Shadow world of Signals Intelligence in Australias two Bletchley Parks . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II " <p> here 's a dose of reality . In the case of the Germans vs the rest of us , a new scrambled code became more &amp; more frequent . This code break became one of the greatest " Win or Lose " factors at this point in WWII ! <p> Interesting converation about the Japanese code-breaking from an Australian perspective . In the end it was the arrogance of the political and military leadership of both Japan and Germany that led to their codes being broken . Their superiority complex refused to admit the evidence like the Yamamoto shoot-down and kept them from acting on what certainly some of their own experts told them . The Allied democracies , in contrast , were much more open to dissenting opinions . Its a lesson we may have to learn again in todays world . <p> Mr. Chappell provides some interesting and previously unknown insights into the widely dispersed Allied signals intelligence network active in the Pacific during WWII . Here are a few additional facts regarding the shoot-down of Admiral Yamamoto . The original message , NTF131755 , addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th Air Flotilla , and the 26th Air Flotilla , was encoded in the Japanese Naval Cipher JN-25D ( Naval Operations Code Book of the third version of RO ) , and was picked up by three stations of the " Magic " apparatus , including Fleet Radio Unit Pacific Fleet . Operation " Vengeance " was the flight of twelve P-38 Lightning twin engine fighters sent to shoot down the " Betty " bomber that carried Admiral Yamamoto . Four P-38s found Yamamotos plane . Chappell mistakenly refers to these aircraft as " bombers " . As an aside , my Dad served as a fleet radioman in the Pacific during the first three years of the war . He said it it was very easy to find some Japanese code transmissions while at sea because unlike the Allied signals the Japanese transmissions were MCW . I suspect MCW was used for relatively local traffic . <p> So its a regular AM transmitter , with an audio oscillator that can be keyed that feeds the microphone jack . <p> There 's no technical advantage , but its not efficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but over distance , CW would carry further . So it does n't  make sense . Cheap license free walkie talkies often had a button for sending MCW , and hams have used it to send morse code practice sessions on VHF , where the average ham would only have an AM or later FM receiver . <p> No , not specifically . But I assume he monitored all frequencies and modes except radar as he served mostly on destroyers . In addition to screening the aircraft carrier(s) destroyers were frequently sent after downed pilots . The only frequency specialists on board were what my Dad called the " radar boys " who did not handle communications . Dad served on the Gridley DD-380 which had full fleet communications and cipher capability . It was equipped to provide full back-up communications for the flagship : USS Enterprise , if needed . <p> Code Breakers is also available NOW on Kindle if you go to the Australian Amazon store ( . yes , we have an Amazon online outlet now , too ! ) . The link LONG ... I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Australia ( there may be territorial restrictions placed on this ) , but perhaps worth a try . You 'll notice that there are a number of books available using the title " Code Breakers " ( or similar ) , so be sure you 're selecting the one by Craig Collie . Happy reading ! <p> Never to March , never to be mentioned . Since the end of the Second World War , many thousands of returned service personnel have marched at Anzac Day services throughout Australia . My father never marched . <p> My father served in RAAF No 4 Wireless Unit , Central Bureau . Central Bureau was under the direct command of General Douglas MacArthur , and was set up to detect , record , and translate all messages transmitted by Japanese forces in the Pacific . <p> Central Bureau was headquartered in Brisbane , but its Wireless Units worked in the field , moving forward with MacArthur , constantly intercepting and decyphering enemy messages . As the war progressed , the units became so efficient in their work that they were monitoring all enemy radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the messages reached their intended destination . The Wireless Units served throughout the Pacific islands providing vital information about enemy strengths and positions . RAAF No 4 Wireless Unit was formed as a highly mobile unit , and served at Hollandia , Morotai , Labuan Island , and at Luzon , Philippines . The U.S. High Command highly praised the Wireless Units of Central Bureau , stating that their work effectively shortened the War in the Pacific by at least two years . <p> At the end of the war , Central Bureau was dismantled . All personnel signed a lifetime secrecy order to not speak of their wartime activities . No promotions applied . No evidence of their Central Bureau service was recorded , including overseas service . No medals were struck . Family members , including children , were not told in any detail , of their fathers war experience . <p> It was only in the late 1990s that the Australian government allowed information to be released . In the early 1960s , my father mysteriously went on an unexplained visit to Brisbane . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he attended a twenty-year anniversary of his units graduation . I write this on behalf of the children and grandchildren of those Central Bureau personnel that served diligently and efficiently when called upon , and who , when the job was done , quietly went home . They are our heroes . <p> I 'm not sure of the correctness of this however I have heard a number of claims by Australian signal men that Japanese radio traffic was intercepted if I remember correctly in Western Australia regarding an imminet attack on Pearl Harbour or on American Pacific assets . Supposedly this was priority passed to Australian high command and on to the British who at a very top level either deliberately dithered or withheld the info for the reasonage of bring the Americans into the war due th their hitherto isolationist position . Churchill was struggling to obtain US support at this time . Obviously this would be kept very quiet and denied afterwoods by the British . Has any one else heard of this . <p> I have read a number of variations of this hypothesis , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the best tool is understanding what Japanese codes were broken by December 1941 . The Purple code or diplomatic code was broken by this time but these messages would not have included military information which was kept secret from the Japanese diplomatic services . JN25 , the family of Japanese naval codes was put into use in in 1939 and was updated every 3-6 months . Each update required fresh code cracking . Prior to December 1941 only 10% of JN25 was known . JN25b was used beginning on December 4 , 1941 . This code was broken sufficiently by May of 1942 to provide warning of the attack on Midway . The Japanese carrier task force left Japan for Pearl Harbor on November 26 and maintained strict radio silence . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

By default intelligent lighting is on ( i.e. any control will turn the light on for a short period of time ) but with this feature you can disable that so that the light will only come on when you specifically turn it on . ( This ability to disable intelligent lighting is also on the PL-660 and certain other Tecsun radios . ) <p> Tecsun PL-880 is like a grab bag ! . Pressing ( and hold ) 4 will toggle between " ON " and " OFF " , .. but I do n't  know what this really do ! , .. I wonder if anybody know something about it ? I have n't found this feature on the " Complete list of Tecsun PL-880 hidden features " Thanks and 73s ! <p> Just received my 880 from Anon-co yesterday and have been playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture date is 140430 . Pressing the " 6 " key yields no result but pressing the " 4 " turns some feature ON and OFF . Pressing " 9 " only allows adjustment of muting threshold when I am in the FM mode . If I am in AM or SSB , nothing happens . I 've not listened long or well enough to know if DNR or muting adjustment works , but access points are in different places than listed here . <p> Well , discovered what " 4 " was for . Just reading the above posts would have helped ! Geesh . Anyway , " 6 " does not turn on DNR in any mode or status that I can find . After holding down the key for a while , the numeral " 6 " comes up and then disappears and the frequency reappears . So , DNR is n't available in my radio and from listening to the effect on a few videos , I 'm not missing anything . Since the yahoo group no longer exists , is there another forum to share information ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual function . With power off , it sets the low battery voltage . With power on , it evidently enables the DNR and soft mute functions of keys 6 and 9 . That is what I think is going on . <p> If you press and hold the 4 key ( with the power ON ) on a recent release Tecsun PL-880 , it will toggle to " On " , and you can now use the 6 and 9 keys as described for the DNR and soft mute . If you press and hold the 4 key again ( with the power ON ) until it says " Off " , pressing and holding the 4 or 6 keys ( with the power ON ) will then do nothing . The firmware on my radio still shows 8820 , but something has changed . Whether it is a hardware revision , or a firmware revision , I do n't  know . The SSB performance is also greatly improved on this most recent sample , leading me to believe there have been hardware changes ( for the better ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to correct the description , it say now : Now press the key #9 to display the squelch value . " It should say " Now press the key #9 for more than 2 seconds to display the squelch value .. " <p> I plan on purchasing a Tensun PL-880 in the very near future . I would really appreciate it If I could be kept in the loop of incoming blogged comments from others who currently own this radio and are discovering " new " features that they would like to share with other radio enthusiasts to better help them obtain the maximum benefit from this neat new offering from Tecsun . <p> I 've owned the Tecsun Pl-880 Firmware Version 8820 Manufacture Date 140430 about 6 months . I discovered another hidden feature but do n't  know what it means ? With the POWER OFF press the page + button for 3 seconds and a display of 1001 on the screen .

Do you know any other hidden possibilities except those that are known by all ? <p> The backlight stays off when the volume control is adjusted , whether the radio is on or off . The backlight will come on for three seconds with radio on or off when either tuning or fine tuning is adjusted , or any button is pressed . This assumes the light switch is in the auto off position . <p> I 've just ordered a PL880 , now in the mail . I am impatient to open the packet and all the secret packages inside .. Looks like there is no end to it = No wonder its supposed to be a good radio , keeps you busy 24/7 .. I 'm really interested in its SSB reception . So I 'll try to keep this post informed .

In the second case , hours , minutes and days of work in general . <p> Hi everyone . I would like your help . A friend of mine and me have bought two Tecsun PL-880 . There is something strange . i ) The signal meter is supposed to measure up to 99dBu ( my PL-390 tecsun s-meter goes up to 95-97dBu for very strong amateur signals in my area included mine in mw zone ) . The point is that for both devices ( mine and my friends are 8820 firmware ) the signal meter does not exceed 85 dBu and in particular my tecsun PL-880 signal meter does not goes over 70dBu ( ie. even lower measurement ) . Why this behaviour ? ii ) Another strange point is that my friends tecsun receiver displays for a " quiet " frequency ( mw ) a noise level of about 10-12dBu , while my tecsun device shows only 2-3dBu noise ( same frequency and same spot ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 ) and worked a bit but with minor results in sensitivity , especially for my tecsun PL-880 receiver . Is it possible to adjust the noise level so that it can be 10-12dBu instead of being only 2-3dBu and hence better sensitivity ? And is it possible to adjust the maximum signal level ( 99dBu instead of 85dBu or even worse 70dBu for miy device ) ? ? Thanking you in advance . <p> Mine does that when trying to go lower than 3120. figured its some kind of limit built in.mine is made this year so surely has latest firmware.how old is yours brian l. ? So far in happy with mine.my house has metal roof and siding so I have a 50 ' and a 30 ' wires outdoors for antennas.however took mine for a walk yesterday outdoors and amazing how well it does out of my house on the stick antenna <p> Hi Robert . thanks for your reply to my question Tecsun PL-880 and its 3 Mhz direct input limit from the key-pad . Mine also is current 8820 , so it looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limit ; that 's a little odd ! but otherwise , I am highly pleased with this radio , so much that I recently sold my Icom IC-R75 to have portability , and reduce my clutter from external power supply and speaker , plus other tuned low frequency aerial-antenna . <p> I see your use a long-wire aerial-antenna ; that should bring in a hell of a signal , due the receivers very good sensitivity across the HF band . I use a homebrew small magnetic balanced loop , H-Field type , due living in a small flat here in Jersey the Channel Islands , between France and England the UK lots of QRN-M noise , so magnetic aerial-antenna is the only way to go and provides some directional reduction of QRN-M . <p> Thanks again for confirming this 3Mhz limit , its good to know I am not the only one . <p> Hey anytime brian , I like the size for what it does . Where I live , the 30 ' wire works best some days , others the 50 ' is better . I just wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can live with it like it is <p> Hi Robert regarding the charge rate , it seems fixed as such , but you can reduce the battery low voltage shutdown level e.g. from 3.7 to 3.4 so , with the radio OFF , press and hold key 4 until display shows voltage , then adjustment via tuning knob to lowest voltage , and then press 4 again , to save the setting . <p> I did this , and it gives some extra useable time ; but also decided to buy larger battery capacity for the radio and my aerial-antenna loop design ; as I was powering it remotely and stepping up the 3V7 to 12 volt . It worked out fine giving many months of antenna use , the radio if used daily provides a good week or a little more . <p> The ones I used are re-badged Panasonic with protection cut-out and over charge : 18650 type by Foxnovo 2.600mA or 9.6Wh , also purchased the charger unit too , model : F-2 this gives a full charge within two hours or less Amazon UK but USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , just wondered about speeding charge up.its ok though as I just alternate batterys every other day n keep 1 fully charged all the time . But all in I 'm very happy with my 880. glad I did n't  go with the sangean 909 . I do n't  like the clicks on the tune wheel , and crom what Ive read a 880 outperforms a 909 for less money <p> Ah-yes Robert , battery exchange is a good way to go as for the Sangean ATS-909X , its a little deaf signal wise , and some individuals have hacked the tune knob to remove the clicks I had this radio some years ago , a nice look and layout but , also had an odd lock-up with the DSP , that set a low filter band-pass when changing frequencies ; this required powering down and up again . The Tecsun PL-880 is far FAR better receiver , well worth its money even with the odd direct input 3Mhz frequency limit , and with un-official key tweaks provides a more personal preference for ones listening pleasure . 73s <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 63 and dials down to 30. another squelch setting . 30 hides weak stations 63 opens them up . Its simular to pressing 9 but coveres both am and fm . Almost 2 months and lots of hours on my radio , I 'm very satisfied with it.some day we will find all the hidden features . <p> I have found another hidden feature , unless I have not noticed any other comment about it . <p> The display light bulb on my PL-880 went out . By chance I looked at a photo of an earlier Tecsun model and under the " 5 " button was the word " light " , this is not printed on the PL-880 but I gave it a try . <p> Turn the radio off . Press and hold " 5 " , it will toggle between on and off . Switch it to on . Turn the radio on . Bulb will light up , subject to the position of the usual " on or auto " position of the switch on the right hand side of the radio . <p> Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only found it by luck . Why is there no printing under the button or no instructions given ? If I have failed to spot this information before now then please correct me . <p> I call my 880 a mystery radio , many hidden features , but i realy like mine.dont know why my keyboard messed up but otherwise its great.just hope they last like my yacht boy 400 pe did.it was used hard and was 1 of the first pes universal sold <p> I have a PL-880 for approx 2 yrs . All of sudden I can not hear the mw band . All I get is loud static which is loud enough to vibrate the radio off the desk . I will appreciate any advise . The FM Band is ok . <p> Hello , i bought a PL-880 from anon-co , product day 07/2016 . Unfortunately the signal strength meter goes until 44 even in very strong signals . For me that is a problem , can we do something for that . Thank you in advance . <p> Great hidden feature sheet ( Troy Riedel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though in the row for Additional Features the instructions explain how to use the synchronous detection toggle .

A lot of emails , however , are from listeners who wish to improve the performance of their portable radios . <p> One of the first things I suggestespecially if they 're hearing a lot of interference noise on the radiois simply to unplug the AC- adapter ( a.k.a. , " wall wart " ) - and run the portable off batteries . Why ? - Quite often , those wall warts are injecting a lot of noise into your receiver .

When I buy a new portableone that I plan to keep after reviewing on SWLing.comI invest in twice the number of rechargeable batteries that the portable holds . For example , my Sony ICF-SW7600GR operates on 4 AA cells , thus I bought a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always have an extra set of charged batteries available when I deplete those in the unit . <p> There are three main types of rechargeables available : NiCd ( nickel cadmium ) , Lithium Ion , and NiMH ( nickel-metal hydride ) .

I have brought nearly dead NiMH batteries back to life with this wonderful machine . <p> Like batteries , not all chargers are created equal . You should opt for a higher-quality , NIMH-specific charger . Ideally , since most radios require 3-4 batteries at a time , purchase a charger that will hold at least 4 batteries . <p> You can see that I 'm very fond of the Maha brand battery chargers , though there are other good chargers on the market . Maha receives high praise from many amateur radio operators , and I 've had excellent luck with them , too . What I especially like about the Maha/Powerex company is that they focus all of their innovation in the area of batteries and charging systems for a wide variety of uses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced you yet ? Do n't  even bother unpacking the AC adapter that comes with your radio ! - You do n't  really need it . - " But wait , " you may be thinking , " my radio has a built-in battery charger , so do n't  I need my AC adapter ? " Even if your radio has a built-in battery charging function , its probably very basic and should only be used if you have no other option . Many of these are prone to over- or under-charge batteries , and take hours to complete this relatively simple task . <p> Trust me : - your portable shortwave reciever will perform at its best when powered by quiet , rechargeable NiMH batteries charged properly with a good-quality charger . Try it , and hear for yourself . <h> 8 thoughts on " Throw away AC adapters , invest in rechargeables " <p> There 's another good reason to run your portable using batteries . If you 're using a computer to decode digital signals , or to record what you 're hearing , there is far less noise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio is not connected to the AC mains . I do n't  know if this is because noise on the AC is making it into the radios audio output socket , or if there 's some sort of ground loop effect happening ( because the connection between radio and computer means the entire system now has two separate paths to ground ) but switching the radio to batteries makes the audio much better . <p> I have used NIMH , however I currently use Enloop ready to use rechargeables , along with the Maha-C808M which charges D , C , AA &amp; AAA . I too keep a portable Maha charger just for traveling ( MH-C401FS ) which can be used from the wall , or accessory outlets in most vehicles . The whole solar thing however is a problem as most chargers just do n't  have practical charging characteristics . If needed , just plug a solar panel/controller into your vehicle outlet to keep the battery or batteries charged up , then charge your portable batteries at will . For those situations when you need total portable operation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Anker Mobile Power battery ( Model 79AN20L ) a Li-polymer battery ( 20000mAh/74Wh ) . It comes with a wall &amp; vehicle plugin , and can be charged with a suitable solar panel/controller allowing stand alone portable power with outputs of DC 12/16/19 volts , and a 5 volt USB outlet it will provide virtually any portable power need . As to the new 3.7 volt cells now obviously beginning to be used , as well as the now common 3.0 volt ( CR123A ) batteries , found in many flashlights today Rechargeables like those found in the new Tecsun , and rechargeables ( such as the 3.0 V Tenergy RCR123A ) along with respective chargers will fit right in . Yes the Tecsuns with USB plugs can be run/charged from all battery options ( vehicle/Ankers ) giving complete flexibility and low/no noise like wall-warts do . Besides , it causes many appreciative looks in places like Starbucks when you sit down with your chosen beverage In the padded seats far from the crowds surrounding the available ( over-used wall outlets ) and just plug into your small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small go-bag ) . The looks on their faces is priceless . Not to mention the friends you make by offering a spare USB port for empty smartphones. = <p> For home use , the batteries only last about 9 hours , making recharging a constant chore I 'd rather avoid . I find the best thing for the ac adapter is a snap on ferrite core . It does n't  get rid of all of the powerline noise , but most of it . Most of the common ones have enough attenuation down to a few mhz if the wire is wrapped around the ferrite a few times , counts as three turns . Most of the cheap switching mode adapters on Ebay and elsewhere produce a ton of rfi no ferrite will block enough of it , avoid them at all costs and stick with transformer based ones . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207404 @3907404/ <h> Update : Sangean ATS-405 review <p> After publishing my initial review of the Sangean ATS-405- on July 25 , I- contacted Sangean and requested a sample radio for comparison purposes . Back story : - there were some receiver performance issues that I suspected- may have been tied to my particular ATS-405 unit . Sangean- kindly dispatched another ATS-405 which I received last- week . The following is an update to my initial ATS-405 review . <p> In truth , there were two main reasons I wanted another unit to compare to my initial review radio : <p> I wanted to see if the new- unit showed improved performance " sensitivity , selectivity , and , specifically , noise floor " in- comparison- with- the first review unit tested <p> I noted strong DSP " birdies " ( noises ) on 800 and 1600 kHz on the test model , while- several of our readers commented that their 405s- did not feature- birdies <h> Shortwave sensitivity/selectivity and noise <p> I noted in my initial review that the initial ATS-405 had an ever-present noise , a sort of low-volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly seemed to be higher than other comparable shortwave portables , and was most noticeable when- tuned to marginal/weak stations . I suspect many listeners may not notice it unless they compare it with other portables . <p> Fortunately , my new review units noise floor seems to be slightly lower than that of my initial review unit . Perhaps this units- board is better soldered " ? The noise is still there , but can be better mitigated by judiciously using narrow filters and the three-position audio tone control . <p> I suspect this is a noise somewhere in the audio amplification chain , because I find it less noticeable with headphones , and more pronounced via the ATS-405s internal speaker . <p> In terms of sensitivity and selectivity on the shortwave bands , - I believe my new unit is identical to that of the initial review unit . That is to say , the ATS-405 is not an especially- sensitive shortwave receiver , but- fairly average , and thus will- fit the bill for most- but not for the discriminating weak-signal hunter . - Frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling in weak stations . <p> I 've tried tinkering with the AGC settings and soft mute " very cool features ! " in an attempt- to improve sensitivity , but alas , these only help the quality and stability of the received signal . <h> Birdies <p> Immediately after opening the box of the new ATS-405 sample , I popped in a fresh set of AA batteries and tuned the Sangean to 1600 kHz AM . If you read my initial review , I noted- a strong DSP birdie on 1600 and ( to a lesser degree ) on 800 kHz . <p> At first listen , I was happy to note that the new unit lacks the wild DSP noise that overwhelmed my favorite local station on 1600 kHz . <p> As I listened more carefully , though , I did note a metronomic " chick " sound that was also present but partially buried in the noise on my initial ATS-405 . <p> Listening to these samples , I realize I may have had the filter set to the middle position on the first sample and the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> To further demonstrate the difference between the two , I made this short video ; I start with my initial review unit , then switch to the new review unit provided by Sangean : <p> Note that this was recorded at least 100 feet from my house on the tailgate of my pickup truck . DSP birdies on 800 kHz sounded very much like the 1600 kHz sample , save the noise level on the latter is slightly lower and there are- no broadcast stations in the background . <p> None of my other portables have- digital noises or birdies on 800 and 1600 kHz . <p> So , - the bad news : - I do still hear a noticeable ( and slightly annoying ) internally-generated noise on the new review unit . The good news : - it is n't as objectionable- as that on my initial review unit . <h> Summary <p> While the new 405 review sample seems to perform better than the initial 405 sample , - I find the discrepancy somewhat marginal , especially since I spend the bulk of my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan of production runs where units vary so greatly- from one to another , making accurate testing difficult . Therefore its quite possible you might- receive a unit that performs better than those I testedbut unfortunately , the opposite is also true . <p> So , if you 're a Sangean fan , if you do n't  mind the birdies on mediumwave , and if you mostly listen to strong shortwave stations , you may- entertain purchasing an ATS-405 . The keypad layout is almost identical to previous Sangean models . <p> To be clear , of course , - this radios negatives above have been viewed under a microscope ; the ATS-405 is not a " bad " receiver , its just not that exceptional . Other than the added mute/AGC/squelch features , when compared to its predecessors , its really not a better iteration . <p> Well , my experience s now that I got 6 weeks under the belt , its overpriced . Yes , it has flaws , but so do the Tecsun low-end DSPs . As far as SW not being a main concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just a handful of SW-BCs pointed at us . Even the BeeB no longer BCs to us . CRI , RRI , RNZI , R.Aus , R. Hav. is about it . <p> If this were a US$50-75 set , I can see its place .. as an improvement over the low-end Tecsuns . But in this price range , there 's better , and not necessarily DSP , there 's still a few good PLLs. 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207405 @3907405/ <h> Southgate ARC : What Is a Balun and How to Make One Cheaply <h> Ham Radio What Is a Balun and How to Make One Cheaply <p> A Balun is a transformer which allows coaxial cable , which is an unbalanced lead to be connected to a balanced load , for example a resonant aerial . <p> The 1:1 balun is often called a choke balun , it works by eliminating Radio Frequency currents flowing on the outside of your coaxial cable , this is important because it prevents the pattern of the dipole becoming distorted and prevents the braid of the coaxial cable radiating . <p> Connecting coax to your resonant dipole which can be configured in a V shape or in a sloping fashion , however serious power loss and feeder radiation can occur without the use of a balun transformer . No one wants to induce Radio Frequency currents into Television receivers or Broadcast equipment as it may result in disputes with neighbours and could possibly lead to your station having to close down . Try to keep the centre of your aerial away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring . <p> Building a choke is not difficult all you need is some plastic pipe available from many Do It Yourself outlets and warehouses . I use a length of about 1 foot of plastic pipe and 21 feet of coaxial cable , the length of the pipe and diameter is chosen because it works well if using R-G-5-8 coax the ends of the pipe can be sealed after placing a SO-239 connector for your coaxial lead . I use two bolts and solder tags at the other end of the pipe to connect the ends of the dipole to the choke . <p> When wrapping your coax around the pipe do n't  use too much force as it may damage the inner braid and space the turns away from each other by a millimetre or two . R-G-2-1-3 coax around 21 feet used with 5 inch pipe will handle 400 watts pf power . Wire ties can be used to hold the turns together along the length of the pipe . Using these measurements your choke will cover all of the ham radio bands from 1.8 Megahertz through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Using a dummy load connected to the choke and transmitting 100 watts from my transmitter indicated an S.W.R. readings of around 1.5 to 1 at 3.5 Megahertz when testing 28 Megahertz the S.W.R. reading came down to 1.1 to 1 which is an excellent match . Using the choke as it should be at the feed point of a dipole cut for 40 metres give an S.W.R. reading of 1.2 to 1 . The highest reading was 1.5 to 1 when using 18 Megahertz but the rest of the High frequency bands gave me very acceptable matching . <h> One thought on " Southgate ARC : What Is a Balun and How to Make One Cheaply " <p> Baluns and un-uns are a fascinating subject ! I have n't explored the coax versions yet ; I 've been working with toroids , especially binocular ones for both transmit and receive .

@@75207412 @3907412/ <p> Hi there , if like me , you live in an urban environment , chances are QRM is having a negative impact on the quality of the signals you 're receiving at home . The presence of electrical noise makes antenna choice very important , particuarly if you 're planning to spend more than a few ---s on something more sophisticated than a length of wire . Recently I was considering the the purchase of a second compact antenna , for use at home in my shack and out and about on DXpeditions . I already had the excellent Wellbrook ALA1530 H field antenna , but at more than -250 , its- very costly and thus it seemed rather- extravagent to buy a second one , if I could find something with similar performance for less expense . Space is at a premium at home and of course I take much of my equipment out on DXpeditions , so the Bonito Boni whip active antenna appeared to be an ideal choice . A wideband active antenna ( from 20 kHz to 300 MHz ) operating from 12 to 15V DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes . Furthermore , with reasonable second and third order intercept points of +55 and +32.5 dBm respectively , the Boni whip , on paper at least , looked like a pretty good buy at around -100 . <p> - <p> Now , clearly , an E field antenna such as the Boni whip is not going to match the SNR provided by the- H field Wellbrook ALA1530 in a noisy , urban environment . I have uploaded a few reception videos to my YouTube channel to demonstrate this , making a direct comparison of the two . However , what about the performance of the whip versus a simple longwire in an urban environment ? Is there a delta in performance ? The value proposition of the whip is primarliy in its performance , coupled with portability I suppose , but that must be considered a secondary requirement . The whip might be 10 or 15 times more expensive than a reel of cheap equipment wire , but will the reception justify the cost delta ? ! <p> Text links follow directly below , with embedded videos thereafter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 30 metre longwire , on- shortwave and one each for LW and MW. - At the end of each video there 's a section with the Wellbrook loop , just to calibrate where the longwire and whip are in terms of a much more effective H field antenna . The result ? Well , there 's not much to separate the longwire and Boni whip , except on LW , where the whip prevails . A friend told me recently , if reception is rubbish at home under a blanket of QRM , do n't  blame the antenna , the noise is the real problem . He was right . So , the next tests are to be undertaken out in the field , where the whip has a real chance to shine . I 'm rooting for it because to have an antenna that performs as well as , or close to my loop out in the woods , yet can be packed away into a small case would be brilliant .

Think of it after 50 or 60 years , these fine examples of radio history can still be found , complete with their original boxes , shipping crates , manuals and accessories . <p> We have seen a number of these in recent years . Several years ago , a Panasonic RF-9000 , one of the Holy Grails of radio collecting , appeared on Ebay , in new opened box condition . As rare as that was , its even rarer to find tube or solid state communications receivers from the 1950s and 1960s . Such is the case with National HRO-500s , which were considered high level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-1960s . <p> In 2016 , a seller in California advertised a great rarity a HRO-500 that he said he purchased in 1967 , complete with its original shipping crate . <p> It was said to be in new/unopened condition , which of course raises concerns about the unit itself since it has never been used since leaving the factory . While that radio apparently sold ( the asking price was $2500 ) , I was astounded to recently see another HRO-500 . It was not in New/Unopened condition , but the closest one comes to it . Among a collection purchased by the seller , the radio was in its original crate , inside of which was the original box with the original National Radio Co fabric cover , with original strips of fiberglass insulation . The manual is still in its plastic wrap . <p> I decided to do a video for SWLing Post readers , and provide some still shots , as this time capsule of radio history was opened ( this was likely only the 2nd or 3rd time it was opened since leaving the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ebay ad . <p> The good news many HRO-500s on the used market exhibit failure of the PLL lock circuit . While the PLL lock light on this particular radio does not light up , its PLL does operate on every band . This radio arrived with one metal cap for the MODE knob missing , so I 'll be searching for a spare . And the dial calibration clutch knob appears to be frozen , another minor issue that does not impact operation of the radio . <p> All in all , this was a fantastic find and I hope SWLing Post readers enjoy the video and stills : <h> Video <h> Photos <p> The National HRO-500 is a gorgeous radio and it looks like you 've got a prime specimen .

I 'm not sure how beneficial the electrical properties of the fence were , probably somewhere between not great and not good lol , but some pretty decent DX was had with the PL-310ET attached to it via the external antenna socket and a crocodile clip ! <p> The barbed wire fence extends almost to the treeline on the horizon ; about 240 metres <p> I hope you enjoy this set of reception videos , they certainly help to demonstrate the great performance of the PL-310ET and in addition of course , its ability to handle large antennas quite well .

Now the only question remains : - can you actually make- impulse purchases on Kickstarter ? I think I just proved that you can . <p> OK , I bought in . I hope this is better than WiFi radios I 've had in the past . They have been unreliable , losing connection and requiring frequent restarting . I expect the audio to be quite good , at least on par with the Tivoli . I hope that advances in the streaming technology and the fact that my internet speeds are very high and my router is improve , will combine to take away the frustration I experienced in the past . <p> The Como Audio radios will be using VTuner as their Internet station aggregator , according to founder Tom DeVestos July 7th post in the comments section of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller library of stations and streaming programs ( " Tens of thousands of stations " ) versus what Tunein offers ( " TuneIn has over 100,000 real ( broadcast ) radio stations and four million on-demand programs and podcasts from around the world .

@@75207433 @3907433/ <h> Tag Archives : Digital Modes Reference Guide <p> Some 20 years ago , Mike Chace-Ortiz , Stan Skalsky , myself and a bunch of other folks put together a FAQ about digital modes on radio specifically modes going from LW way up into the UHF spectrum- called the DigiFAQ 5.3 . I was responsible for the HF Software section , and as you might know , back then it was all about the hardware . InfoTech was still around , and amateur digital modes using the PK232 were plentiful . There is a PDF-based copy on the UDXF website click here to download . <p> Now jump ahead 20 years or so , and things have changed considerably . Hardware is no longer king , and soundcard-driven software has taken over the market . Even receivers have changed the desktops of old ( quite apart from the current batch of ham transceivers that have general coverage radios built in ) have been pretty much supplanted by Software Defined Radios . Along with that , the digital modes themselves have changed drastically with some disappearing altogether , with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too , the original DigiFAQ combined many ham-related modes along with everything else . <p> Our original work did n't  really address some of the basic questions newcomers to this side of the hobby might have , so with Mike Chace-Ortizs help , I have been involved in rewriting and updating the FAQ . Its approach is different we start from topics like discussing radios , SDRs , some of the terminology you will see on mailing lists like the UDXF and much more . Only after we cover all of this do we discuss decoders and even here , this topic is broken down even further , to include those decoders that play nice with some SDRs , and some of the tools you can use to help analyze an unknown signal . <p> Then we go into the modes ( most are HF related , but we do touch on one or two common LW modes ) . We identify those modes that are dead , and separate them from the rarely used/active ones . Where possible we also supply waterfalls for each . <p> We also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for additional reading . <p> Perhaps of greatest use to newcomers is a listing of known scheduled broadcasts , so they can test what they download without wandering all over the place , hoping to find a readable signal and potentially getting turned off when the do n't  find one . We have also recovered a few articles from the old WUN archives as well as from SPEEDX ( Society to Preserve the Engrossing Enjoyment of DXing folded a long time ago ) on certain digital related topics , such as discussing how to read an AMVER transmission . <p> It should be noted that we also sent the amateur radio digital modes to their own page for a very simple reason while these modes are well understood ( and many have their own devoted page that cover their mode far better than we can ) , the single biggest reason was that these modes can NEVER be encrypted ( at least in the US , and likely other countries as well ) . Sad to say , but there are many modes outside of the amateur bands that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose is unclear . As of this writing , many UDXF members are noting signals thought to be Russian in origin , utilizing a variation of MFSK-16 , a mode generally associated with amateur radio . <p> Is this document complete ?

There are new modes being identified , new networks , and even new players being found all the time . There 's still more work to be done on this , and this is yet another change to the original DigiFAQ- its hosted on the RadioReference wiki , where any member ( with a free I 'd ) can edit and add to it . <p> I receive a lot of questions regarding digital modes even though- its an area of the hobby where I 'm quite weak .

@@75207434 @3907434/ <h> All India Radio investing heavily in DRM tranmitters <h> AIR has acquired 37 DRM transmitters , in talks to get cheaper radio sets <p> NEW DELHI : All India Radio ( AIR ) has introduced digital radio technology in the AIR Network by installing new state of the art Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM ) Technology transmitters by replacing old outlived 37 Medium Wave/ Short Wave transmitters . <p> Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore told Parliament however that the provisions contained in Policy Guidelines on expansion of FM Radio broadcasting services through private agencies ( Phase-III ) do not provide for private FM broadcasters to adopt digital radio technology . <p> He said Digital Radio allows significant improvements in service reliability , audio quality , more radio services and higher efficiency . <p> The new AIR transmitters include 35 new state of art technology Medium Wave ( MW ) / DRM transmitters as a replacement of old technology valve based MW transmitters . Additionally , two new state of the art technology Short Wave ( SW ) DRM transmitters have been approved for installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " All India Radio investing heavily in DRM tranmitters " <p> In principle DRM is an interesting technology for vast developing countries . Additionally I see India as the last chance for DRM . <p> But many mistakes have been made , also in India . For example it is absolutely no pleasure listening to the overseas service of AIR : Their signals sound as if they feed the the transmitters through a 1.000 km analog phone line . Sometimes the signal has lots of noise in the background . Another error is to transmit a second program which forces them to use a quite high data rate which leads to many interruptions of reception . <p> You might also remember my review of the Avion DRM receiver that I got privately from India : When you open the set you see that the developers put mich effort into shielding . They tried a lot to fill all possible holes where the RFI could escape , but did not find all of them . With the internal antenna and the original power supply I could receive next to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for HF but it has been badly implemented by broadcasters . This is not the reason it has n't  taken off but due to a lack of recievers/broadcasts , however narrow bandwidth with junk audio is putting the nail in the coffin of DRM . I firmly believe digital has to offer something to listener they cant get on analogue , otherwise its pointless . <p> I also hope they can improve the audio , because I have trouble hearing AIR here in the US , and even when the signal is good the audio can sometimes be poor . I 've gotten some data from AIRs DRM SW broadcasts before , but only text , no audio . I 'm using the Dream program on a PC with an SDRplay . <p> Here in Germany AIR produces quite good RF signals . But if a DRM signal drops out of sync the receiver needs quite a few seconds to provide any audio again . I therefore prefer AM signals with some fading . Especially if the station provides much better audio on its analog transmissions . <p> AIR DRM is received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licence option ) and 85% of the the audio is good here on occasion there is background 50Hz hum but of course that 's a broadcasting quality and professionalism of studio &amp; technical staff issue rather than a reflection on the actual technical attributes of DRM . Yes careful selection of bitrate and number of channels in the RF stream is being tested . The multi-stream service I usually receive here is from Bengaluru and the text I 'd says it is a test transmission , so I expect they are experimenting with different digital parameters . <p> Do n't  overlook the AIR investment in DRM is for MW and SW domestic services primarily . Their main audience for this DRM investment is the domestic audience . If they are successful in seeding low cost DRM MW receivers in the local retail outlets it most likely reach mass appeal via local electronics brands like Videocon , BPL , Onida , T-Series etc . The India market is plenty large enough to support introduction of DRM regardless of adoption of DRM by international shortwave broadcasters . India media is moving very quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radio listeners are using smart phones as the reception device rather than a traditional radio receiver . The market and demand is massive ! <p> Time will tell how all this pans out . If DRM fails in India I think it it would be most likely due to increased take up of IP broadcasting ( via 4G etc ) rather than any alternative RF broadcasting modality . <p> Mark : I agree that India intends to use DRM primarily for national services and that India is a large enough market for DRM receivers . Above I declared India as the last chance for DRM . If this market creates something cheaper and especially significantly better than the Avion set , we all could gain from it . <p> The Android receiver system that was mentioned here at SWLing repeatedly could be a good answer . But a rule of thumb in the software business is , that a project has failed if it has not been finished within three years . As long as they are developing they had to adapt to at least three major Android releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to Europe : The AF frequeny spectrum display shows a sharp cutoff at 3 kHz on both channels . Radio Romania shows that DRM can sound much better . RCI often provides 10 kHz audio bandwidth or even more in AM . That is something you can only hear with an SDR : Near VHF quality . <p> No doubt they have moved onto DRM transmitters , yet there is almost no improvement in the signal strength at many places even in India . Not just that , people do n't  listen to AIR in india anymore with private channels offering more strengthened signal and productive programmes . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207438 @3907438/ <h> A review of the CountyComm GP5/SSB portable radio : a great preparedness radio <p> On Tuesday I received the new CountyComm GP5/SSB portable shortwave radio , a sample sent me from CountyComm . If you 're familiar with the current shortwave portable landscape , then you 'll quickly note that the GP5/SSB shares a striking resemblance to both the GP5/DSP and the Tecsun PL-360. - While I- had n't  anticipated writing- yet another radio article- before the end of the year , - having just published a lengthy review of the CC Skywave , - my curiosity got the best of meand before I knew it , I 'd spent a few hours listening to and making notes about- the CountyComm GP5/SSB as I- put it- through its- paces . In the end , I found I had the makings of a review . <p> Who is CountyComm ? <p> Unlike most other brands I review , CountyComm has only one or two shortwave radio offerings . I wanted to know a little of the back story and motivation behind- creating the GP5/SSB , so I contacted CountyComm directly and- spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CountyComm is a retail distributor of products created primarily for- US government use . In a sense , CountyComm is the- consumer spill-over from the thousands of products- intended , - for example , for state and federal agencies . <p> According to CountyComm , the GP5/SSB is a case in point . The company received- a large order from a US government department for an " inexpensive , small portable , AM/FM/SW radio with SSB " for emergency supply caches and diplomatic posts . The GP5/DSP ( a.k.a. , Tecsun PL-360 ) fit the bill , but lacked SSB . The request was large enough that CountyComm approached SiLabsmanufacturer of the DSP chip in many of the portables on the marketand asked for help . SiLabs made some design changes and worked directly with the factory in China to produce the GP5/SSB . <p> Besides SSB , another interesting design CountyComm implemented was extending the upper- frequency range of the GP5/SSB to 29,999 kHz ; previous and similar Tecsun models only had an upper limit of 21,950 kHz . <p> You may note that as of today , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first batch of units were designed for ( and all purchased by ) CountyComm . However , I have already heard rumblings- that there will soon be a Tecsun PL-365 on the marketif so , no doubt it will turn out to be the- GP5/SSB . <h> First impressions <p> Appearance-wise , the GP5/SSB is nearly identical to its predecessor , the GP5/DSP or Tecsun PL-360 . The vertical form factor is rather unique in the ultra-portable world , this radio is designed for one-handed operation , much like a handy-talky. - The volume and tuning controls are on the right side of the radio and are designed to be operated by thumb ( for right-handed operators , at any rate ) . All of the buttons on the front face are easily operated by your thumbtheyre small , but have a firm response . The GP5/DSP ( like its predecessor ) lacks a back stand , but does have a belt clip . <p> The small internal speaker produces clear audio , but sounds a little tinny ; there is not even a hint of bass . Via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides a slight modification to the keypad layout to accommodate the new addition of SSB and a bright green antenna tip , the radio is identical to the GP5/DSP and Tecsun PL-360 . <h> FM Performance <p> The CountyComm GP5/SSB , like many other SiLabs-based receivers we review , has excellent FM sensitivity . <h> Medium Wave ( AM broadcast band ) Performance <p> The MW bar antenna increases performanceif using headphones , you will need a right angle connector to allow the MW antenna to rotate 360 degrees <p> While I have not yet had the opportunity to do a proper comp recording session with the CountyComm GP5/SSB versus comparable radios , I plan to do so in the near futurestay tuned for that , right here ! - I 'll create a post to give you a heads-up when I 've added medium wave samples to this review . <p> With that said , I expect- the GP5/SSB performance on medium wave will be very similar to that of the GP5/DSP and Tecsun PL-360 . I like the included rotatable ferrite bar antenna that plugs into an external antenna port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both overall sensitivity as well as nullifying unwanted signals . <h> Shortwave performance <p> I 've had a couple of opportunities- to compare the GP5/SSB with other portables on the shortwave bands ; - embedded audio samples follow of a strong station , a weaker station , and even an SSB sample . Note that all of the sample recordings were taken during poor band conditionsQSB ( fading ) is pronounced . <h> Single-sideband <p> Of course , when I received the GP5/SSB , the first thing I did was tune the ham radio bands in SSB mode . <p> Nick , the CountyComm rep in charge of the GP5/SSB design , is an amateur radio operator , and I 'm pleased that he represented the importance of- a truly functional SSB mode on this radio . <p> The GP5/DSP only has 1 kHz tuning steps : - more than adequate for broadcast listening , but too coarse for SSB . Amateur radio operators do not necessarily transmit right on a frequency ; they 're often slightly off-frequency , either accidentally or intentionally . And older ham radios- are also prone to drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSB need finer-tuning controls to hone in on SSB signals . But the- GP5/SSB has a work-around for this . <p> The GP5/SSB accommodates SSB by allowing the listener to select either the upper or lower sideband , then use the BFO function to help fine tune and zero-beat a signal . <p> Specifically , here 's how to- tune to- an SSB ( phone ) amateur radio signal with the GP5/SSB : <p> Turn on either the upper or lower sideband , depending on the meter band ( generally , 40 meters and below are lower ; - all- else , upper ) . <p> When you hear a signal , use the 1 kHz tuning increments to find where its strongest . <p> Now , press the BFO button once to activate BFO tuning ; the U or L ( indicating upper or lower ) will begin to blink . <p> While the sideband indicator is blinking , use the tuning wheel to adjust the BFO . Adjust tuning until the voices in the signal sound natural . <p> Once you 've done this a couple of times , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pleased with the SSB functionality and performance . While I prefer either very fine tuning increments , or a separate BFO knob ( no room for that on this tiny radio ) , I appreciate- that- CountyComm has used the BFO function to eliminate the need for a separate tuning wheel . <h> Audio samples <p> While there are a number of portable radios with SSB on the market , there are very few in this $80 price range with SSB . Indeed , to my knowledge there are no other SSB-capable portables currently on the market that are as compact as the CountyComm GP5/SSB . <p> Below , you can hear two representative audio samples of how each radio receives an SSB conversation between two ham radio operators on the 20 meter band . I like this sample because one of the operators has a very strong signal , while the other is much weaker : <p> You may notice that the GP5/SSB has a slightly higher noise floor and DSP artifacts while listening to the weaker signal . The PL-600 sounds a little muffled in comparison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20 and 40 meter ham radio bands . - At length I concluded that I prefer the PL-600 for weak-signal listening . The PL-600s AGC could cope with the QSB better than the GP5/SSB . <p> With the majority of- the SSB signals , however , I found that the GP5/SSBs audio was clearer and voices seemed to " pop " out better than on the PL-600 . <p> I should note that I also attempted to include the Grundig G6 in this comparison , but the G6 somehow picked up noise from my digital recorder , thus making the recorded audio sound worse than it actually was . To my ear , the Grundig G6s SSB reception was very similar to that of the CountyComm GP5/SSBthe G6 perhaps has a very- slight edge in terms of weak-signal reception . <p> As you probably hear in these examples , the GP5/SSB has fine- sensitivity , though not quite as good as- the PL-310ET . <p> I 've also noted good selectivity during- casual broadcast listening with the GP5/SSB . <p> However , I do not like the GP5/SSBs AGC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other portables in this comparisonits a little too reactive to fading on the broadcast bands . To be fair , these audio samples really accentuated the AGC on the GP5/SSB since all were made during poor reception conditions and pronounced fading . <p> Under normal conditions , I believe I would be quite pleased with the GP5/SSB ; - its otherwise on par with most of the other ultra-portables on the market . <h> Summary <p> Every radio has pros and cons , and I jot down my reactions as I evaluate a new radio so as not to forget any details . The following is my list : <h> Who should- purchase the GP5/SSB ? <p> If you 're looking for an ultra-portable radio for travel and general broadcast listening , I would encourage you to consider- the new C. Crane CC Skywave , the Tecsun PL-310ET or the Tecsun PL-380. - Overall , the performance and form factor of these radios are a better fit for broadcast listening . If you 're looking for armchair SSB listening , a larger portable with a larger internal speaker- such as the- Tecsun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GP5/SSB . <p> If you 're looking for an ultra-portable radio with SSB , then the GP5/SSB is a very good choice ( if not the only ultra-portable SSB choice currently on the market ) . While the SSB performance ca n't compare with larger , pricier receivers and ham radio transceivers , its very good for $80 US . <p> If you 're looking for an emergency communications receiversomething to stash in your vehicle , emergency kit or bug-out bagthe CountyComm GP5/SSB is a great choice and value . Indeed , that 's who the GP5/SSB was designed for ; that 's why this rig has excellent frequency coverage in all modes , with good sensitivity/selectivity and designed for portable , one-hand operation . In fact , CountyComm has even designed and- manufactured ( in the USA ! ) - a robust , protective 1000-Denier- case for the GP5/SSB . This case makes it very easy to strap the GP5/SSB to your belt or backpack securely . <p> In conclusion , the CountyComm GP5/SSB was designed for a specific purpose : to be an emergency communications receiver . It does this job quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortwave portables , and for this purpose , I can recommend it . <p> Excellent review . I have both the Pl-360 and the Countycomm GP-5/SSB . It seems to me that the GP-5/SSB has not only somewhat better audio , but it is also the more sensitive of the 2 receivers . <p> I decided to see what was under the hood , so I disassembled them to have a look . As expected , the Tecsun PL-360 is using the Si 4734 chip . The GP-5/SSB is using the same chip that is in the Tecsun PL-880 , which is the Si 4735 . <p> For those interested , I posted photos of the chips in the Pl-360 and the GP-5/SSB in the photos section of the Ultralight DX Yahoo group . The photo of the Tecsun PL-880 Si chip is in the photos section of the Tecsun PL-880 Yahoo group . <p> Bob , while I 'm sure its possible , I think it could be quite difficult . The base of the existing fixed whip is mounted pretty deep into the body of the radiothis gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to figure out a way to make a sturdy connection on the existing antenna port . <p> Ive been opening a radio and taking photos , doing experiments I 'll summarise the improvements , leaving out details . Try these things , you 'll probably like them . <p> First , if you want good FM sensitivity , wide stereo , low noise , you may already have tried the external input with a good dipole , and wondered why its not as good as doing the same thing with a PL-390 ( which is close to hi-fi quality on headphones when you do this ) . So find the small screw above the battery cover , remove it , pull out the internal whip . Remove it entirely . ( This is totally reversible with no harm , so have at it ) . You should see as much as 25 dB improvement on the signal strength and get a sound quality that easily rivals the PL-390 . The cause when the whip is stowed seems to be a cancellation due to residual VHF pickup interfering with the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirky internal wiring . By removing the whip entirely , you remove the problem entirely . This explanation may possibly not be correct , but removing the internal whip certainly works to get full performance from the external antenna . <p> The other improvement involved winding a BN-61-202 ferrite two-hole core for 560 -H using 36 turns , ideally with 3 strands of enamelled wire each 0.25mm thick , in parallel . This gets you a decent Q for good selectivity . Add a coupling coil of 4 turns . The main coil goes to the RF input , a mono 3.5 mm plug The other goes to a 3.5 mm socket . You 'll need a small plastic box to make a neat job of all this . The result ( minus one turn on the main winding if you 're in the US and want the top of MW , which is 1710 , higher than the EU 1620 my 36 turns is specified for ) will make excellent DX potential for MW based on a random wire input to the coupling coil , given a 6 foot ground rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a type 43 ferrite bead or two will make a clean feed from the far end of a long garden . This coil will allow tuning down to around 270 KHz , so even if it wont help with broadcast LW DX , it will help a lot for those of you who like NDB hunting , and using the SSB modes on these radios really helps with that , so this trick extends the capability of the radio a lot and also makes best use of what it has already . <p> Best of all , neither of these improvements need any internal access to the radio . They can be applied immediate and with ease to any of these radios at any time and will do them no harm . <p> To the RF input . = It does work I 've tried it with PL-360 and PL-365 . The antenna wiring internally is the same , and the external input is used for SW and VHF FM . <p> With the telescopic removed , the sensitivity of that input goes up dramatically . I specifically did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to allow a clean wide stereo image . The IC makes that image narrow on weak signals , to try to compromise for low noise with at least some stereo separation , but I did not like the compromise , so I started exploring Just using the external input helps , but not as much as also removing the whip at the same time ! <p> Bertrand , are you using a dipole or a random wire ? If a wire , you may find the input weak because the radios own ground plane is so small . A standard half-wave 75 ohm FM dipole works wonders if you raise it above the ground outside a house . The downward pointing 1/4 wave length of it will be your ground , you do n't  have to have an actual earth connection . Its easier to make a dipole out of coathangers and a bit of wood than it is to make an actual earth ground too , which is useful . <p> butit is still not clear ( ! ! ! ! ) where to connect the wire when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The external antenna socket does not work for FM ! ! ! ! ! ( was affirmed .. true or not ? ) . <p> I can only speak for myself , because there IS so much confusion . The internet is the murkiest invention of all time . I long ago decided to only post something if I 'd tested it myself ( Which of course means NO Wikipedia for me as they despise the one thing that would improve their site the most : original research ! = But never mind . <p> The RF input on the PL-360 or PL-365 is the central one on the top end of the case . It takes SW and VHF input . If anyone says otherwise , they need to re-read the manual , and test the radio . You already know about counterpoises , so you already know why those who claim that VHF wont work on that input are wrong . The odds are they did n't  provide any RF ground . <p> Actaually the manual does n't  help , it does not describe any use of that socket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being entirely sure why it works , but it does . I think the closeness of the tracks for the tip of the RF input connector and the VHF line from the internal whip may be coupling the VHF signal almost as well as the SMT capacitor on the VHF line itself . There are a few other components that may add to that coupling effect . If the RF is coming in from an external line , the stowed whip may be forced into behaving more like a counterpoise in comparison ! By removing this whip so more of the incoming signal is coupled where we want it , AND by providing a proper external counterpoise , will get the best possible result . This is what I found to be true , whether I have understood it correctly or not . = <p> I 'm assuming that the 360 and 365 should behave similarly with respect to the external antenna . There was a comment on Amazon someone left about the 360 which states : <p> The supplied external antenna , taken outdoors , really helped boost marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio showed no signs of overloading and almost no broadcast band breakthrough just one spot on 3rd harmonic of nearby 50kW AM station was heard , and it was not very strong . Cheap radios often come to pieces when you put any sort of real antenna on them , so this is another pleasant surprise . Again , it wo n't win any awards for dynamic range , but its better than many inexpensive radios Ive tried . <p> As an aside , the AM antenna jack appears to go to the same input as the SW whip does , so you CAN attach an external SWL antenna with a mono jack into the AM in . However , according to the drawing in my manual there is a low-pass filter between the whip and the IC input that you will be bypass by jacking into the AM socket , so overload may be more likely . Then again , it might be fine depending on the particulars , so I 'd say experimenting is worthwhile . <p> UPDATE : Connecting both ends of a 25 foot wire to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurious signals going all the way into the 7 Mhz region . So , a big antenna should not go on this radio through the AM jack . Its still OK for 25 feet of wire to the tip connector though . <p> I agree , I 've heard some MW signals blast their way through the low end of SW too , using a 12m vertical whip at the end of the garden . I ended up building a small ESD protection box with a 1K pot as attenuator which cleans up low end SW signals . The long whip outside is mainly to get a decent SNR . Its easy to attenuate , less easy to get a good signal in an inner city to start with <p> The modification I describe , removal of the internal whip , is aimed at getting a good stereo VHF signal , and is reversible without opening the radio . <p> The person who posted that Amazon comment describes a loop . This radios AM tuned circuit needs an inductor which is either the internal ferrite rod , or the external one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip to sleeve on the RF input , the inductance may have ended up within range for MW tuning and worked with the ICs internal capacitance to produce a strong interference from MW signals into SW that may be a lot less bothersome with a whip or random wire . An attenuator box with ESD protection is worth building because it can protect any RF input when using a long vertical antenna , many cheap radios do n't  have this ability . <p> Nice , if it works with the whip , alls good . If you 're listening on headphones you may find the stereo image narrowing as the IC tries to reduce noise in the case of anything but the strongest signals . I like the SSB version of the PL-360 , better even than PL-880 . With a bit of experiment , I think there are more advantages than shortcomings , unless we really need a big room-filling sound . <p> I received this radio just before Christmas 2015 . Bear in mind this is my first SW radio so I 'm still learning . I 've always wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've found it . The fact that this radio has continuous coverage from 1711 to 29,999 KHZ makes this superior to many of the world radios out there that have gaps in their coverage . The sleep and alarm features make it perfect for travel . There is no " buzzer " on the alarm and instead turns on the radio so be sure to set to a reliable frequency that will be broadcasting when you need to wake and an appropriate volume that will wake you . <p> So far Ive listened to stations in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia ; Ankara , Turkey , Bucharest Romania , Havana , Cuba including the so called " Cuban Numbers " stations , Australia and of course numerous stations in the U.S. including the " clocks " in Fort Collins Colorado . Given that I live in the south central U.S. all I can say is wow , simply wow ! <p> I do hear what others are saying about the FM sensitivity . On stations with strong signals playing music the output is distorted , particularly at low volume . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference in FM performance . I 've found not extending the whip is just as effective as is using the included earbuds and turning up the volume a bit . With my Bose headphones the distortion can be fairly pronounced as it does n't  take nearly as much power to drive these headphones . Overall , this distortion only occurs when the broadcast is music . For talk stations ( e.g. NPR ) this is n't an issue . This radio was clearly designed for listening to " talk radio " . <p> County Comm is currently including a Maratac case for free with purchase of the radio . This case is really heavy duty . I removed the heavy metal belt clip and found a way to get the radio , external antennas and earbuds all secured inside the case . This makes for a nice 11 oz. kit including 3 AA rechargeable batteries . Again , perfect for travel . <p> You say " I 've tried removing the external whip antenna and did n't notice a difference in FM performance . " , but in what context ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground or counterpoise . A standard dipole raised above ten foot or so is enough to work extremely well . This is true for Tecsun PL-360 and PL-365 ( I have tested both ) , and I doubt the CountyComm radio is wired differently inside . <p> One possible reason for difference is that here in England there are a few BBC stations with hi-fi transmissions on VHF FM , and maybe the US uses that band differently . Even so the difference of over 20dB should be easily had , even if the broadcast format does n't  make much obvious difference in stereo image quality . How much effect all this has if trying to DX long distance signals I do n't  know , because the aim ( and the good result ) was specifically aimed at getting the best out of strong local hi-fi standard broadcasting . <p> Ok so I bought mine a month ago and love it , but I have one real quick question , when i 'm in the car the reception goes to zero , can anyone give me some advice to go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the vehicle or something , Anyway please help anyone , Chris K5RCW <p> You will definitely need an external antenna for a metal vehicle . The vehicle chassis and body will make an excellent counterpoise too . So then the question is " how do you get the signal into the radio while eliminating most the RF noise in the vehicle ? <p> The single best way I know to solve this demands some serious DIY . A few posts up , I made an earlier post : TWO WAYS TO IMPROVE PL-360 , PL-365 , GP-5/SSB. Look at the second way . It is even possible to build that small inducttor to replace the tiny internal ferrite rod , but that then becomes a permanent modification to the radio . Either way , you must keep the wires as short as possible , because reducing stray capacitance maintains the full tuning range , important if you want to tune MW as well as get some of LW too . <p> The neat thing about this DIY inductor is that one vertical whip should give you a decent performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of performance will depend largely on how long a whip you can get away with on your vehicle , and on how well you couple to its body for your counterpoise . <p> I am MUCH more interested in its use of the Silicon Labs Chip and would like to see a Premium Larger Receiver in the $ 200 range using this Chip but having better Clarity and EFFECTIVE SYNC like the PL 660 but the Hardware Package of the PL 880 . <p> This little unit shows another implementation of the Silicon Labs IC- and the possibilities for a TECSUN PL 900 going a step beyond the PL 880 in Clarity AND two steps beyond PL 880 in SYNC DETECTOR . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207444 @3907444/ <p> Hi there , subscribers to the Oxford Shortwave Log YouTube channel- and regular readers of this excellent website will be aware that- I have been using a Bonito Boni whip E-field wideband antenna for a couple of months now . You may have seen my previous post here , detailing some excellent initial DX results achieved with the Boni Whip . What makes this antenna so compelling for a DXer such as myself is simply that its so light and compact ; I can literally take it anywhere . Currently it lives in a small flight case ( see above &amp; below ) on the back seat of my car , with either my Sony ICF-SW55 or Eton Satellit , a home-brew battery pack ( that literally cost pence ) and some peripheral bits and pieces ; spare batteries , cables etc .

Of course , there are H-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will effectively reject QRM , if that 's an issue for the user , but at a significant cost delta . <p> - <p> Since my last posting , I have continued to use the Boni Whip regularly on my DXpeditions and upload the reception videos to my YouTube channel . I have been nothing but totally impressed with this antenna , to the point that I 've actually been surprised by- the signals Ive caught and recorded with it . Recent catches include a number of low-power stations from Brazil , including Radio Bandeirantes Sao Paolo , Radio Voz Missionaria Camboriu ( on the 49 and 31 metre broadcast bands ) and Radio Aparecida . Some of these signals are incredibly difficult to hear in Europe at all , let alone well and yet the ultra-compact Boni-Whip running off AA batteries , coupled to the ( equally brilliant ) Eton Satellit managed it with aplomb .

The cost of all of the DoD civilians overseeing the procurement for years is also added in . Also the cost of setting up the supply chain and for depot storage . <p> Just as a side note , all of the things the military does to set milspect performance to insure a good product is actually procured and fielded was set up to protect the military for getting crap for equipment .

@@75207454 @3907454/ <h> A preliminary review of the PK Loop C-LOOP-HDSW6-18 <p> Over the past year , a number of SWLing Post readers have asked me to review the PK Loop portable magnetic loop antenna produced by- Paul Karlstrand in Australia . <p> I finally caved in and purchased one . <p> I ordered the shortwave version of the loop , the- C-LOOP-HDSW6-18 in early November and received it about one week later . <p> The Sony SW100 tuned to WBCQ . <p> I was first introduced to this antenna by SWLing Post contributor , Mark Fahey , who brought it to the SWL Fest and our 2015- PARI DXpedition . <p> Mark has taken his PK Loops ( both the shortwave and mediumwave models ) on his numerous travels around the world . He finds that they 're relatively effective portable antennas in RFI-dense environments like hotels and guest houses . They 're better at mitigating RFI than , say , portable wire antennas or telescopic whips . <p> Mark hooks up his portable SDR to the PK Loop and makes spectrum recordings- ( wideband recordings ) from , say , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen and tune at his leisure via his laptop or tablet PC. - While I 've certainly made spectrum recordings while travelling in the past , the appeal of such a portable loop antenna is what finally caused me to pull the trigger . <h> Overview <p> The PK Loop is a small loop antennameasuring about 12 ? in diameter . Its encased in UV-stabilized PVC conduit and the matching box also seems to be made of PVC . It feels very durable and can , no doubt , even survive the wildest of luggage handling . <p> The PK Loop has an attached battery 9V battery holder , but can actually be powered by any- 9-18 volt DC supply . Current consumption is less than 15 mA . On the matching box , you 'll find a tuning knob , a BNC connector , DC power in port and a HI/LOW gain switch . My loop shipped with a- 2 meter BNC-BNC Cable , 3.5mm adapter , - and DC Power lead to open ends . <h> Operation <p> Operating the loop is very simple : <p> Power the antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the high or low gain setting <p> Place it on a stable surface ( height from the ground is not a critical- issue , but you should avoid placing it next to noisy electronics or mobile phones ) <p> Connect the PK Loop to your receivers antenna jack with the supplied cable <p> Turn on your receiver to the desired meter band , then adjust the loops tuning knob until you hear the signal level peak <p> Start listening , keeping in mind that as you tune around the band you may need to adjust the loops tuning knob for maximum gain <p> Loop antennas , in general , are fairly narrow-band andunlike a Wellbrook or Pixel Loopmanual adjustments need to be made with the tuning knob to match the PK Loop as you scan across bands . <p> Still , I see why Mark favors the PK Loop for spectrum recordings : the bandwidth is wide enough that if I tune the loop to the middle of the 31 meter band , for example , it does a fine job covering the entire band . <h> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving the PK Loop earlier this month , but over Thanksgiving holiday , I took it to my familys home that has relatively high RFI levels . <p> The following are a couple of videos I made with my Moto X smartphone . Ill be the first to admit that these are not the best videosI had no tripod and the Motos microphone leaves much to be desiredbut I think you 'll still get the idea of how well the PK Loop works . <h> With the Sony SW100 <h> With the Elecraft KX2 <p> So far , I 'm very pleased with the PK Loop . It does seem to mitigate noise better than other portable antennas Ive used in the past and certainly improves my SW100s reception . It makes SWLing with the Elecraft KX2 or KX3 easy and convenient . <p> One word of caution : if you use the PK Loop with a transceiver like the KX2 , please turn off the ATU , and set the power level to 0W before using . The PK Loop is receive-only and will not handle any RF power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PK Loops low gain setting . I 'm a little nervous about overloading the SW100 , so do not plan to use the high gain setting . The Elecraft KX2 seems happy to handle either gain setting : I imagine this will be the case with most general coverage transceivers and tabletop receivers . <h> More to come ! <p> In a couple of weeks , I 'll be staying in a hotel room ( likely with inoperable windows and heavy RFI ) so I will attempt to put the loop through its paces and compare it with my radios built-in antenna . - Stay tuned ! <p> Post readers : have you used the PK Loop or other similar portable/travel antennas ? Please comment ! <h> 10 thoughts on " A preliminary review of the PK Loop C-LOOP-HDSW6-18 " <p> I looked at this loop several weeks ( maybe two months ? ) ago , and I exchanged emails with the builder .

@@75207460 @3907460/ <h> New Beta version of SdrDx allows for AFEDRI AFE822 two input phasing <p> Many thanks to SWLing Post contributor , David Goren , who shares this tip from Chris Smolinski at Black Cat Systems : <p> If you have an AFE822 Dual Channel SDR , and a Mac , run , do not walk , to the SdrDx website , and download a copy of the beta version . It now let 's you phase the two inputs , much like using an external phaser such as the MFJ-1026 . Great for nulling out another station , or noise/QRM . I have some descriptions of how to do this , along with some recordings , and the relevant links , in this HFU post . I believe a Windows version will be out shortly . <p> A few months ago , I picked up an AFE822 dual channel SDR , one of the reasons was to experiment with using it as a phaser for MW DXing . It was a bit of a daunting task , having to essentially write an entire SDR app . I then realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat between the SDR and the SDR app , which would take the pair of I/Q channels from the SDR , and adjust their relative amplitude and phase , and combine them into a single I/Q channel , and send that on to the SDR app . I played around a bit with that , and was quite impressed with the results . I passed on the general idea to the author of SdrDx , who has implemented it in a beta of the app , which is nice because now it is all self contained , rather than having to use my kludgy app in the middle Grin <p> There 's gain adjustments for each RF input , as well as a phase control , an invert switch to flip the phase 180 degrees , and switches to zero either of the RF inputs , useful when first roughly setting up the gains . <p> I am quite impressed with how well it is working . As an example , here is a recording of 1680 AM from earlier this morning . I toggled the invert on the phase control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two dominant stations on that frequency . <p> This is going to be really nice for MW DXing . SdrDx is for both Windows and the Mac . If you 've been considering getting an SDR , this feature alone in SdrDx is reason enough to get an AFEDRI AFE822 . If you do buy one , be sure to let Alex of AFEDRI know the reason is because of SdrDx , we need to support the authors of third party SDR apps we use , and let the hardware manufacturers know how important they are . <p> Familiarize yourself with SdrDx if you have not used it before . You need two antennas of course , one plugged into each of the AFE822 inputs . <p> To use phasing : <p> Click on the PHA button , turn on Dial Channel Phasing Mode . Click OK to close the window . <p> Click the Run button to get the SDR into Run mode . Tune in whatever MW frequency you want to use . Ideally one with two stations you can hear at the same time . Graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SDR center frequency offset from that . For example if you want to null 1300 AM , make the center frequency 1305 or something like that . Or the I/Q imbalance will cause problems . <p> Click the PHA button to open the phasing window again . You want to keep it open now . <p> Make sure the Invert checkbox is off , the Both Channels On radio button is on . Set the Phase slider to the middle , both Gains to zero , far left . <p> Adjust the first Gain slider to bring the signal level up to a reasonable level . S9 . S9+10 , whatever you want . Make a note of it . <p> Click Chan A Muted <p> Now adjust the second Gain slider to bring the signal level up to where it was before with the first RF input . The goal here is to make the signal levels about the same , so you can begin the process of nulling out one of the stations , with some chance of it working . <p> Click Both Channels On now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adjust the Phase control , until you notice a dip in the signal strength . Try to get it centered in the dip as close as possible . <p> Then adjust one of the gain sliders , I usually use the one with the largest value to make things easier , to increase the dip in the signal strength . <p> Then go back to the Phase control , and try to increase the dip . You may now notice the dominant station starting to be nulled , by listening to it . <p> Then , like washing your hair , lather , rinse , repeat . You have to iterate back and forth many many times . Eventually , if your two antennas produce different enough signals for the two stations , you will be able to null it out . There are cases where you can not null out one station , because the antennas produce the same signal for both of them . So nulling out one also nulls out the other . But this is rare . <p> You can click in the invert checkbox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of my recordings to hear this in action . You are changing the phase by 180 degrees when you do this . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

Initially we envisioned and designed what we call an ATU ( Antenna Tuner Unit ) that plugged into a standard Android tablet .

Which it is its built for a purpose , and part of that is to keep the cost low .

" <p> Adam Ellis in Melbourne , Australia : <p> The Yaesu FRG-7700 ( Photo : Universal Radio ) <p> " As a school kid , growing up in the 80s , I had a friend who 's father owned ( a then ) brand new Yaesu FRG-7700 with matching FRT-7700 tuner . Every time I visited at my friends house , I would look at the Yaesu in awe and ask to have a listen . <p> His father was a VERY strict man and forbid any of the children from touching his radio or HiFi equipment . The combination of parentally installed fear and the mystique of such a military looking and expensive piece of kit meant that my curiosity grew and grew . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered it up and had a tune around . After a few minutes , I was instantly hooked , having now heard SSB properly for the first time . My friend quickly got concerned that his younger siblings would tell their father that we had dared to use the Yaesu so it was quickly turned off . <p> Well ! My friend still got into trouble because we had left it tuned to an obscure frequency , along with several controls in the wrong position and his father realized it had been fiddled with ! The feel of the controls and the glow of the dial lighting made that radio seem like the best thing I had ever seen and just had to own one . Of course , as a 12 year old , owning one meant selling many hundreds of newspapers ! A feat all but impossible on my limited paper round . <p> Fast forward 30 years and I came across a used example at a Hamfest , complete with FRT-7700 tuner in near mint condition . I made an offer which was accepted ( AUD$150 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its original box ! Upon testing it out , it works flawlessly with no fading of the display or noise from any of the control pots . <p> My only real disappointment with the radio is the minimum 1Khz tuning steps . It makes SSB a bit painful to tune . You need to save a frequency into to memory to use the memory fine tune control . It sounds very nice on AM and is mostly used for broadcast reception with a Wellbrook ALA1530 loop . <p> Even today , looking at the Yaesu brings back the fear laden excitement of tuning around as a kid , with a petrified friend begging me to turn it off ! I never did find out what his punishment was . The Yaesu FRG-7700 is now a part of a large collection of receivers , but is one I will not part with because it has taken me so long to finally get one ! 73s , Adam .

@@75207476 @3907476/ <h> A review of the Como Audio Solo <p> But exactly why did I buy this small , self-contained digital music device ? Having just completed an in-depth review of several WiFi radios , I certainly did n't  need another . - But the good-looking Solo , with its clean design and- walnut casing- really caught my attentionI could n't resist checking it out . - Plus , in- backing the radio via Kickstarter , I was able to purchase it for $100 less than the predicted future retail of $299 US . <p> The Kickstarter campaign- funding Como Audio- was prompt in communicating updates with backers and providing even more product options during the wait for production and delivery . Although several other snazzy finishes for the Solo were brandished before me , I stuck firmly by the walnut veneer I 'd originally chosen . <p> Fast forward to- the present . I finally received my Como Audio Solo a few- weeks ago , and have had time- to play with it . While I have n't had time to explore every nuance of this radio , of course , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design <p> I do n't  often comment on the design of radios I review , but in this case its worth noting . <p> The Como Audio Solo , in wood , is elegant and simple. - Love it : <p> The- only element of the- design- I 'm not typically keen on ? - I 'm not the biggest fan of devices that sport colored backlit displays ; to me they appear- a bit flash and faddish , - undermining- a radios- overall aesthetic . <p> But I must say , the Solo pulls it off . - The color display in this case is somehow not too distractingits soft yet crisp , and easy to read even at a distance . <p> In short , the Solo is- a stunning- piece of kit , especially with that warm walnut casing , and looks right at home in any settingoffice , living area , kitchen , or at the bedside . <p> I 've only one gripe with the Solos ergonomics : the front control knobs are a little too close to the bottom of the recessed controls area . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FM bandI find my fingertips wo n't fit between the knob and lower edge of the recessed panel , making the knobs a little hard to turn in one fluid motion . ( Of course , this is also due to the fact that I have big fingers ; my wife does n't  seem to have this problem ) . <p> But- this is n't a dealbreaker as Im- finding I do n't  often need to reach for the- front controls , anyway . - Why ? Because the rigs IR remoteor better yet , its smartphone appcontrol the radio effectively at any convenient- distance from the radio . - Sweet . <h> Audio <p> I 'm a sucker for quality- audio fidelity , and I must admit that this was one of the biggest deciding factors in purchasing the Solo : it touted extraordinary audio in a modest package , being designed around an- acoustic chamber/chassis containing a 3 ? woofer and 3/4 ? dome tweeter fueled by a 2 X 30 watt RMS amplifier . I was very curious whether it could- live up to its initial claim . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately wanted to hear audio , so I put it in Bluetooth mode and played a few songs , ranging from Jazz to Electronica . <p> In a nutshell : - Wow . <p> The audio is strikingly reminiscent of my Tivoli Audio Model Onewhich is to say , its excellent . It packs more audio punch than any of the radios I reviewed in my WiFi radio comparison . <p> Out of the box , the audio is fairly well-balanced , too . But you can tweak the equalizer , and I did , drawing in- a little more bass and treble . - My wife ( also a bit of an audiophile ) was impressed . And yes , the sound is all the more remarkable considering the radios- relatively small form-factor : - little box , big voice . <h> FM Reception <p> The Como Audio Solo is one of the few Wifi radios on the market that has a built-in analog FM and DAB receiver ( save the $120 Sangean WFR-28 , - which has analog FM reviewed here ) . <p> Since I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I have , however , had an opportunity to test the FM analog reception . - Keep in mind , I live in a rural area and require a decent FM receiver with telescopic antenna fully extended just to listen to my favorite regional programming . <p> When I tune the Solo to my benchmark FM stations , it can receive thembut not as effectively as many of my other radios , including the WFR-28 . Even when forced to use the Mono setting only , the stations it receives carry- too much static for- good listening . - So obviously the Solo is n't as sensitive as some of my other radios , at least in this- setting . Indeed , few- stations it receives in this area are able to lock in to the- point that there 's no static in the received audio . For out-of-towners , this is a bit of a disappointment . <p> With this said , I imagine if you live in an urban area , the FM receiver should- more than please you . I 've no doubt it can- faithfully reproduce beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while FM reception is n't stellar for distant stations , the RDS information does convey even when the audio is n't full fidelity . <h> WiFi radio <p> Of course , the main reason I purchased the Como Audio Solo was to use and review it as a WiFi radionothing at all to do with that sharp walnut chassis , or audio power . <p> As I outlined in my WiFi Radio primer , WiFi radios rely on station aggregatorsextensive curated databases of radio stationsto- surf and serve up the tens of thousands of streaming stations around the globe . <p> Based on feedback from Como Audio shortly after the Kickstarter launch , I was under the impression that the station aggregator of choice was vTuner . This concerned me , as vTuners reputation as an aggregator is somewhat maligned due to a series of documented faults and weaknesses . - Fortunately , this turned out not to be the case : after the- initial confusion , I soon discovered Como- had adopted the more robust- Frontier Silicon aggregator , - insteada better choice . <p> Since I 'm a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using their service with my Sangean WFR-28 , once I connected my radio to my user account , the WiFi portion of the radio felt identical to that of my WFR-28 . Simply brilliant , as the Frontier Silicon radio portal gives the user flexibility to create station lists and folders with easeall of which readily convey to the radio itself . <p> The Solo- also features six dedicated memory buttons on the front panel for quick access to favorites . <h> Summary <p> And- am I please with the Solo so far ? <p> Ill reply with- a resounding " Yes ! " <p> I love the Solos designthis- certainly is a handsome product . Moreover , I love the audio , and am pleased that it delivers the fidelity promised by its Kickstarter campaign . The Solo and Duet are loaded with features , connections , Aux In and Aux Out audio and digital portsmore , in fact , than any similar device with which I 'm familiar . I regret that the rigs- FM is n't suited for country life , but the audio coupled with its stylish exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish the Solo had an internal rechargeable battery option . Being able to move the receiver to different locations within a home or building- could be a major plus for rural FM reception . As my friend John pointed out , however , the audio amplifier is robust enough , it might have been a challenge to implement an affordable-but-effective internal battery without compromising the audio amplifiers needs . <p> In truth , I favor audio fidelity over portability for a tabletop radio . <p> In conclusiondo I have any backers remorse ? - Absolutely not ! <p> In short , the Como Audio Solo is a keeper . - I 'm still marvelling at- this classy and- dynamic radio that fills our home with rich beautiful audio . A few weeks- in , the Solo has already become a permanent feature in our abode . Its one of the few radios I have that meets my artist wifes approval in terms of both design and audio . <p> Great job , Como Audio ! - If the Solo is any indication of radios- to come , I 'll certainly be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " A review of the Como Audio Solo " <p> I am a heavy user of internet radios and have a few scatted around the home , the one most frequently used is the Grace in the kitchen .

Regular viewers will also be aware that I enjoy experimenting with different antenna set-ups , particularly pushing the boundaries with longwires coupled to- portables .

Did you use a balun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead-in ( coaxial or just the antenna wire itself ) just connected to the centre of the receiver antenna jack ? And what was the gauge of the antenna wire and was it insulated ? <p> This was just a quick test , so simply a coaxial feed in . I tried a nooelec 9:1 balun which made no difference to either receiver . I am currently building my own baluns , suitable for 75 and 50 ohm input in weather-proof enclosures . These will allow an earth from the antenna side and an earth to the lead-in coaxial shielding . The wire is deployed from a spool manually about 5 feet above ground . The final version will be supported by canes every 10 metres or so . 73 . <p> Baluns have little to no effect for receivers . The signal loss due to impedance mismatching is easily compensated by the gain of the receiver . However a balun is useful for one thing : it protects the input circuitry of the radio against static electricity . <p> I used to use a 200m antenna a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also captured a lot of atmospheric noise ( I 'm located near mountains ) so on SW often the S/N ratio was n't too great . <p> I should have been more specific ; mine and the original purpose of the Beverage design I am using is mainly for LW /MW DX where baluns can have more of a positive effect with impedance matching . Having said that , no apsect of the design is critical , including the termination resistance . You are absolutely right that they protect from static discharge . 73 <p> Nothing short of astounding .

Note that its not uncommon for the Voice of Korea to unexpectedly go off air , likely due to power shortages : this fact is much more suggestive of the of general conditions in the country than the " news " itself . <p> Depending on where you live in the world , your ability to hear the ( relatively weak ) Voice of Korea will vary . - If you live in the Asia/Pacific region , the station is very audible . <h> 7 thoughts on " Propaganda from the source : Listening to the Voice of Korea on shortwave radio " <p> There have been some very odd transmissions from them recently form a technical standpoint . Today on 15180khz there were two languages going out at the same time . When I checked other transmissions it was also the same . <p> The 18:00 GMT transmission to Europe could hardly be heard here in Germany : On 13,760 kHz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kHz I could identify their interval sign below Radio Peking . <p> On 15,245 kHz I could understand " Korea " but not much more . Neither my NRD-525G nor playing with AM/USB/LSB/ATT made them really understandable . The signal was at least 20 dB weaker than most signal near by . The noise sounded like intermodulation but did not react to the attenuator . And my RX should not have these problems <p> If I use a Sangean ATS-909x in Midwestern America , can I hear the Voice of Korea ? Or is that too weak of a radio ? If so , can you please suggest one that can pick it up ? Thank you so much ! And thank you for the article . = 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207501 @3907501/ <h> Review of the Kaito KA108 <p> Recently , - I learned about a new portable by Kaito Electronics : the Kaito KA108 . While there are a number of compact portables on the market , the KA108 really caught my attention because it features- a built-in digital recorder . Which is to say , you can listen to a station on shortwave , press a button , and the KA108 will record it to a MicroSD card. - Pretty cool , right ? Its also the first shortwave portable Ive ever known that offers- a scheduling feature for recordings . <p> In the past there have been a few shortwave portables with digital recording capabilities , but most of these have been plagued with poor performance . So this time , - I had my fingers crossed that Kaito might have produced a winner . <p> Having used the KA108 for several days now , my initial review follows , - with a- focus on shortwave as well as mediumwave performance . <p> Users Manual <p> The KA108 actually ships with two manuals : a quick start reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual is written in English and is quite descriptive , despite a- number of spelling and grammar errors that should have been caught before going to print . Its obvious that Kaito didnt- hire a native English speaker/professional editor to check their copy . - ( I do n't  understand why a company would go to the expense to produce a manual without having it professionally editedKaito , please take note ! ) - Fortunately , these- spelling and grammar errors , while annoying , can be overlooked and/or deciphered by most English-speaking readers . <p> Tuning <p> On the plus side , the KA108 sports a full number keypad for direct frequency entry . This makes tuning to a known frequency a very simple process " " with one exception ( see below ) . There 's also a tuning wheel on the right side of the radio . <p> Note where the " 0 " is placed on the keypad : why the change ? <p> Using the keypad requires- some getting used to , however . Most of us " " myself included " " are familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game plan : as you can see above , the " 0 " button is located on the lower right side of the main keypad . So it took me a few hours of use before I could reliably key in a frequency without looking at the radio . <p> In my humble opinion , Kaito should have moved the number pad up one row , positioned- the " ATS " button to- the lowest row on the left , the " 0 " button to its- immediate right , - and completed the bottom row with the " Rewind/Play/Fast-Forward " buttons . <p> Another annoyance " " and this is a big one for me " -is that the KA108 has extended muting between frequency changes . It makes band-scanning a frustrating experience . I made a short video demonstrating this : <p> The audio fidelity is excellent- on FM , and when playing back a full-fidelity digital recording . Unfortunately , when tuned to the AM broadcast ( mediumwave ) band or to the shortwave bands , the KA108 falls short ; the bass response actually becomes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KA108 audio has issues. - A- further explanation of the KA108s audio- is described in the- performance notes- that follow . <p> FM Performance <p> On a positive note , the Kaito KA108 has respectable FM reception . I was able to receive all my benchmark FM stations with little trouble , and the KA108 maintained a strong lock on all signals . <p> And as mentioned above , KA108 audio via the built-in speaker is much better on FM than on any other band . Indeed , on FM , the KA108 produces rich , full-fidelity audio that can easily fill a room . Audio is similar to that of the Melson M7 and the Melson S8 . <h> Shortwave Performance <p> I 'm quite disappointed with the KA108s shortwave performance . <p> Almost immediately after unboxing the KA108 , I inserted a- battery , walked outdoors , and tuned through the 31 meter band . <p> Other than a couple of blow-torch North American private broadcasters , I heardnothing . It was during this first band scan that I realized how annoying the tuning mute could be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assumed that there was some local interference , and simply turned the radio off , hoping the following- day would produce a change for the better . <p> The following day , I spent a great deal of time with the KA108 on the air , and compared it with- the Eton Traveller III and the Tecsun PL-310ET " " both capable , similarly-priced compact DSP radios . <p> At first I thought it might be an issue with receiver sensitivity , but the KA108 could receive almost every station the Traveller III and the PL-310ET could receive . But the audio was so muffled on the KA108 , even with - the use of- headphones , that spoken word was hard to interpret . Additionally , the over-active AGC ( Automatic Gain Control ) meant that audio levels were all over the place . That combination makes for fatiguing listening . <p> Volume level indicator . <p> Over the next- few days with the- KA108 on shortwave , I drew a few conclusions . <p> After recognizing- that the audio fidelity did not improve significantly when using headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative impact on shortwave audio , as follows : <p> The default AM bandwidth is too narrow for broadcasts , and can not be adjusted <p> - Portions of the shortwave bands are polluted by internally-generated noise/interference <p> This combination makes for sloppy shortwave performance . <p> To save time in making the KA108s comparison information readily available , as well as to indicate- actual speaker performance , I decided to take a few quick comparison videos not with the KA108 or an external mic but simply with my- smartphone . While my phones microphone is somewhat limited , I believe you 'll be able to observe- the - inherent problems with the KA108 . <p> I compared the KA108 with the Traveller III in each video . <p> In the first comparison , I tuned to Radio Exterior De Espa+a on 9690 kHz , as you 'll see . The signal was marginal or relatively weak at the time : <h> Mediumwave Performance <p> Mediumwave ( a.k.a. , AM broadcast band ) performance is very similar to shortwave performance . <p> In this video , I 've tuned to an AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KA108 can receive the station , but audio is not pleasant and the AGC is , yet again , overactive . I 've noticed that the mediumwave band is plagued by more internally-generated noise than are the shortwave bands . <p> Note that YouTubes copyright checking system flagged my video because it recognized the song being played in the background on WTZQ . I believe this easily qualifies as fair use since the clips are short and its an off-air recording with dialog on top . I 've disputed this , but YouTube may choose to delete this video . - In anticipation , I 've saved the audio from this videoyou can listen to it by clicking here . <p> In a nutshell , AM performance on the Kaito KA108 is frankly poor . Even when I tuned to strong local stations , the audio sounded muffled and distorted , much as in the Radio Havana Cuba example above . <p> So- you can forget about using the KA108 for mediumwave DXing . <p> MP3/WAV Playback and recording <p> There are some redeeming virtues with the KA108 , however . - Heres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've played a wide variety of audio files on the KA108 , and am very impressed with its on-board MP3/WAV player . While audio characteristics unfortunately can not be adjusted " " i.e. , there 's no equalization " " I find the default audio settings well-balanced for both music and voice . <p> The KA108 has a dedicated MicroSD slot and a covered USB slot on top of the unit . <p> Recording directly from shortwave and mediumwave is also quite good . I believe its on-board recorder is perhaps the best I 've tried in recent portables ; its- a marked improvement over that of the Kaito KA29 , for example . It seems to capture the receivers produced audio well , with only a slight , high-pitched " hiss " injected in the audio , though this is not a major distraction . <p> Sadly the main distraction is that the recorder is recording audio , - as I 've outlined above , - from a sub-par receiver . <p> Invariably , all radios have strengths and weaknesses ; here 's a list of my notes from the moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Great portable size <p> Clear back-lit display <p> Numerous recording and playback features <p> Audio via MP3 or headphones is strong , considering the small speaker with acoustic chamber provides more bass response and volume than comparable portables ( see con ) <p> Excellent FM reception <p> Excellent MP3/WAV playback with well-balanced audio fidelity <p> Recorder schedule function <p> Alarms and sleep timers easy to use <p> Dedicated MicroSD and USB slots on top of chassis <p> Cons : <p> Mediocre sensitivity on SW and MW <p> Internally-generated noise on MW and SW <p> Audio ( via built-in speaker ) is : <p> too bass-heavy , lacks treble on MW/SW <p> garbled and mushy on MW/SW <p> " hot " and often splatters/distorts when signals are- strong <p> Tuning <p> extended mute between frequency changes <p> no " scan to next station " function ( only ATS ) <p> Odd numeric keypad layout <p> Any local RFI garbles reception even further on SW/MW <p> No SSB ( in fairness , few radios in this price class have SSB ) <p> Antenna swivel to the front somewhat blocked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the Kaito KA108 to be a strong " " or even average " " performer . Why ? Because , like many of you , I would love to have a capable shortwave/mediumwave radio with- built-in digital recording and playback . <p> Sadly , the KA108 falls short on multiple levels . <p> Concerned that I might have simply received a defective unit " " as I did when I reviewed- the Sangean ATS-405 " " I contacted Kaito Electronics USA . I mentioned my disappointment with the radios performance , and detailed the negatives mentioned in this review . <p> I asked Kaitos technician if I might- have received a defective unit ? He responded that my experience seems to be the norm with this particular production run . He , too , had noted muffled/garbled audio on shortwave and mediumwave . Per his request , I sent a detailed list of the KA108s shortcomings with suggested fixes . He is planning to send this to Kaitos current manufacturer in China . <p> The KA108s poor performance issues would likely be mitigated to a great extent , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widen the AM bandwidth <p> Tweak the AGC for greater- stability <p> Adjust the audio settings for the AM mode <p> Minimize/shorten muting between frequency changes <p> Improve internal shielding and grounding <p> And while they 're at it , - have the radio manual edited by a native English speaker <p> Since this is a DSP-based radio , I imagine the first four adjustments can be made- via firmware upgrades . <p> Time will tell if the second production run of the Kaito KA108 improves on the first . - Fingers crossed ! - Kaito , wed like you to succeed on this score . <p> I 'm disappointed for the same reasons you are . Hopefully the changes you suggested will be made by Kaito and those changes would make this one of the better small radios out there . In the mean time I 'll stay tuned to see what develops . Keep up the great work . <p> The mark of a good review is of course to show strengths and weaknesses I always appreciate your reviews because you do not merely trash something , but highlight what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has good intentions , but which obviously misses the mark by a fairly wide margin . Very thorough review as usual this is why you are a trusted source of information . I have purchased more than one radio because of your assessments ! Keep up the good work ! ! <p> Thank you ! I am glad this objective review sheds light on the pros and cons . You did me ( and others ) a great service . I do not understand why they put that mute in the tuning system , That is annoying . I have a Radio Shack DX-390 . I found the mute diodes and disconnected them as well as the piezo beeper also a " peep-peep " when you push the keys .. I will pass on the Kaito . You saved me bundle for a better radio . I wish they would have a service manual . I buy the service manual first , then get a good feeling for the innards and be out only the price of the service manual . I have manuals to appliances I never purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service manual too . <p> Thanks for the thorough review . You confirmed my suspicions . It takes considerable skill to integrate additional microcontroller logic into a radio without drowning it in RFI . That 's the reason you cant even find a decent external battery-powered speaker that you can connect to your radio without wiping out the incoming signal . Tecsun would be onto a winner if they integrated a recorder into their PL360/PL365 unit without compromising its reception performance . It certainly has enough room for a micro-SD card slot . Tecsun , I hope you 're listening ! <p> Even Grundig ( when it still was that iconic German radio maker ) failed at that when they unleashed their Satellit 300/400 models onto the unsuspecting SWL community . Particularly the lower bands suffered QRM from the processor a lot , most noticeable in SSB , not to mention all the birdies in between the noise . = <p> I 'm happy that someone else has had this same problem . I have several portable radios which I like to take to the local mountains for FM dxing . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like to connect them via 3.5mm cable to my various portable speakers . With the radios tuned in with clear sound my JBL Charge and Oontz XL will completely wipe out the incoming signal to nothing but static when plugged in . I also have some speakers that do not affect the radio output . I 've just always wondered what the difference is . <p> Did you try off tuning by one or two kHz to improve the audio ? As far as the off tuning does n't  attenuate the carrier , this should n't cause increased distortion , but you should get the higher tones from one or the other edge of the signal . <p> The off tuning trick works even in the Twente WebSDR . Try to receive an AM signal using the AM-nrw setting and tune off . This has similar effect on audio quality as making the bandwidth wider . In my opinion off tuning is preferred because one can select the better sideband for listening and because it does not increase processor loading . <p> I use the off tuning trick also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get rid off the soft muting in addition to the other benefits . <p> I am awaiting one via amazon.com . However , I did n't  buy it for the radio but for its ability to play mp3 files from a USB stick . See , I rip language courses from my CDs and wanted something small/handheld with a speaker to be easily able to move around with . From your review , it seems I made a good choice for my need . The radio is of no interest to me . In fact , I wish it did n't  even have radio abilities , so it could have been cheaper . <p> With shortwave radios like a Tecsun PL 600 and PL 680 around my place , I hardly needed a cheapo radio . <p> Yesfor your particular application , I think you will be satisfied . I think I 'm going to turn mine into a small mp3 player that simply feeds audio into my SStran AM transmitter . The battery life is pretty good ( not stellar , but good ) . Since it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum from a wall wart . <p> The good is the mp3 abilities . Using a USB stick with spoken word mp3s ( language lessons , lectures and downloaded radio shows ) , this proved to be a decent unit with good sound . The handheld size made it very portable for taking onto my balcony and relaxing with a cigar while listening . I wanted a small mp3 player with a speaker and got it . <p> The bad was the radio aspect . AM/FM is on a level with a sub $10.00 portable . For about half the price I get far superior AM/FM reception on my Sony IC38 ! The KA108 receives even local powerhouse stations with a little weakness . Useless . <p> Shortwave is an absolute joke , too . For the price , I can get superior reception elsewhere . For a little more money , I can get far superior reception . <p> While the speaker is fine on mp3s , it is horrible on the radio bands . Add too this the horrible muting problem that make you not want to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a totally useless radio . <p> Overall , this is an mp3 player . Under no circumstances buy this for the radio ( in ) abilities , or you will be very sorry . <p> This should have been released as a stand alone portable mp3 player . Adding the lousy radio aspect will probably cause this unit to lose sales , once the negative reviews get around . <p> If Kaito is smart , they will redo this unit without the radio , add the ability to navigate folders and re-release it as a small but feature packed handheld mp3 player . <p> Am I sorry I bought it ? No , because it does what I wanted . There are n't  many units out there that met my needs , a small portable mp3 player with a speaker . However , I do feel it is over-priced for its one good feature . <p> Review update : Do n't  buy this unit unless you need more aggravation in your life or an expensive paperweight ! <p> Within a couple of days of light use as an mp3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when you press the Play/Pause , FF or Rew buttons , it will send you back to the beginning of the track you were playing , regardless of which of the three buttons you press ! This is particularly bad when you are ten minutes into a thirty minute language lesson or lecture . Much of the rest of the time , the FF and Rew buttons may initially work properly UNTIL you remove your finger , at which time take a guess they will send you back to the beginning of the track you were listening to ! <p> Anyone who has ever done audio based language lessons will know that there are times you need to pause in order to repeat a sentence or word . At other times , you will want to rewind a few seconds to listen again to something which was said . Well , with the defective buttons , you will spend more time repeatedly trying to get back to the point where you were rather than playing mp3s . <p> I am returning this piece of trash to amazon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaito sh9ould immediately withdraw this unit from the market , as it is a piece of junk , especially for the price . In addition , retailers like amazon and Universal should return their stock and refuse to sell it , since it has gotten such lousy overall reviews . <p> Kaito knows what junk this is and still sent it out to the market . Shame on you , Kaito ! <p> I am gad I waited ! This baby was in my want list . I was started to see it was such a tiny baby ! My Grundig traveler and Tecsun PL-606 are no-nonsense no tricks radios withoud S card functions . I needed no-nonsense work radios in the same price range . I do n't  need to pay for hassles . Yoda <p> . some questions , Mr. Thomaswhy is " muting " such an undesirable issue , and if it comes as a radio ( dsp ) design , how can we ignore it or " fix " it so as not to bother the listener ? I do n't  understand " soft " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the design of the radio ? . I am a novice in this field , although I have owned a few radios ( Nordmende Galaxy , Sony Icf-7600 ) . rsvp and thanks ! <p> Muting is annoying because it makes band scanning ( tuning up and down the band , listening for stations ) slow and cumbersome . <p> On the KA108 , for example , as you tune up the band , each increment ( 5kHz , for example ) , you have to pause , wait for the audio to come back , then listen for signs of a signal . If no signal , then you move up one more step , then repeat the process . <p> Most of the quality portables on the market either have no muting between frequency changes , of the muting period is very short . On the PL-660 , for example , I can band scan very quickly because I can listen as I tunethere is not muting at all . Of course , true analog radios have no muting between frequencies either . <p> This can most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for this review . I 'm a huge fan of recordable radios , and was excited to see this one come along . I was hoping though that it woud be improved radio-wise over existing ones . Ill still likely buy oneI could sort of make out the AM audio in your videos , and I 'm fairly easy to please . Youve also made me want a Traveler III , though ! = <p> My KA108 arrived this week . Your great video clips had convinced me that I could live with the AM audio , and for the most part , I can understand voice on any decent AM signal . Some treble on top would be nice , but I do n't  want them to take out any of the nice thumping bass . For me the bass is a novelty in a radio this size . Having other DSP radios of this class , I knew what to expect in reception . The main nagging problem with all of mine is the severe mediumwave breakthrough across all of shortwave . This needs to be dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recordable radio is on the DE1121 . I hope we can see a good quality SW/MW/FM recordable before much longer ! <p> I have a G2 Reporter . I got mine on eBay for $60 , and Universals been closing them out for that price . For $60 I 'm very pleased , although here in the city , the DSP circuit gets overloaded by strong MW locals , so I have to keep the antenna short for SW listening here . On N9EWOs website I learned a GREAT trick for better battery life : in settings , change the radio from standby mode to sleep mode . MUCH better battery life when this is done ! The G2 Reporter is n't a super high performance radio , but I find it acceptable for my location , and the recording function makes it a must-have for me . <p> Great article . This is really a pity this good looking radio does n't  have a better SW and AM performance , but after reading your review there are no doubts and will not buy it . I have seem some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with internal birdies specially in AM . Thanks for saving me not only a few euros but also to be deceived again . <p> When I first saw a picture of the KA 108 , I hoped it was a repackaged Kaito/Degen 1103 <p> If they could get that sensitivity with better Audio including Tone Adjust for music or voice bass rolloff and add working SYNC and other controls for a high end portable- a great Radio could result . <p> I wish we can get superior versions of the Tecsun PL 880 and Grundig Satellit at $200 . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

I had desired to keep this under wraps until Ten Tec is reorganized , but there is too much speculation concerning the service department to continue without an announcement of some sort . <p> There is a myriad of things that must be accomplished before everything is formalized .

Please give us time to finalize these plans since there are so many business related issues to get through .

I want the company to flourish , and this would , I think , be a reasonable and fair policy on both sides of the table . It keeps customers returning to Ten Tec . <p> You have a lot of responsibility resting on your shoulders , Sir . Its not merely Pride that wants me to see an American Company in Tennessee remain : Its a matter of National strategic importance . <p> For me as a customer if the policy is not modified ? Its economically pretty much of a deal breaker . <p> The chances of success with any company is like trying to catch a fart in a windstorm ! !

Indeed a waste of resources and money <p> I think TenTec built its reputation on first , no penalty to self diagnose your problem and secondly , no penalty if you did try to repair it yourself . We hams should be able to at least open our radios or get an elmer to help us open it for a look see and simple diagnosis . On the other hand many of TenTecs newer radios are beyond the repair skills of the current ham population , just like the Icom , Yaesu , and Kenwood . Right now it is time for outside repair shops to get up to speed to handle our repairs at their current repair fees , possibly less than the New TenTec prices . Also prospective TenTec purchasers will be driven off by the negative publicity of these recent take overs and the uncertainty of a future existing TenTec . If the big three Japanese companies went through two sellouts in a few years and then made a similar announcement regarding their service fees and policies it would cast the same doubt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : products that enhance our hobby experience AND reasonably priced and available service . I have many older TenTec rigs and service them myself with the help of internet elmers . I will continue to buy Elecraft for my new rigs . They are so much like TenTec used to be in my experience . I wish the New TenTec well , but sadly see the handwriting on the wall . <p> Dave , I agree ! Recently I contacted Ten Tec Service department , and asked for service documentation for my Ten Tec to repair my Omni 7 failed encoders which had failed , and will fail again . The fellow happily sold me the replacement parts , and his advice was " good luck " and then that was the " Elmer " advice I received ! I love my Ten Tec Omni 7 , but am reluctant to hold on to it . I 've owned five previous Ten Tec transceivers , and each had its own personality regarding flawsbut that 's true with many . Reading the comments here makes me on edge as to keeping it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . I have had to fix/repair some of my MFJ tools and radios and even taught the service people things about their products that even they did n't  know ( and I am just an old retired family doctor without any electronics training ) . I still buy their products because when I get them working they are good value for the money and I learn something . Everything I have from MFJ is still being used in my shack and many items are used on a daily basis . They offer many things that no one else offers also . <p> If you are just going to insult American made items , why do n't  you buy stuff made in your own country ? ? ? Oh , , , your country does n't  make any neat stuff like the MANY excellent items made here in the USA over the last 70 plus years . The RX 10 was an entry level receiver that worked very well at the time and for the low price it was offered . MFJ has made some junk but to their credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not available in your country . <p> For many of us , Ten Tec had a great deal to do with the Service department and the professional knowledge of the TT product line and the kindness each of them provided to us over the years . When the company was still intact , my belief , is the need for the Service Department to make a huge profit was NOT a concern . Good service kept many of us buying Tennessee built rigs for decades . As it is , the new owner(s) want to make a profit from the Ser . Dpt. and I bet any of us in the same position would be just as eager to turn a dollar . I suspect the initial investment was very high . Let 's hope that manufacturing will be a big part of the TT business in the future and things will relax some . I suppose we should be grateful that someone is trying to keep Ten Tec going . I for one wish them the very best but encourage the new owners to understand the strength and history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in keeping TT customers loyal to the product line . Many of us have been customers for over 40 years . I hope Ten Tec is around for decades into the future . <p> I would like to have them back up and running , so I can get the schematics I need for the Jupiter they never repaired . They put in a different board that has NO schematics to go with it . The schematics that I have , have a MC1496C and the new board they put in that has not work , has NE612As in it . This is the circuit that I 'm having a problem with . The one I have is a Figure 4-6 and this schematic is not the right one for the board that they put in ? John Henery said they would take care of this when they get up and running . I would like to get old board back or one like it ? NOT a Happy HamKB1PIF I have all paper work to show when radio was sent in and the board replacement .. <p> After being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , I must say that no-one has ever made a worthwhile profit out of importing , selling and supporting Ten Tec products , unfortunately . Regarding the above announcement by Mike ; there may be many USA amateurs seeking Ten Tec repair service elsewhere at friendlier rates and with friendlier service policies . In addressing a few comments above , I should mention that I was instrumental in convincing many Chinese commercial radio manufacturers to start making amateur radios and I can tell you they have absolutely zero interest in setting up any service centres in any country outside China to support their products . The four big Japanese amateur radio manufacturers have absolutely nothing to worry about in that area . In saying that , they DO support me directly . I can also say that Yaesu , followed by Alinco , have been the most responsive in competing against Chinese amateur radio manufacturers . Both Yaesu and Alinco have always provided outstanding product support to me . Oh , Rudi at Emtronics phoned me some months ago to tell me he sold his tube/valve amplifier business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emtronics amplifiers in a more satisfactory manner for USA amateurs being based in the USA .

@@75207507 @3907507/ <p> In truth , I use quality rechargeable AA cells quite heavily ( mainly Powerex and Panasonic Enloops ) . If I am reviewing a radio , I buy fresh Energizer or Duracell AA alkaline batteries- to make sure the radio is receiving full voltage from the batteries during the evaluation . <p> But , on occasion , a cheap AA will suffice , right ? <p> Not these . <p> I put three in a shortwave portable in June- because all of my other batteries were in use . I had just planned to take the portable on a weekend trip . - Though it shouldnt have been a problem , I forgot and left the batteries in the radio . <p> Tuesday afternoon , I checked the batteries because they were already dead . Turns out they were already leaking ! - I then remembered- that other cellsfrom the same packhad leaked in one of my kids flashlights . <p> It could be that I simply got a bad batch of batteries , but these cells really do feel of poor qualityI bet they weigh half that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Free is too costly for these batteries . Stick with quality cells ! <p> Now I need to go through my house and find where the remaining four batteries- are hidden before they damage another device . <p> Good advice I had a similar problem with Walmart-branded batteries some years ago , as well as Radio Shack . I tend to stick with Duracell or Energizer . For some years I got away from rechargeables all together , preferring the full power of AA cells , avoiding drain during unused periods , and just being able to keep a bunch around . Now I have gone back to rechargeables where possible , using only Enloops , because of their ability to maintain a lengthy charge for those things which get used only occasionally . The reason ? I have had both Energizer and Duracell leak in products where they had only been in the radio or similar item for 6 months . That is unacceptable to me with todays technology . Obviously there is a lowering of the quality of these batteries , pushing people toward , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it is comparable to dishwasher detergents-have you noticed ? - you keep having to buy the latest greatest versions of them to get things truly clean . There are three or four levels of cleaners and only the top one gets things really clean , until that level is replaced with a " new and improved " top level , and suddenly only that formula really get things clean . Just one mans rant ! <p> These comments are contrary to my experience . I 've tried both their yellow jacketed heavy duty and their orange jacketed alkaline batteries with no problems . They consistently yield voltage greater than 1.5 . Usually around 1.8v . No leakages . <p> Same herethis was discussed ( and cussed ) at length on an Antique Radio Forum thread back in the summer . Bottom line : none of them are any good , even the name brands leak like a sieve . Found that out the hard way , even some new ones still well in date in the pack had leaked . The forum guys recommended checking all alkalines every six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is excellent since name brand alkalines now cost about as much , even at Wal-Mart . <p> While were fussing , has anyone else noticed todays alkalines do n't  seem to last as long ? Could it have something to do with the mercury being removed ? My Sony M37 Walkman appears to go longer on a AAA rechargeable than it did on an alkaline , for the same use . Brings back memories of the old carbon-zinc cells . <p> They will all leak , the good ones and the bad ones . I had a Davis Vantage Pro that I had Energizers in the console . They leaked and ruined the console AND the table it was sitting on . It cost Energizer big bucks . Because of their " no leakage " guarantee , they had to buy me a new Vantage Pro . The problem was by that time you could not purchase the same weather station so they had to buy me a new wireless Vantage Pro 2 at a cost of over $600.00 <p> As an old-timer I can remember dry cell batteries leaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest time they seemed to be better . Over the past several years the leaking has started again . Just like old times . <p> In a study of various battery types , one study said alkalines in general are prone to leakage .

To do this- first class , we need a 200K capital infusion for a new factory building and- some new equipment to replace that was liquidated if anyone cares to step up and accelerate our success . 400K would give us the facility , equipment- and capitol to put everything back in production to a stocking basis and- allow us to complete the Orion III . If 400 people will give us 1K each , we- will commit to the Orion III of your dreams in 18-24 months and give you 2K- off the target price of 5K as well as engrave your name and call on a- plaque on the new building that says you helped build it and save TEN TEC . <p> Where do I fit in ? <p> No , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can in the evenings- to ensure that TEN-TEC is a success . I want to see it be a success , and- maintain what can be maintained of the people , and improve its- image/products/etc back to where they were years ago . The owner is quite- insistent that I remain intimately involved with TEN-TEC even if it is on a- part time basis . It is my choice of how much or little I spend on TEN-TEC and the door is assuredly left open for me to come and go as I please . He- wants me to be the VP of Engineering , but , well , time will tell how all of- this plays out . <p> I am also working on digital modes for HRD , so , my evenings are quite- interesting . <p> In the future , who knows ? <p> Where do you fit in ? <p> Be patient , this is a total reboot of a company , ripping away the excess- that bleeds it dry ( e.g. high rent , using an MRP system that costs $$$$- monthly when something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing to- a cost effective internet/phone system , so many " luxuries " will be removed- and put in their place the necessities to get business going profitably ) , - and building the business and products with the key employees to make it- strong again . You build the employees , the employees build the company . But- it will take time . <p> The products are there , the technology is also there for the future ( some- things that were in the works that no one in the public knows about ) that- the new owner has a plan to finish soon . <p> Actually , TEN-TEC does need to take the time it will take to make it a- success . Otherwise if he runs headlong into this as was done in the past , - he will fail . If people buy rigs and amps and tuners and other accessories- elsewhere in the meantime , well , that is their decision . The market- continually has new and continued customers . existing customers- periodically look for something new , enough of a continual market that- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out that are planned include continuances of good- known technology , and of course some are a step ahead of what is in the- market today , and you will see those in 1-2-3 years . <p> I will not divulge nor answer speculation on anything further than what I- have stated above as to what products , when , etc . I can also tell you is- that the owner has emphatically stated to me that this the last time Ten- Tec will change hands for the next 15-20 years or so as he is my age and- plans for us both to operate it until we are in our 70s or physically- unable to continue , so Ten Tech could not be in the hands of anyone more- SERIOUSLY long term goal oriented . He has wanted Ten Tech for a long time- for the excellent DSP AGC technology built in to our transceivers so I- think it is safe to say that there will be future generations of the Omni , - and Orion style units as finances permit . But again in order for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by purchasing existing TEN- TEC products . Look for the Omni 7+ next year . <p> So , whereas he still wants to remain anonymous until his formal- announcement in the first quarter , I myself am convinced that this will- work , enough so to help him wherever I can , and so are the key core- employees at TEN-TEC . If anything , our message at this time is please be- patient with the negativity . There are other things happening behind the- scenes which can not yet be publically discussed before they are finished . <p> If this sounds like cheerleading , well , then so be it , I care about- TEN-TEC , the people , the legacy , and will do what I can to make it a- success , and , if this fails , well , we will give it a valiant effort . <p> Please understand that I have other commitments from now until Monday next- week that I may not be able to respond/answer questions until then . But do- realize , that I have disclosed about as much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I created , and the new owner gave me- inputs on , which items he felt like disclosing now , etc . So , there may be- some he/I/ours mixed up , but I hope the message from him is clear . TEN-TEC- is something he is passionate about , and is committed to making it a- success . Yes , there are trials and tribulations , but , he is convinced he- can do it , and I will do whatever I can to assist , and so will various core- TEN-TEC individuals . <p> 73 , KI4JPL <p> John Henry <p> This is a most interesting development . As many of you know , I 've always loved Ten-Tec equipmentI consider their amateur radio receivers to be some of the best on the market . Its been a tough few years for them and I certainly hope the new owner can inject some energy and innovation behind the brand. - I will post updates as they become available . <h> 28 thoughts on " Ten-Tec has a new owner with long-term vision " <p> I have a somewhat disheartening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a one owner RX-340 , and kept it for a while , but last year decided to sell it ( I have detailed my reasons for doing so in some FB posts , in favor of a NRD-545 ) . But before I did sell , I decided to send it to Ten Tec because it had started exhibiting drift , slight drift , but there nonetheless . I did what I considered to be a good job of packing the receiver , and sent it down to Ten Tec . My thread of emails to Ten Tec began in November and it was n't until some time in January that I sent it . To start , I should say that the Ten Tec technician was fairly helpful in the beginning , sending instructions on BITE testing , which I did perform but revealed no errors . When the receiver got there , they did confirm its arrival but only after a few emails from me , and they reported a turnaround time of " about 4 weeks " . Then from roughly the end of January to February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was little or no communication , until one that said they had performed only a power reset , and repaired the rear coaxial connector , which they claimed was due to my own mis-packing ( which I frankly doubted at the time , and still do ) . Then there were emails referring to some " major ice storm " which had closed the Ten Tec offices . My emails stop at that point , but at some point in the days after I finally received the RX-340 back . There was no reference to any realignment work having been done on the receiver , which was the reason for my shipping it to them in the first place . And the drift was still there as if nothing had been done at all to the receiver , though they charged me several hundred dollars , apparently only for a " power reset " . I ended up with a damaged rear coaxial connector , and a receiver still with drift . Again , I proceeded with selling the radio , primarily because I had decided it was inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson receiver . But overall , the experience with Ten Tec service left a bad taste , and on that basis alone I would not purchase again from them . Others may have had five star experiences with their service department . I did not . <p> That is very unfortunate , Dan . Did the repair work take place this year ? I ask because ever since they moved to their new location , I 've found some of the staff unresponsive . I think many were preparing to flee the ship . <p> In September , I went to the W4DXCC convention in Sevierville . I called Ten-Tec and asked if I could stop by and take a few pics of their new offices and assembly areas . ( In the past , I knew key people at Ten-Tec and they knew meI would n't have even called to say that I was popping in . ) The front desk person told me shed have to clear that with their corporate office in Colorado first . She tols me shed call back later that afternoon . <p> When I arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave ( a ham ) . He said , " They wont call you back . Theyre owned by Alpha . Alpha does n't  return calls . " He was right , too . Never got a call back . <p> Well before I knew the Ten-Tec staff , though , and before I had become a Beta tester for their transceivers , I owned an OMNI VI+ . Beautiful rig . I bought it used from someone who had only operated it for one year and wanted an Icom Pro III . The rig was in mint condition . <p> I did notice that the OMNI had a little encoder noise when the RF was turned down and the AF turned up . They recommended I bring it in so they could take a look . I simply drove it the 1.5 hours to their repair shop . I dropped it off in the late morning and picked it up early afternoon . <p> Paul , their service manager , went over all they had done : checked and re-worked board grounding , an alignment and full check up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niose was within spec , but they were able to minimize it a bit more ( and they did ) . Those beautiful LED displays were simply a little noisy when paired with a very sensitive receiver . <p> I ( internally cringed and then ) asked , how much did the repair cost ? Paul said , " nothingits on us . " <p> I hope under the new owner and leadership , Ten-Tec service is brought back to its previous level . My experience with them was always five star . <p> Really hate to hear your story , Dan . Sounds like you did everything right and the process only caused frustration and an extra outlay of cash . No fun . <p> Opinions free of charge : TenTec has always had great design and build quality , but the only areas I see as innovative are their Rebel and Patriot radios . TenTec has consistently ignored the all-mode VHF-UHF amateur markets in favor of HF rigs that do n't  compete well with the big 3 . The Eagle , a fine looking rig , is twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more amateur satellites are being launched but the pickings are slim on new rigs to work the birds . HF propagation is in the sink much of the time these days and hams are looking for new stuff to do . TenTec should support this . <p> Another way to get ahead of the big 3 would be the portable SDR transceiver action happening in the maker movement . TenTec did take some tentative ( hi ) steps in new directions when they became a dealer for YouKits a company that is constantly experimenting and revising but that relationship seems to have ended . <p> I do not see that focusing on more Omnis , Orions and amplifiers is going to take this company very far . <p> I sent a Jupiter to them a few years back and they said it was all repaired and sent it back . It still did n't  work . Same problem .. It was tested by Paul Clinton and sign off as all okay . I tired to repair the DSP board but that proved not good . So I ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 247.00 . I got the board and installed it in the radio and then things started working . I could not get the radio to change Modes in menu . I called them and they said to send it in and they would fix it . I sent it in and they said it was finished and I sent the money . When the radio came back it did n't  work . Transmitt was the problem .. this was back in Dec 2012 . There was problem with the PA and friend of mine had to repace a LM 358 on the PA board . He fead 4 watts at the preamp pin 1 and got a 100 watts out . The parts that they put in was a 32127 encoder and a circuit board # 81962 , and I cant find any info on thios board .. Modes were made to the preamp Transistor 2SC1971 to a RD06hhF-1 . On this board there are tw0 NE612A and on the schematics that I have has two MC1496Ds and there was some modes made to the circuit board to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to send to TEN-TEC but have not got an answer from them .. I have own this radio from 2012 and has not work from the time I sent it to Ten-Tec back in 2012 .. With that kind of servive they should not start back up if they cant give good servive to people that own their equipment . I own Kenwoods and I repair them and the best radio that I rebuild it the 940S and I have alot of them in my shopWORKING.KB1PIF <p> Al Kahn had started Electrovoice in the 1920s , then cofounded Ten-Tec in 1968 . I 'm not sure what happened ( I think I did know once upon a time ) , but I assume Electrovoice got too big , or Al retired . And Ten-Tec was something to do . <p> It was a time of every one wanting high power , so QRP was like a chance to do something new ( like " ultralight dxing is today ) , helped along because it was still easier to use transistors for low power . So Ten Tec came along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in kit form ) , but also nifty cabinets and I think the modules in cabinets . All were very simple , direct conversion receivers ( these were ham band only ) and various transmitter modules , CW only and mostly crystal controlled . Some of the target seemed to be US novice licensees , which at the time were limited to 75 watts , CW and small segments of 80 , 40 and 15 metres . <p> Eventually they went to a more formal equipment , they had a four band direct conversion receiver for about a hundred dollars by 1971 . But it took some time before there was any superheterodyne receivers , or SSB equipment . I think it was the Argo , circa 1974 , an SSB transceiver with 5 or 10 watts output . <p> And for what seemed like a long time ( at the time ) , it remained simple and low power . They did continue with CW only equipment alongside the SSB stuff . <p> They started as the traditional ham companies were fading out , eventually becoming a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except it was always HF equipment . <p> Al Kahn died in 2005 , I 'm not sure I knew the company was under new ownership . But its a transition time , the original owner gone , new ownership coming in . It sounds like the first new owner let things slip ( were they closing things own , that talk of a liquidation sale makes me wonder ) , and now another new owner . <p> Tat may not improve things , but on the other hand , it may mean a return to previous greatness . Why bother buying it if they are n't  going to keep it going ? <p> Really disappointed at this latest bit in a string of bad news from TT . When they announced their impending move last year , coupled with discounted prices on their few remaining products and a merger with Alpha , I think many of us knew something was up . Damage control by John Henry soon followed in the form of positive-sounding explanations . And now he mentions a GoFundMe account and the need to raise $400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Elephant in the room is being ignored . That elephants name starts with an E and is based in California . They seem to be doing everything right , not only in rig design but in customer service as well . Even the company owners participate in interacting with customers online for all to see regarding problems , feature requests , etc . If TT gets going again , this is what they will have to compete with as E has raised the bar on what customer service means . And will potential TT buyers trust that the follow-up care will be there in terms of tech support , spare parts , etc ? We no longer look to a manufacturer to simply design and sell us a $$$ radio we also need to know that our investment will still be operational down the road and that its value will hold . I have no doubt my E rig will be supported years from now that confidence in TT is non-existent . <p> I really hate the horror stories we have been recently been hearing about Ten Tec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave because of health issues . Paul Clinton , however continues to be very helpful at answering questions and parts . I enjoy working on the older Ten Tec gear for customers . Many times here recently , we have been able to source parts from other places after Ten Tec has told me that this or that part is not available aka unobtainium . Recently my health has been up and down so we are really backed up on repairs . Also , I am finding more work than we can get done . I will just cross my fingers , and hope for Ten Tec to have a great turn around and get back on top or their game . No matter what happens , my model 586 Paragon will never be for sale . It would be a big shame to see Ten Tec go the same direction Heathkit did . Ten Tec service has always been Legendary and second to none as far as I am concerned . We are wishing the new owner/s the very best of luck . Why he wants to hide his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would be shouting about it from every rooftop we could find . 73 de Wade/KJ4WS <p> I have always wanted to buy a new Ten Tec radio ( got into radio age 12 now 76 ) . But from the out set I have heard how hard it is to get service from Ten Tec on their radios once you have purchased one . First tried on the phone . Solid state transievers are not that simple to most of us . And it was then shipped back to the factory and the turn around time , according to owners , was just too long . In all those years , even though ten tec cost more , if it was not for this I would have bought one . I think Ten Tec is a beautiful radio ; inside and out . Joe W. Davis N4EJF <p> Does anyone have an update on the possible new owner buyout of Ten Tec ? We need to keep this US company from going under . I want to see them back building a full range of ham gear including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I sent a Jupiter ( Green Screen ) in for service near the end of Feb or early March 2016 . The rig was gone appx two weeks when I received a call from Ten-Tec that the service was complete . Its back on the air . While it was gone I had my trusty old Omni C fired up and digging out dx on 40 cw . <p> Ive used Ten Tec equipment since the mid 70s with good results until present . Two years ago ( Summer of 14 ) I sent a nice Orion back to Tennessee to have the display replaced as it had vertical lines thru it . In spite of multiple calls , no fix was provided . At about 18 months , ( late Fall of 15 ) I was called to inform me that the radio was totally trashed , needed the receiver repaired and aligned , needed new finals in the transmitter ( they went to far as to say someone had replaced the finals with incompatible parts and would never work anyhow ) and was probably NOT worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack of lies as I TALKED ON THE RADIO the night before I sent it in . How stupid do these people really think we are ? ? ? <p> My remedy for this problem is that I have switched to other radios I own and sincerely hope they enjoy their new Orion as I will NOT pay for being lied to by people who are trying to burn me on repairs . I 've sold all of my Ten Tec equipment and will never be burned again by these liars . Its such a shame that the USA companies can t produce radios and service them while treating their customers with honesty and integrity . RIP Ten Tec as I am DONE ! ! ! <p> I 'm sorry to hear about the Orion . I recently had a Jupiter serviced by Ten Tec and it came back in great operating condition . I bought my first Ten Tec gear in 1980 and have used T-T only since then , other than amplifiers . <p> Ten-Tec is probably finished . The new owner has found gold in the commercial/military stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanged for over a year now . As a HUGE fan of Ten Tec gear , this is sad , but in my search for a NEW rig , I 'm off to Elecraft now . Ca n't wait forever for Ten Tec to come out with something new . <p> This is what happens when sooo many hams go and by Japanese radios . The END of American gear .. thanks to all who sent their money to the Big Three . <p> I have the Jupiter and Delta 580 and all the hams that come to my shack marvel at what I can hear and work , I use the Ten-Tec mic with their true RF speech processor . I would like to buy another Ten-Tec so you guys get rolling , you have 1 order pending . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

@@75207513 @3907513/ <h> Initial review of the Sangean ATS-405 <p> Just last week , I received the new Sangean ATS-405- on loan from Universal Radio . Though Ive only had the radio for a week , I thought I 'd share a few un-boxing photos ( by request ) and my initial impressions/review of this radio . <h> Unboxing <p> The ATS-405 comes with a thick owners manual ( in five languages ) , a 7.5 volt AC adapter , and a soft radio case . The package does not contain rechargeable batteries nor a clip-on wire antenna ( like many Tecsun products do , for example ) . <p> Overall , the packaging accommodates the radio and accessories efficiently and would probably- ship- safely even if the carrier does n't  handle it with particular care . <p> The first thing I noticed about the ATS-405 is the near-identical design and layout Sangean has used in their design of- past shortwave radios . If you 're a Sangean fan , you 'll find all of the functions , buttons , and labels pretty much in the same place ; virtually no learning curve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I installed- a fresh set of AA batteries in it and turned on the radio <h> Display <p> Like most Sangeans , the display is crisp , - clear and can easily be read straight-on or at low angles , like when the radio is resting on its back stand , for example . If you look at the display from a higher angle , however , you 'll find that the LCD digits nearly disappear . <p> Back-lighting is perfect : its soft and consistent across the display , very much like the ATS-909X . <h> Audio <p> Audio from the internal speaker is good . Its in the same league with most similarly-priced competitors . <h> Receiver performance <p> Keeping in mind that I 've only logged a few days of listening time on the ATS-405 , I do have some initial impressions about receiver performance across the bands : <p> Right side view ( click to enlarge ) <p> FM <p> On a positive note , I believe FM performance is quite good . Perhaps not in the same league with my PL-660 or PL-680 , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up my distant benchmark FM stations with ease , though to help with the signal lock , I had to switch from stereo to mono reception . <p> AM/Mediumwave <p> AM reception is a bit of a mixed bag . I find that the 405s overall sensitivity and selectivity are quite good for broadcast band listening . <p> When I first tuned around on the AM broadcast band , however , I found the noise floor a little too- high . Regardless of- whether I was tuned in to a station or not , there was an ever-present high-pitched hiss , like- static . It was quite disappointing , especially since I read a review by Jay Allen that really complimented the AM performance on the ATS-405 . <p> I trust Jays reviews , however , so I promptly contacted him. - Jay pointed out that the problem may be that I was- listening in the default " wide " filter setting on AM . And indeed , he was rightthough I had changed filter settings a few times while tuned to local stations , I had moved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The ATS-405 , by the way , has three filter settings : wide , medium and narrow . ) <p> Left side view ( click to enlarge ) <p> But the wide setting is really too wide , and was certainly the source for the bulk of the high-pitched hiss I heard . The best filter setting for most broadcast band listening is the middle position , which sounds like a 5-6 kHz filter . In the middle position , noise is decreased significantly . I also believe selecting the " music " audio tone setting helps dissipate some of the noise . <p> Regarding- the noise floor : to be clear , I still feel like the noise level is slightly more noticeable , to my ear , on the ATS-405- than on the- PL-660 , PL-600 , and PL-310ET when band-scanning or weak signal listening . This is most likely some- internally-generated noise that somehow still meets Sangeans engineering spec . <p> Local AM stations sound fantastic , and the ATS-405 can detect- all of my benchmarks . AM audio fidelity is better than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a local station , the noise floor also seems to disappear. - For some reason , I even find that the ATS-405 does a better job receiving- local AM stations from indoors " even near noisy electronics " than other sub-$100 portables with which I 'm familiar . <p> Uh-oh , - birdies <p> The most disappointing discovery I made- on the Sangeans AM broadcast band is that it has DSP birdies. - Birdies are internally-generated noises- resulting from the outputs of the oscillators that form part of the DSP receiver circuit . While almost all receivers do have birdies somewhere in the receivers reception range , radio engineers try to- keep them out of the way of the important parts of the band . <p> Unfortunately , my ATS-405 has- strong DSP birdies on 800 and 1600 kHz . This is a big negative for me , since my favorite regional AM broadcast station is located on 1600 kHz ( WTZQ ) . Rather than attempting to describe what the birdies sound like , here are a few- audio clips that will give you an idea " I start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of good AM reception : <p> The ATS-405s birdies- almost sound like a jamming signal on 1600 kHz. - Indeed , - if this station were only located on a different frequency , I 'm sure- it- would be quite audible on this radiotoo bad . <p> Birdies on 800 and 1600 kHz may very well be deal-breakers for many of us . Again , since one of my favorite regional independent broadcasters is on 1600 kHz , its a deal-breaker for me . <p> Jay specifically mentioned a lack of birdies on the AM broadcast band in his review . It could very well be that he does n't  hear them on his particular receiver " variations in quality control- on a radio production line are certainly a real phenomena ( the Grundig G3 is a case in point ) . This could indicate that some units may have pronounced birdies while others do n't  . If you purchase an ATS-405 , I would check to see if your unit has birdies after powering it up . <p> When I contacted an engineer for Sangean North America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are , indeed , DSP birdies. - I may ask- Sangean if they can send another ATS-405 for comparison . <p> On a more positive note , I checked harmonics in the HF/shortwave bands and heard no DSP birdies there . <p> One additional- question I posed to Sangean : where is the ATS-405 made ? One reader- told me the radios are produced in both Taiwan and China . Thinking variations in quality control may be accounted for by two different production lines , I checked my radio to see where it was made . Unfortunately , my unit has no mention of country of origin ; not on the radio , the box , the manual , behind the battery cover , nor on the back stand . Its possible it could be marked internally , but I did n't  want to take apart a receiver Ive been loaned . <p> Sangean came back with a firm answer : <p> " I can confirm that the ATS-405 , along with all our radios , are manufactured in China . We have an office in Taipei for engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a big surprise here ; I expected China was the country of origin . <p> To sum up AM performance : if you are n't  bothered by the birdies on 800 and 1600 kHz , - or if your unit is n't producing them , - you 'll find the ATS-405 a capable little AM broadcast band- receiver . <h> Shortwave <p> Our HF propagation conditions since last Friday ( when I first turned on the ATS-405 ) have been poor . Other than a few short band openings , I 've struggled to hear anything other than the normal blow-torch broadcasters we hear in North America. - Still , bad propagation conditions are actually good for reviewing some aspects of a shortwave receiver , so I used the opportunity . <p> In terms of sensitivity on the shortwave bands , I think the ATS-405 is mediocre . It lags behind my Tecsun PL-660 , PL-600 , PL-310ET , and CC Skywave . Adding a clip-on wire antenna to the telescoping whip ( there is no aux antenna port ) does help in terms of sensitivity . <p> Since I do most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , is- a deal-breaker for me . If you primarily listen to stronger shortwave stations , or spend most of your time on the FM/AM bands , then you might still consider the ATS-405 . <p> The ATS-405s selectivity seems to be on par with my other DSP-based portables . In truth , though , band conditions have been so unfavorable , I do n't  feel like I 've had ample opportunity to test selectivity . Ill likely follow up this initial review with an update . <p> And as on- medium wave , the noise floor on the shortwave bands seems a little high to me " especially with the filter set to- the " wide " position . <h> Cool , innovative features <p> While I clearly havent been wowed by the ATS-405s shortwave performance , I have been more favorably impressed with some of its innovative features : specifically , the ability to control- squelch , tuning mute , and soft mute . <p> Using the menu button ( see image above ) , you can engage or disengage the tuning mute and soft mute by pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keypad , then using the tuning up/down buttons to toggle these features on and off. - Squelch works the same way , using the " 1 " button and volume control to set the threshold . <p> This menu- control works regardless whether the radio is turned on or off . <p> Of course , by using the menu button and the keypad , you can also control the 405s tuning steps , AGC , clock , and backlighting functionality ; each of- these are marked in green next to the appropriate button on the keypad ( see image above ) , a very useful feature . <p> I wish other radio manufacturers would give users the ability to control some of the DSP chips built-in functionality , as the 405 does with the mutingespecially since over-active soft muting has been the downfall of several DSP-based radios . Thanks for trail-blazing , Sangean ! <h> Summary <p> Invariably , all radios have strengths and weaknesses ; here is a list of my notes from the moment I put the ATS-405- on the air : <p> I 'm going to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'd like to give it a more thorough test on the shortwave bands . I hope to follow up with a post offering a- few representative recordings . <p> My nutshell opinion of the ATS-405 so far is that its a decent little radio with a lot of functionality and features for a rig in its price class. - But overall , its performance seems to me rather- mediocre . If you primarily listen to FM , you 'll be pleased . If you 're a mediumwave listener , you 'll be pleased only if you do n't  mind the 800/1600 kHz DSP birdies . If you 're primarily a shortwave listener , you 'll need to carry a clip-on wire antenna to bring the sensitivity up to the level of similarly-priced receivers . <p> In short , I do want to like this radio unreservedly . But it appears that Sangean may need to pull up its socks on their- quality control . - Readers : please comment if you 've purchased the ATS-405 " I 'm very curious to learn whether there are- QC discrepancies in performance from one unit to the next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sangean kindly agreed to dispatch a second unit for comparison. - <p> Once I see the words " mixed bag " when reading a radio review the chance of me buying it = zero . Too bad because I absolutely love my Sangean ATS 909 and have had that radio for years with great performance . <p> I 've owned the ATS-405 for about 10 days . No birdies on 800/1600 . I would ask the reviewer to take the radio outside , away from the house by a good 50 feet and see if any birdies exist . Computers also being made in China are quite RF leak-prone . Mixed bag is not accurate . Away from the House , the set is exemplary . Inside the House mixed bag , but understand that any PL-310/380/505/606 would be intolerable in certain spots on the AM-band , like below 580kHz ( deaf ) and on certain CATV QRM regions , and Computer QRM locations . IMHO the QRM levels impact this , and most any other very-good or better receiver . The brutal test here is WGR 550kHz some 320 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PL-310 , and receivable with some QRM backgrounded on the ATS-405 . The settings used will also contribute to a good or bad reception . <p> MHO : I suspect in the long run that there will be many ill-advised reviews of the 405 , as reception settings can be made to appear both good and bad . /MHO <p> I thought the same thing about the birdies , so when I first discovered them , I walked at least 100 feet from my house and they persisted . They 're the same level , so matter where I 'm located . 800 kHz is a little less noticable than 1600 kHz , which is quite strong . <p> If your ATS-405 does n't  have birdies , though , this indicates there well may be variations in quality control . <p> Since Paul and Jay got good samples of the ATS-405 , this implies that yours suffers from QC issues . <p> Its possible some of the metal shields are n't  soldered down properly . I think Jay Allen had this problem with a recent Grundig radio that he reviewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up doing the QC testing on modern radios . <p> I agree , Gary . In fact , Monday morning , I 'm going to contact Sangean and see if theyll send me another for comparison . Variations in QC are certainly a reality . I was just speaking with the owner of a ham radio store who said that the first and last production runs are the most prone . <p> Thomas ; S# 51007238 on radio and box . I had to travel about 1/2 mile away to get clear of Household QRM ( large parking lot daytime ) . I have a weak Station daytime 800 WLAD , and WWRL 1600 no blips/chirps heard . <p> I 've heard back from a number of people whove stated that they hear no birdies or internally-generated noise on 800 and 1600 kHz . I strongly suspect my unit is simply a lemon . <p> Sangean has dispatched a sample for comparison . <p> I 'm certain that the review unit I used in this particular review has internally-generated birdies because I 've heard them throughout regional travels I 've done over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First thing I will check when I receive the new Sangean ATS-405 are birdies and noise floor levels . <p> I must update my initial findings about the ATS-405 in one important respect . <p> I have birdies but not on 800 or 1600 kHz exactly . Thus I did not hear them when properly tuned . This took a bit of time as I was not checking into detuning signals for listening tweaks . With Soft-mute defeated this got put lower on the list of things to do . But I got there , and the birdies manifested themselves . And they are birdies . <p> In brief I would ask those responders/owners without birdies to try the following steps ; 1 . ) Set to AM-BCB 2 . ) Set AGC to Auto 3 . ) Engage fine tuning ( 1kHz step ) 4 . ) Tune to 1600 and press the up-arrow to fine tune/offset 5 . ) If you get no birdies , try tuning lower than 1600 kHz in the same manner <p> What I found was that at 1605 kHz on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 802/803 kHz . YRMV , or have none at all . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207515 @3907515/ <h> Shortwave Radio Recordings : Voice of Greece <p> Early this morning , around 01:14 UTC , I tuned to 9,420 kHz with the Elad FDM-S2 and heard the Voice of Greece for the first time since the Greek national broadcaster , - ERT had been restored . <p> SWLing Post contributor , Richard Langley , also noted the strong signal from Greece . - He has kindly shared the following information which he also posted in the DXLD Yahoo group : <p> " Greece is back on 9420 kHz this evening after being absent for some days and is now carrying the Voice of Greece - program and not ERT from Athens or Thessaloniki . Noted with good signals in eastern Canada at 01:40 UTC . Radio audio is about half a minute delayed with respect to Internet stream : ( http : **32;865;TOOLONG ? ) . Not noted on other frequencies . <p> 9420 kHz signed off just after 02:00 UTC . Internet stream continued . And I should correct myself when I mentioned " not ERT from Athens or Thessaloniki . " Should have said not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hellenic Radio , as opposed to ERT which stands for Hellenic Radio-Television . ERT1 , ERT2 , etc. are TV stations while ERA1 , ERA2 , etc. are radio stations . This is a bit like BB1 , BBC2 , , and BBC Radio 1 , BBC Radio 2 , and so on . " <p> Richard followed up a few hours later : <p> " I continued listening to the Internet stream after the SW transmission ended , and at 02:57 UTC , the station identified itself in both Greek ( " Edo Athina , I Foni T is Elladas " ) and English ( " This is Athens . You are listening to the Voice of Greece " ) several times , followed by the traditional interval signal and then what I believe to be the Greek national anthem at 03:00 UTC . A program of Greek music then ensued . " <p> Many thanks for sharing the details , Richard . - My recording actually ended when VOG signed offI suppose I caught about the last 46 minutes of the broadcast . <h> 8 thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an example of how slowly the old , corrupt structures die in Greece . <p> For decades Greece spent much more money than it earned . The old broadcasting system is a typical example of how the governing parties created jobs for their followers and after the next election the other party added theirs , too . <p> The real purpose of " Voice of greece " is to distribute money as described above . Or has anyone of you heard much more than Greece music and a station announcement now and then ? Compare it to Radio Romania , from another poor county on the Balcans . <p> Remember : This station is " financed " by a state that has been bankrupt for years . I will be forced to pay my share of this dept personally in the near future I hope in the very near future and not a lot more in a few more years . <p> Lots of corrupt structure in WB , IMF , Goldman Sachs , etc too . Lots of their demands will only make a few rich men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At least they get their radio transmitted over Europe and over the world , unlike Germany which by next year will have their radio barely heard in Germany and certainly not outside it And will the German taxpayers save any money from that ? Certainly not . <p> This station , and the ERT as a whole , is not financed by the goverment , but by the TV licence ( something like the german GEZ ) which is paid with the electricity bill .

The only difference is that this tax is gathered a different way . <p> What do you need to air a program like " Voice of Greece " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of possibilities to earn black money during erection and operation of such a thing . It could even be interesting to know who owned the land before . But that might prove difficult to evaluate in a country without a land registry . <p> A few people to watch the transmitter . <p> A PC with a MP3 player on random shuffle . <p> A few 100 MP3 files , mostly with folklore music and a few station announcements . <p> An Internet connection to insert a news broadcast from a national program from time to time . <p> A larger number of people creating and managing " international broadcasts " . <p> Did I forget anything ? <p> BTW : OK , I think it is an big error to turn off all of our AM and SW transmitters .

At about 24 after , a sign off message lasting roughly 3 minutes is read in the language of whatever service was on . If the frequency you 're listening will switch to another service at 30 after the hour , the carrier goes dead/unmodulated for almost exactly 3 minutes before the next language comes on . And the process is repeated over again . <p> The English service sign off message is read by a male in very stilted , very proper english . It sounds as if the French , German and Spanish service is voiced by people who could very well be native speakers of those languages . <p> There is no carrier being turned off or fill music being used between different language services on Shortwave .

From what I remember over a span of many years it is usually directed for the Eastern Russia and somehow the signal travels over the polar region to get here And just as any other propagation over very strong magnetic/particle fields it will have a substantial flutter most of the time . <p> If you start searching the bands around 12:00 UTC and tune in to 15180 , you should be able to pick them up , depending on your equipment , antenna and propagation conditions .

Like Paul says , for us on the west coast , theyll always be found , usually at excellent levels , although electrical problems in NK often result in distorted transmissions . <p> The dirty/noisy carrier is not an electrical problem .

@@75207522 @3907522/ <p> On a side note , I suppose I should mention that I was pretty disappointed with the DE1129 because I had hopes it would make for a great all-in-one portable radio recorder for ETOW . While the DE1129 could record FM/AM and SW radio directly , it had serious problems : it auto-adjusted the volume level during recording ( one could not turn off the internal speaker ) , it degraded audio quality in recording , and medium wave was plagued with a " ticking " sound every 10 seconds . It produced digital hash on various meter bands . My summary of the DE1129 : - fine- concept , poor engineering . Read my full review of the first version of the DE1129 here . <h> The Kaito KA29 : First impressions <p> The Kaito KA29 is a cute little portable . Mine has a black body with orange band encircling the diameter . That orange band is actually a nice addition " it helps- the radio show up a bit better and makes the ports a little easier to see when lighting is low . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard plastic body has a smooth matte quality and the buttons have a very tactile response . The telescopic whip antenna is long for the overall radio size , but is still a little on the short side for good HF gain . Oddly , unlike most radios , the antenna can not swivel at its point of attachment to the chassis ; it can only be extended and tipped- side-to-side " but not front to back , or back to front . Like the DE1129 , the KA29 lacks a back stand " a- big negative in my book " but admittedly a back stand would be of little use while SWLing with this rig because the antenna ca n't be swiveled or tipped into a useful vertical position . Hm. - Also like the DE1129 , - the KA29 uses a slim rechargeable battery pack . <p> When I first turned on the KA29 , I thought I had received a faulty- unit : I pressed and held the power button for a second , the display lit- up a bright green , I released the power buttonand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that the KA29 requires holding the power button a full two seconds , until the " Kaito " brand name appears on the display . <p> Unfortunately , the KA29 antenna does not swivel . <p> This sluggish power-up response is truly an indicator of most functions on the- KA29 . Its as if every function is controlled by a slow processor " which I 've no doubt is the case . <p> As far as I can tell , all the menu functions are the same on the Degen DE1129 ; obviously , they 're built on the same firmware . Indeed , Kaito is the North American brand for- the Chinese manufacturer , Degen ; the Degen model number for this radio is DE29 . In this sense , most functions are- familiar to me . <h> Tuning <p> The one added feature of the KA29 that my version of the DE1129 did n't  have is a number pad , useful for direct entry of radio frequencies . I should note here that I ( typically ) toss the owners manual aside when I first get a radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent quality time with the KA29 while traveling- a few weeks ago , and as I didnt- bring the manual , I had to learn its functions via trial and error . It was n't until I returned that I learned- how to use direct frequency entry ; the is answer clearly stated- in the manual : just key in the frequency , then press the appropriate band ( AM/FM/SW ) to go to that frequency . Pretty simple , actually . The response time for the radio to start playing the frequency you enter is only about one second . <p> Use of- the tuning knob ( located on the right side of the radio ) is easy and straightforward " tuning up and down will move- the needle- 5 kHz steps between frequencies . Unfortunately , as on the DE1129 , 5 kHz is the smallest tuning step available . - The KA29 briefly mutes between frequency changes , so when tuning slowly its very noticeable . - If you tune quickly , the KA29 will produce- snippets of audio as you pass signals , but I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short ? Though I suppose it could be worse , I do not like tuning the KA29 . <p> I should also mention that the KA29 has no adjustable bandwidth ; - I 'm guessing the AM bandwidth is stuck at around- 6 or 7 kHz . <h> Performance <p> While I no longer- have the DE1129 in hand for side-by-side comparison , my impression is that- performance between the two radios is very similar . <p> Audio fidelity <p> Herein lies the strength of the KA29 . It obviously uses the same speaker technology ( with an acoustic chamber ) that the DE1129 uses . You will be favorably impressed with the audio from this wee radio " it is quite robust for a pocket radio of this size , and in a small room , almost- room-filling . It sounds fantastic on FM and AM alikeyou can even hear a hint of bass . One day , I tuned the KA29 to a local AM station and listened quite comfortably in another room . Impressive . <p> But what about receiver performance ? <p> FM <p> FM performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different cities , and found that it could detect- most of the same FM stations my other portables picked up . <p> AM/Medium Wave <p> I was pleasantly surprised to note the- absence- of the annoying ticking sound I heard in the DE1129 ; - it appears Degen engineers have succeeded in eliminating this distraction . In general , I believe the KA29 performs acceptably on medium wave for basic local and nighttime clear channel broadcast listening . The AGC circuit is not ideal , though , for any sort of medium wave DXing ; - do n't  consider the KA29 for MW DX . <p> Shortwave <p> If the KA29 is better than the DE1129 on the shortwave bands , the improvement is negligible . Youll be fairly happy with the KA29 while listening to strong shortwave broadcasts . During my review , I listened to the new Global 24 a few hours on 9,395 kHz " an easy catch on the east coast of North America " and- the KA29 was fairly stable , producing rich audio . <p> Here are the cons on shortwave : <p> Automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the KA29 to be somewhat- sensitive , but again , the AGC circuit is just too active to listen comfortably for very long . <p> Noise floor <p> The noise floor is more obvious while listening to weak signals : I believe much of the noise is coming from the internal electronics of the KA29 . It produces an audible digital hash sound that makes weak-signal listening a bit of a chore . <p> Images <p> Quite often as I tuned around the- shortwave bands , I noticed that- FM stations bleed through the audio . Check out this audio sample as I attempted to listen to Radio Ryhad : <h> Onboard Recording <p> Fortunately , several- of the recording problems I noted with the DE1129 are no longer an- issue- with the KA29 . <p> Fixed volume <p> The DE1129 , when- recording- radio , had the exceedingly annoying habit of- automatically setting the internal speakers volume to a high level . While recording , this could not be changed . <p> Fortunately , this problem has mostly been addressed in the KA29 , which does not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume at the level set at the recordings start . I did n't  find this to be much of a problem . <p> Audio quality <p> The recording performance is better than that of the DE1129 , which produced noisy , muffled recordings . - The KA29 will produce fair- audio recordings on AM , on FM , and on- shortwave. - One drawback : - you will- note a low-volume , high-pitched static noise " a hiss , to be specific " inherent in every radio recording , regardless of band . While its not too offensive , nor enough to deter me from making direct radio recordings- ( at least of strong stations ) , there is still much room for improvement . - Obviously , - I can use the headphone jack and an external digital recorder to make better radio recordings . - But the convenience of an all-in-one recording device plus- radio outweighs the slight hiss in the internal recordings it produces . <p> All in all ? - I 'm reasonably pleased with the radio recording capabilities of the KA29 , and the improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lower the KA29s noise floor and fix the imaging problems , and add 1 kHz tuning increments , this could be a good value all-in-one radio , a real contender . <h> Summary <p> Ever radio has its pros and cons. - The following is a list I made while reviewing the KA29 : <p> Pros : <p> Keypad entry <p> Great audio for a tiny radio <p> FM reception quite good <p> MP3 playback audio is good <p> Onboard radio recording acceptable ( see con ) <p> 9/10 kHz select-able medium wave steps <p> Cons : <p> Sluggish response to most actions ; if ( for example ) volume control has been used , you must wait nearly 4 seconds before using another function <p> Awkward menu to navigate <p> No bandwidth selections <p> Imaging on SW bands <p> Fixed 5 kHz steps on shortwave <p> No adjustable bandwidth <p> Digital noise on portions of MW and SW bands <p> Low audio hiss present in all internal radio recordings ( see pro ) <p> No back stand <p> Antenna does not swivel 360 degrees for optimal placement <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make local radio recordings on-the-go , and the quality of your recordings is not a major concern , you might- give the KA29 a try ; chances are you 'll be fairly pleased with the affordable KA29 . <p> If you 're a shortwave radio hobbyist or DXer of any stripe , however , do n't  waste your time or money on the DE1129 . Instead , pitch in $10 more and buy a Tecsun PL-310ET " it has no MP3 recording or playback , but it will receive circles around the KA29. 42382 @qwx662382 <h> 28 thoughts on " A review of the Kaito KA29 / Degen DE29 " <p> Another excellent review . Your review was so inclusive of all the details about this radio , I decided to not even do a review of this radio on my YouTube channel as my review would be mundane compared to this review . On the other hand , I do plan to purchase one of these radios for demonstration of the radio in actual use . <p> Another thing I have notice recently with the newer shortwave portable radios hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just a repackage of an older design with some minor firmware changes . Example is the new lineup of Grundig radios under the Eton name . All four new radios appears to the old Grundig design with a new case and a few firmware changes . Kaito and Degen appears to be doing the same thing . Not that there is anything wrong with that concept . <p> I like the new security feature of the comments . I can almost get it right the first time every time . : 0 <p> Brilliant article , thank you ! It got me thinking : is it too much to ask of Santa to give us a Tecsun PL310 ET Mark II that would have an SSB capability onboard MP3 recording to an SD card ( Tecsun , I hope you 're reading this ! ) <p> I thought I would purchase the Digitech AR 1945 portable gen coverage receiver that Jaycar electronics stock.After reading a few disapointing reveiws , I thought I may aswell see for myself if the very poorly functioned SSB mode is true.Well upon buying it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through all its paces.AM/SW , FM and VHF AIR was excellent.The VHF AIR Band acturly scans.But yes the SSB section was indeed very poor.I tried everything I could think of to improve this.As I 'm a very serious SSB DXer , I 'm more interested in following Planes and Marine HF etc.For a start , I did not like the type of Antenna input socket at the back.It was the type you would connect a UHF TV antenna to.So I drilled out a large hole on the back of the case , big enough to take a Coaxal socket , the type that Ham radio gear use.I then fitted and soldered wires from the other antenna terminals to the socket.I have my 100 ft long line connected to it now via a coaxal plug and coaxal lead.Really good results , acturly far better than useing the supplied fitted antenna terminal.But one thing , since this has fully digital tuning , and a number of tuning steps to refine your tuning , you do need to be very paitent , and use the DX and Local settings switch.Its full of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be in a hurry to tune in a SSB station.If you know the correct frequency you want , take a little time and you will get very good results ! <p> 1 . Does the KA29 come with internal memory , or is it all written to a microSD card ? What is the maximum capacity microSD card it can take ? <p> 2 . How much space does a recording take ? For example , how much space would a 10 min recording take ? <p> Could I also record 5-6 hours ? How much space would that take ? <p> Is there any software you recommend that can extract a portion of an audio file ( that I 'd specify the time parameters ) ? <p> 3 . I currently have a Tecsun PL-600 . <p> Would you recommend I get another device ( such as the KA29 ) ? Or use some kind of Android audio recording app on my phone , and record playback while my Tecsun radio is playing ? Those apps might have some file size or time limitations . Or the audio quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record during the Ultra Portable Shortwave shootout ? <p> Ill try to answer what I can for youin truth , I 'm short on time to actually dig into the KA29 to answer all of these questions . = <p> Ill try to answer according to your question numbers : <p> 1 . Audio files , etc. are written to the Micro SD card . If memory serves ( me ! ) I do n't  think there is substantial built-in memory for anything other than basic radio functions ( perhaps to mark frequencies to memorysomething I do n't  typically do ) . <p> 2 . MicroSD cards are very inexpensive . You could probably store several weeks worth of recordings on one 32GB card . The files are compressed and do n't  take up much space . <p> I use Audacity to edit audio filesits free and there are several YouTube videos showing how to use it . <p> 3 . I use the Zoom H2N : http : //amzn.to/1f1qH2F I 'm sure there 's a way to use an Android device to record as long as you have a line-in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise in the recording , though . I 've never attempted this myself as I prefer stand-alone digital recorders like the Zoom series . <p> 4 . Check out my tutorial here : http : //swling.com/ Read through this and itll teach you how to find stations . <p> Note that were currently experiencing some wacky solar conditions which negatively impact shortwave listening conditionsespecially during the day . If you scroll down the right sidebar of my blog page , you 'll see a small graphic which describes todays current propagation conditions . <p> 5 . Perhaps someone else can chime in , but I know of no audio player/recorder that has both cassette and digital playback/recording capabilities in one . You can still find analog ( cassette ) recorders on eBay and musician sites , but most recorders sold today are digital . There are certainly no shortwave radios with built-in digital and analog ( cassette ) recording capabilities . I would simply use a basic digital recorder with a line-in jack for recording from a cassette or from the radio . You can use the headphone jack on your PL-600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record to a stand-alone digital recorder . <p> In general , the KA29 does an OK job recording from AM and shortwave . Its not a brilliant radio though , as my review states . <p> Ok , since I do n't  need another radio , a standalone digital recorder is a better idea . So instead of the KA29 , a digital recorder would give me more performance and features in terms of what I actually want to do , which is record audio . <p> I see there 's a Zoom H2n , and a Zoom H1 . But that the H2n allows for " pre-recording " . Does that mean I can set a schedule of when I want to record ( start/stop time ) ? If so , that is a very desirable feature . <p> You 're also suggesting I use the headphone jack of the PL-600 into the digital recorder . If I do that though , I wont be able to hear what 's being played / recorded , right ? I also want to be able to hear what 's recording . <p> Perhaps instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder to record ( without connecting it ) . <p> Hmm , is it possible for the recorder to record from the PL-600 , and for me to hear what 's being recorded , but for it to also NOT pickup background noise ? So if I 'm listening and recording from the radio , I would n't want it to pick up sounds of me walking around or typing in the background , haha . If I can avoid it . <p> Lastly , as for the cassette player , I guess since I only need it for playback , I will look for some analog cassette player . <p> I 've never used the " pre-record " function on the Zoom H2N , though it could come in handy . Its not a scheduling feature , though ; its used by people capturing live sound either via the line-in jack or microphone . here 's a quote from the owners manual : <p> " When pre-recording is on , this recorder can continuously capture two seconds of sound before recording is started manually . When is pressed , these two seconds are included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , for example , performances start suddenly . " <p> If you use a line-in connection from the PL-600 to the Zoom H2N , you can monitor the recording with headphones plugged into the H2N . If the PL-600 ( or any Tecsun for that matter ) had a proper line-out jack , you could even monitor the recording via the radios internal speaker . Unfortunately , few portables have a line-out ; one of the reasons I love my Sony ICF-SW7600GR . <p> If using a line-in connection , the Zoom H2N disconnects its microphone , so no ambient noises will be captured in the recording . <p> Regarding your question about the Tecsun PL-600 vs . PL-660 ? The PL-600 is a great radio , but I certainly use the PL-660 more often because it has better sensitivity and sync detection . My advice ? Use what you have now and invest in a stand alone recorder . Later , you can upgrade receivers . <p> Random question : Does your Sony ICF-SW7600GR allow you charge rechargeable batteries within the device , like my Tecsun ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you listen to the radio ? The Tecsun does n't  allow you to listen to the radio while its charging its batteries , which is a small inconvenience sometimes . I use rechargeable batteries in it . <p> Would you recommend the H2n or the H1 ? And why ? There 's a comparison chart near the bottom . <p> If the difference between the Zoom H1 and H2N is audio quality , given that the source is the Tecsun PL-600 radio , would I be able to tell the difference in audio quality ? Especially considering some of what I would record would be AM radio . <p> And if I got the Zoom H2N , would I use 2 channel audio mode ? The options are X/Y , Mid-Side , 2-channel surround and 4-channel surround . I do n't  think I 'd get surround sound , but just wondering if that 's what the best setting is for the job . <p> Is it also possible to use a digital recorder to enhance video recordings ? If I use a line out on my digital camera ( I have to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my phone , while recording video , and feed it to the Zoom , then it would it would use the Zooms audio recording in the video file , right ? I 'm trying to think of a few different ways I could use a digital recorder . To make sure this is something I could apply a few different ways , from time to time . And not just have it be a limited use device . <p> I think you would only need the H1 for line-in recordings from the PL-600 . The only reason I upgraded from an H1 to an H2N is because I actually record live interviews from time-to-time . The audio quality ( between the H2N and H1 ) is similar on line-in recordings if not the same . <p> With the H2N , by the way , you ca n't use 2 and 4 channel surround on line in recordings . <p> But if I were to take this to a concert ( seems portable enough to fit in a pocket , WITH a camera in the same pocket ) , then 96 kHz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert , I 'd probably do 2-3 songs at most . I 'd spend the rest of the time , simply enjoying the performance , or taking pics . I do n't  want to get too distracted and record a whole show . <p> Would I use MS mode , or XY mode ( if I get the H2n ) ? Or would that depend on my placement ? If I 'm center , I use one mode . If I 'm on the side , I use another ? <p> After listening to some samples on YouTube , I think its ok . But I do n't  think its so great that I 'd appreciate the details of the audio quality when listening to it later . Right now , it seems more like an improvement over camera or phone mics to capture audio , but I 'm not sure the 96 kHz WAV would bring the details that I 'd expect from a lossless format . I do n't  know if I 'd get it and think wow , the quality of the recording is great . <p> Maybe I just have n't listened to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I listened to some of the same YouTube clips for live music , this time with good headphones . <p> Some of them sounded much better , and I 'd be happy with the recording quality . <p> I did think that when noisier bands were recorded , or bands with many instruments , that the vocals were usually a little buried for my tastes . The vocals werent quiet , but they werent loud either . But , there can be different factors for that , such as where the H2N was placed ; and the conditions of the environment ; etc . <p> I 've recorded an interview on my Zoom H2N that was used in a professional radio production . They 're quite amazing devicesespecially for the price . <p> Honestly , recording line-in audio from an AM signal is a fairly lo-fi process . I usually record in . WAV mono , but then convert to MP3 for distribution . I typically make the conversion to a 128kbps MP3 . Frankly , that 's probably overkill for an AM off air recording , because the audio bandwidth is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning on using the H2N for anything live ( like a concert ) , I would invest in this package : http : //amzn.to/1TFaTAj <p> I purchased this package ; the grip and windscreen are a must . The case works very well , too . <p> I was n't sure whether there was an option for mono , because I did n't  come across it in any of the reviews or YouTube reviews I researched . But now that you said its possible , I will use this . <p> When reading about the Tascam DR-40 , some reviews explicitly mentioned mono as an option . <p> So , when recording from AM radio with the H2n , I will use mono , now that I know its possible . <p> For live recordings , would MS mode @ 96 kHz be the best ? 4-channel or 2-channel ? Does it depend on where Im positioned ? Would MS mode still be ok if I was off to the side ? I usually am on the floor , so I go where I have the best view . Sometimes that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , I came across the accessory package . I thought I 'd get it at some point , just did n't  want to get it at this moment , as the H2n + 32GB memory card + 3.5 mm audio cable were enough of a purchase at this moment . <p> I agree the windscreen in that package is a must . But the package seemed to be missing a hot shoe ? I want to be able to mount the H2N to my camera , just above it . My camera currently does not have a hot shoe mount , but I have a good idea of what I want for my next camera , and I also confirmed yesterday that the model Ive been looking at has a hot shoe slot . <p> This past week has been quite a bit of learning for me . As I never thought about digital recorders before . Nor did I know what a windscreen , nor hot shoe were . But after seeing how people use them , and seeing how I could do some of the same things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would use the digital recorder at a concert in my hand only , and for 1-3 songs at most . I do n't  want to divert my attention too much . But in the future , I 'd mount it to a camera ( and not have it in my hand ) . <p> I actually record everything in stereo , but change it to mono via Audacity . I do n't  think it can record mono natively , but perhaps I 'm wrong . <p> In terms of how to record a concert it completely depends . I 've recorded in stereo and four channel depending on the position of the mic relative to the band . I always monitor with headphones and pick out the pattern I like best . <p> If you 're using the Zoom digital recorder to make the recording , make sure your recording level is high enough . It may be that your recording level was low , but the recorder monitoring volume was high as you made the recording . This would result in lower audio levels upon export . <p> Make sure your audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without clipping the audio . You might check for a tutorial online . <p> I 'm sure you could increase the audio level via Audacity . Its always best to have the level correct in the beginning , though . <p> Keep tinkering with the mic gain and your headphone levels and you 'll soon sort it out ! <p> Sorry about not getting back to youIm notoriously bad about forgetting to reply to comments especially while I 'm traveling . <p> I recorded at least two live concerts in a medium size venue for my buddy , BJ Leiderman . BJ took my recording and used it to mix with the recording coming off the boardmixed , it sounded like a proper live concert . <p> I simply put the H2N on a boom type holder above the audience at the back of the venue with the sound guy . I ran it in 4 channel . <p> You will have to experiment . Some venues lens themselves well to recording , others not so much . You should monitor the recording the whole time and make adjustments when necessary . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . yes it is not for continous coverage and jumps in 5kHz . My radio came with the user manual and at this point i want to talk about a correction in this review . the antenna can be turn around front and back , to the front limited by the plastic case position , but to back , you can swivel from vertical to minus 15 degrees and rotate around . considering the desing was made for broadcasting reception i think it is a good , very portable and incredible audio for this size , radio . the cons , some noise and the slow processor . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384 
@@75207523 @3907523/ <h> Listening to WWV at the source : Fort Collins , Colorado , USA <p> If you have n't already guessed it : yes , - the mystery broadcast site I posted on Thursday was WWV/WWVB in Fort Collins , Colorado . Well done , responders ! - Specifically , the photo shows the southern antennas of WWVB as I departed- the site on Thursday , August 28 , 2014 ; for those of you who got that detail , - extra credit " ! <p> I 'd like to thank- the staff at WWV/WWVB for allowing me to visit the site for the better part of- the day . WWV is- not officially open to tours , so this was a particular honor for me . And this- was an especially fun pilgrimage , as WWV was most likely the first shortwave broadcast I ever heard : - as I 've previously noted , when I was a kid- my father used to set his watch to WWV every Sunday morning . - Now I 've seen firsthand- where that- famous tock , tock ( and accompanying characteristic tones ) originate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sort through the photos I took at WWV and WWVB , and- post them here on the SWLing Post . <h> Recording WWV <p> In the meantime , I have a few recordings to share with those who are interested in this mecca of chronology . - Before leaving WWV , I pulled out my Tecsun PL-380 and my Zoom H2N digital recorder , and recorded all- the WWV broadcast frequencies . I captured their 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and even their recently reactivated 25 MHz signals . <p> I made these recordings in the conference- room at WWVB broadcast house . As you can imagine , it was simply not at all necessary to extend the telescopic antenna . In fact , the signal was so strong , you 'll hear a slight amount of distortion in the voice audio . <p> Below , you can listen to the recordings of each frequency via the embedded player ( click on the title to download the audio ) . Enjoy ! <p> Up to this point , I used the Tecsun PL-380 , but quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick look at the back of the radio revealed that the 380 only tunes up to 21.950 MHz ( ! ) . Believe it or not , I 'd never noticed this limitation of the PL-380 , likely since I rarely tune above 21 MHz for broadcast listening . - Learn something new every dayBut I could n't fail to complete my recordings . <p> So what did I do ? I turned to Matthew Deutch , Chief Engineer at WWV and WWVB , who kindly allowed me to use their Sangean ATS-505 to make the final recording : <p> What a " coincidence " . Hopefully , before the summer holidays officially end , I will be off to another shortwave transmitter site . Well , to the remains of it . I will be visiting the former RFE/RL ( and VOA in the last years of operation ) site in Playa de Pals , near the Catalan city of Girona and also very close to my main QTH in Barcelona . The Pals RFE/RL site was from where a 1MW signal was transmitted by feeding the same audio signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in phase , then the big Group D dipole curtain was divided into two " halves " by switching the feed lines in the appropriate way . Each half of the curtain received 500KW from two transmitters . So the total was 1000KW , or 1MW . If we add the antenna gain , the ERP was in the order of several megawatts . This was a signal directed to Eastern Europe , and more specifically to Moscow , via single-hop propagation . I suppose receivers in Moscow released plenty of smoke and had to be replaced every time they were tuned to a RFE/RL signal from Pals . Hahaha ! <p> The curtains were demolished in 2006 and because the place is abandoned now and has been repeatedly sacked , the station buildings are in a very poor situation , specially in the inside . Almost no radio hardware survives , but what is still there is quite interesting . For example , I am interested in one of the parabolic dishes ( 6.5m in diameter ) that was used to receive the audio feeds via satellite ( Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortwave frequencies ) . I wonder whether that dish could be used for ham radio microwave experimentation purposes . Here in Spain and more specifically in Catalonia the GHz bands are seeing every day more ham activity , so my idea could be good . <p> There is an excellent website ( www.radioliberty.org ) which is a virtual museum of all things related to the Pals station . It was created and is maintained by a former worker of the station . The language in the English version of the website is a bit " macaronic " in some parts of the site , but I think this is a minor issue given the excellent amount of information kept there . <p> Finally , although not part of the Pals station virtual museum website , there was even a documentary made , after the demolition of the antennas , as a tribute to the station . It can be watched in the following link although parts of it have not been translated to English : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=tJnxsSL3bbY <p> I will be taking some receivers ( and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go there .

Performance-wise , you 'll find that this radio is on par with the Eton E5/Grundig G3 and is usually slightly more affordable . It gets consistently good reviews from users and guides . One of its outstanding features is its synchronous selectable sideband , a feature which helps to reduce fading distortion and adjacent-channel interference . This feature alone gives the Sony ICF-SW7600GR the ability to hold its own with radios in a higher price bracket . Another plus is that the Sony will allow you to select between upper and lower sidebands . This makes tuning in ham radio , utility and other SSB signals a breeze . The only thing lacking on this wonderful portable is a tuning knob , something I personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its specs : <p> If you 're not as concerned about portability , the C.Crane CCRadio-SW is an excellent value for performance . Think of the CCRadio-SW as a larger portable/table top radio ( 11.25 " x 7.25 " x 3.5 " ) . What makes this radio stand out from its peers ? Truly exceptional audio fidelity . The large built-in speaker has separate treble and bass controls and reminds me how important audio quality is while listening to a faint signal . This radio 's audio will fill a large room . Shortwave sensitivity is very good . If you like to do Medium Wave ( or AM broadcast band ) Dxing , you 're in for a treat . The CCRadio-SW has the best AM reception of any radio I 've ever tested under $300 . FM reception is equally amazing . Negatives ? Well , besides being a larger portable--not ideal for stashing in your carry-on--the CCRadio-SW does not have direct keying to enter frequencies . Also , it does not have Single Sideband built in . However , it does have impressive array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with an IF converter and some free software ) will allow you to interpret SSB and an array of digital signals including DRM ( Digital Radio Mondial ) . What really strikes me about the CCRadio-SW is its sheer ease of use--it 's design is simple , ergonomic and effective . Here are some specs : <p> Unfortunately , the E1 is no longer manufactured by Eton , but they are still widely avaialble in the used market--check Universal Radio 's used list or eBay ( below ) . With that said , the Eton E1 is , by far , the best performer in the portable selection on this page . It offers a professional quality receiver that will impress the experienced shortwave listener and outperform pricier tabletop models . I really think of this rig as a tabletop shortwave radio that 's designed to be portable . The only negatives I 've heard about the E1 were some initial quality problems with the LCD display and the eventual " sticky " feeling of the rubberized body ( click here for remedies ) . Here is a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget is tight , or if you 're looking for a radio that could easily slip into your glove compartment , backpack , or even jacket pocket , you need to look at an ultra-portable shortwave radio . Typically , there is a performance compromise with ultra-portable radios , in that : they usually do n't have the ability to receive weaker signals like their more expensive cousins ; they have a more limited frequency range ; and they do n't detect single-sideband signals . Still , the ones listed here are good performers for their size and price . <p> Tecsun PL-310 <p> The Tecsun PL-310 has become a mini legend in the world of portable radio as it offers exceptional value and high-performance in a small package . What makes it so special ? A DSP ( Digital Signal Processing ) chip that gives this ultra-portable excellent sensitivity and selectivity . A favorite amongst ultra-light Dxers , the PL-310 has exceptional overall performance on the shortwave , mediumwave and FM bands--especially for the price . The price ? That 's the other thing that makes this radio so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is primarily available through eBay sellers in Hong Kong , so it may take up to 2 weeks to receive your new radio , but it 's well worth the wait . Please see link below to search eBay for a Tecsun PL-310 . <p> The Tecsun PL-380 is my favorite radio under $60 . Much like its cousin , the PL-310 ( above ) , the PL-380 has a DSP ( Digital Signal Processing ) chip that gives this ultra-portable excellent sensitivity and selectivity . Indeed , the DSP bandwidth can be adjusted to 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 kHz . The PL-380 is even marginally better at weak signal DXing than the PL-310 . The PL-380 is my favorite radio for travelling--I even wrote a post about this on our blog . You can also click here to listen to an audio clip of it being compared to two lesser radios . Take note , however , that like the PL-310 , the PL-380 does not have a single-side band mode . In short , the Tecsun PL-380 is a superb value and excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KA1102 , below ) pack the most " bang for your buck " if you 're looking for an inexpensive , ultra-portable entry into SWLing . The KA1103 is full featured and a great performer . I 'm also impressed with the audio quality that comes out of this radio 's relatively small speaker . One interesting design feature of the KA1103 is the large Digital/Analog frequency display . The LCD screen features the frequency display in digits ( like all of the portables I recommend ) , but also sports a working digital representation of an analog frequency dial . As you tune up and down the band--with , yes , a tuning knob--the LCD needle moves along the display like an analog radio dial would . I suppose this could be a useful feature for people who like to see where they are on the band as they scan . I know of no other portable radio that has this quirky feature . The KA1103 gets a lot of good reviews for its ability to receive weak FM signals . My only gripes with the KA1103 and Kaito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomics could be better . 2 . ) You really need to read the manual before understanding all of the radio functions--I wish Kaito 's were slightly more intuitive . 3 . ) Quality control varies with Kaito ( more so than with Grundig/Et+n and Sony ) --make sure you buy from an authorized dealer and that you save your reciept . Still , for the money , with the KA1103 you 're getting a receiver that is almost as good as the Sony and Eton E5 above . Features include : <p> What caught my attention before purchasing the Kaito KA1102 ( a.k.a . Degen DE1102 ) were the numerous positive customer reviews on the internet . The KA1102 radio is small , but feature-packed . This radio actually has the ability to receive single-sideband ( SSB ) --one of the only radios in its price-class which can . Many shortwave radio listeners and radio amateurs consider the KA1102 to be an ideal backpacking rig because of SSB capability . Quality control with Kaito and Degen radios is hit-and-miss . I had to return my KA1102 twice before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , I strongly suggest you purchase the Kaito brand ( not Degen ) from an authorized dealer as it carries a warranty and can be returned/replaced . Degen products , in general , do not carry a warranty in N. America . Even minding some QC issues , I still believe the KA1102 is a solid performer and worth some minor hassel . Other features include : <p> I was skeptical when I first held the CCRadio-SWP in my hand . I mean , this is a tiny shortwave radio--how could it possibly perform ? I was pleasantly surprised , however , once I turned it on . First of all--as with most C.Crane products--the layout and design are very simple , the display clear , with easily read icons and intuitive controls . The tuning knob on the right side is for fine tuning--no muting or chugging between frequencies , either . Shortwave and MW sensitivity are better than one might expect for a radio this size ; I find myself comparing it to much pricier portables . Admittedly , this is a small radio , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a tinny sound , the tuning knob is small , there is no single-sideband reception , nor does it have an external antenna jack . This is also one of the few radios I list that does n't have a battery recharge feature . But ( and this is a great " but " ) it also has the longest battery life of any radio I own : almost 70 hours on 2 AA cells ! This is a great portable , and you 're going to find that you take it with you everywhere . I certainly do . Here are some specs : <p> Like its bigger brother ( the Kaito KA1102 , above ) , this ultra-portable packs a lot of features and performance into a small package . It is quite sensitive on the shortwave bands , and , as a bonus , user reviews consistently tout this radio 's ability to pick up weak FM stations . One odd thing about this radio is that it displays frequencies in MHz format rather than kHz . And being very compact , its speaker does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the larger radios do n't fit so nicely in a car 's glove compartment , either . Please note that the KA1101 does not receive single-sideband . Here 's a list of its features : <h> Desktop Radios <p> Alinco DX-R8T <p> The Alinco DX-R8T is a fine receiver tabletop receiver and our recommendation as a first tabletop receiver . Why ? It 's simple to operate , yet it has all of the major features I like in a tabletop radio : it 's well-built , easy to use , sensitive , versatile , and it has sufficient control options to help adjust adjacent interference and improve intelligibility . It also has a very attractive price at $499 US . It 's next-best competitor is probably the Icom R75--but neither the Icom , nor the Palstar R30A , can be used as a Software Defined Radio and neither have the appropriate IF output for Digital Radio Mondial ( DRM ) as does the Alinco DX-R8T . In short , it 's a lot of radio for the money , excellent for those starting in the hobby . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds , a simple " turn on and tune in " tabletop , plus a fully DRM ready SDR.Read our in-depth review of the Alinco DX-R8T by clicking here . Here 's a list of its features : <p> The CommRadio CR-1 is the newest portable/desktop radio on the market . The CR-1 was introduced in January 2013 . The CR-1 is a sturdy radio built with longevity and performance in mind . It 's the little touches I love : a near-perfect anodized aluminum tuning knob , size &amp; portability , multiple antenna jacks , an excellent internal battery and gold-plated circuit board pads . Performance-wise , the CR-1 has great sensitivity and selectivity on the HF bands . <h> Software Defined Radios <p> SDRplay RSP <p> The SDRplay RSP is one of the recent generation of economical wideband SDRs based upon innovative , inexpensive chipsets ; in the RSP 's case , based upon the Mirics MSI3101 SDR chip , and a MSI001 tuner . Priced at a mere $149 US ( plus shipping ) , the SDRplay RSP is one of the least expensive , yet full-featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which require no extra upconverter . The SDRplay team continuously tweak and update the drivers which help the RSP interface with third party SDR applications . We believe the SDRplay RSP represents one of the best receiver values on this page ; for $149 US , you will have a wide coverage receiver capable of rivaling radios in a much higher price category . <p> Of course , the SDR Play RSP is a software defined radio , so to unlock its potential , it must be paired with a capable PC , laptop or tablet device .

They sell two noteworthy shortwave radios , the CCRadio-SW and the CCRadio-SWP ( both reviewed here ) . <p> Ten-Tec is celebrating their 40th anniversary this year . This excellent company manufactures their radios in Sevierville , TN . Yes , their radios are truly made in the USA . Ten-Tec only offers a handful of shortwave receivers ; several kits and two factory-built receivers ( the RX-320D--possibly the best receiver performance on the market for $370 US--and the legendary professional-grade RX-340 ) .

@@75207532 @3907532/ <h> Results of the Shortwave Portable weak signal shoot-out <p> Thanks to all who participated in our shoot-out ! - Last week , I posted three recordings- of a weak shortwave broadcast in an attempt to evaluate which recording " thus which radio " our- listeners prefer . The test was " blind " in that , though four radios were evaluated , - only three recordings were posted , merely labeled , " Sample #1 , " " Sample #2 , " and " Sample #3 , " respectively . <p> The radios tested were not just average radios . Rather , they represent the best of the- truly portable radios currently on the market , namely : the Sangean ATS-909X , the Tecsun PL-880 , the Tecsun-PL660 and the Sony ICF-SW7600GR . <p> Indeed , the most popular question I receive from SWLing Post readers is about two or more of these models , asking , " which- is best ? " <h> The samples <p> To refresh your memory , I 've embedded the audio samples below " but if you have n't yet , I would encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader comments following ! ) - before proceeding . <p> The recordings in our samples- are- of- Radio Romania International- on 11,975 kHz . Normally , the signal would have been stronger , but propagation was rough , and QSB ( fading ) was pronounced at times . Note that I recorded all of these samples with my Zoom H2N digital recorder via a line-in connection , - using the radios headphone jack . Since not all of the radios have a line-out jack , I used the headphone jack each time and simply set the volume and line-in gain to the same level . <p> And now , here is the sample I intentionally left out in my previous postSample #4 . I did n't  include it in the evaluation because , frankly , it was such a weak performer compared with the other three ; I knew it would take last place : <h> Sangean ATS-909X ( $200-250 US ) <p> Many readers guessed rightly that the Sangean ATS-909X was the radio omitted . Evidently , it is known for its lack of sensitivity when only employing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , the RRI broadcast is lost in the static . <p> Frankly , I was somewhat surprised that the ATS-909X did n't  perform better . It has a loyal following amongst SWLing Post readers- and has been a popular radio on the market for the past three years or so . While I 've used the ATS-909X in the past , I have never owned one , and had never done a side-by-side comparison . <p> To perform this test , I borrowed the 909X from a friend who usually has it hooked up to an external antenna . In fact , this is when I learned that- the 909X performs admirably when hooked up to an external antenna . <p> In my tests , however , I did n't  want to hook up external antennas. - I believe that for a radio to be evaluated as a portable , it must be- judged on its ability to receive signals from its telescopic whip antenna as a base line . <p> But let 's move on to the radios you did hear in our weak signal evaluation <p> Let 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio our readers- voted to take last place in terms of weak-signal listening : <h> Tecsun PL-880 : Sample 3 ( $150-160 US ) <p> With the exception of three votes ( out of more than seventy ) , Sample #3the Tecsun PL-880was overwhelmingly voted worst in this weak-signal shoot-out . <p> The bulk of your criticisms- focused on the fact that the PL-880 did not handle fading as well as the other radios . When the signal was at a peak , it sounded great , but in QSB troughs , the signal became unintelligible and you could hear DSP artifacts and distortion . <p> But is the PL-880 a " bad " radio ? Absolutely not . Indeed , I gave it pretty high marks when I reviewed it last year . Its just not the best- choice- for weak-signal listening " at least in- its current firmware version . - Note to Tecsun : - I do believe it may be possible to tweak this portables AGC circuit so that it handles fading better <h> Tecsun PL-660 : Sample 2 ( $110-130 US ) <p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noticeable lead on the other radios . I 'm not surprised . The sensitivity was better than the rest of the contestants , in my opinion . The received audio was clear and seemed to pop out of the static better than the others . <p> Overwhelmingly , those who did n't  vote the PL-660 as best , voted it as second . Their main criticism was that the PL-660s AGC was a little too active and less stable than the radio which actually took first place . <p> And with no further ado , - heres- our winner : <h> Sony ICF-SW7600GR : Sample 1 ( $130-150 US ) <p> Surprised ? - I was ! <p> After I evaluated the blind test myself , I was certain the PL-660 would be the winner with its stronger sensitivity . But the result " and reader comments " proved me wrong . More of you placed a value on the Sonys rock-solid AGC circuit which handles the peaks and troughs of fading better than the other contenders . <p> Commenters noted that the Sonys audio and stability lent itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , that many of these same commenters mentioned that the PL-660 ( Sample #2 ) would be their preference for identifying a station in under weak signal conditions . <p> Now let 's look at the raw data , and then discuss what it all means . <h> The- data <p> The Sony ICF-SW7600GR- was voted : <p> first- place 41 times , <p> second- place 2o times , and <p> third- place once <p> The Tecsun PL-660- was voted : <p> first- place 23 times , <p> second- place 33 times , and <p> third place twice <p> The Tecsun PL-880- was voted : <p> first- place never , <p> second- place three times , and <p> third place 53 times <p> Ive attempted to place this data into a bar graph to make it a little easier to visualize : - If you noticed that these numbers do n't  completely add up , its because responses were inconsistent . <p> Most survey participants- listed their preferences in order ( i.e. , first , second , and third- place ) . Some respondents only listed their favorite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  like . No one responded with a tie between the radios , all had an opinion . <p> " Although a majority of people- choose sample #1 , nearly everyone ranked either sample #1 or sample #2- as preferred , and the average ranks are very close , closer than the- raw percentages would indicate . I have not done a statistical analysis- so I do n't  know if the difference in mean rank between #1 and #2 is- significant ( in other words , I do n't  know if there is a significant- preference for #1 ) , but you can say that either sample 1 or sample 2- would be acceptable to almost everyone , and sample 3 clearly last- choice . " <p> Radio Flynn also pointed out that next time I do this sort of test ( and I will be doing another ! ) that I should keep votes consistent by asking everyone- to rank their preference. - Excellent suggestion ; I 'll be sure to do so . <p> So the Sony ICF-SW7600GR is the best radioright ? <p> Not exactly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio for any particular listener . <p> This test only evaluated weak signal sensitivity under rather rough conditions. - The Sony was " the winner " in this respect . <p> But this does n't  tell the whole story . <p> I 've had my Sony 7600GR longer than any of the other portables in this contest and it is invariably the radio I reach for when- I want to make a field recording . I prefer the Sony because it has good sensitivity , a stable AGC , excellent single-sideband selectable sync detection and it can handle being connected to a long external antenna . Indeed , it was the Sony I packed when I spent the summer of 2012 in an off-grid cabin in the Canadian maritimes . In short : my Sony ICF-SW7600GR is my " old faithful . " <p> But frankly , when I travel , I reach for the PL-660 more often than not . Why ? - Yes , the Sony has great receiver characteristics , but its ergonomics leave a lot to be desired . I use my Sony when I plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PL-660 is a joy to operate , has simple direct-frequency entry , an excellent auto-tune feature , not to mention , - a stable- sync detector . <p> If I want to identify a signal buried in the static , I reach for the PL-660 . <p> If I want to do casual listening and am less concerned with DXing , I reach for the PL-880 . Its a solid radio and has a quality feel to it- ( running neck-and-neck with the ATS-909X in this respect ) . - Of this bunch , it has by far , the best audio from its internal speaker . If I want armchair listening , I reach for the PL-880 . Its also an excellent SSB receiver " one of the best in this group " and offers- more filter selections . <p> In summary , its not always easy to suggest which radio is bestI must ask in response , " Best for what ? " The data from this test proves this , - as our readers- who ranked their favorites backed up their choices with consistent and valid comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I plan to pit these radios ( and perhaps another ? ) against each other in terms of their synchronous detectors in another blind test . - It may take a while to work this up . Your enthusiastic responses , however , completely justify it . 42382 @qwx662382 <p> Well done Thomas . I have enjoyed your post and the dialogue of the readers . Finally , the lack of a tuning knob , makes Sony last choice when somebody likes to search for a signal . You are right . I find it quite good when I have the exact frequency in mind . Also it is its weak audio issue as well . Any way , I will order a PL-660 . <p> Thomas Excellent experiment ! This was a lot of fun and I appreciate you taking the time to perform the test . I kept checking my email to see when the results would come in . <p> I think the synch test is a great idea . Please put a Sony ICF-2010 in that test as a standard point of reference . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed opinion that the 2010 is " one of the best " . It may also give us a good idea of how effective modern technology really is . <p> One other test I would suggest : compare the radios for fidelity ( how good does it sound ) when listening to a moderate to strong popular shortwave broadcast . I suspect many of your subscribers gravitate to such programs . Each radio would be adjusted to make it sound its best using all the features provided rather than making all settings equal between radios . That would include using an outside antenna or whip , whichever the radio performs best with . <p> Ken , Excellent suggestions and I will plan to put the 2010 in the sync shoot out . Ill also include a few other radios that might not currently be on the market , but are widely available . Cheers , Thomas <p> I echo Christos and Ken Carrs earlier comments great idea Thomas . Ive been waiting in anticipation all week for the results ! <p> I own two of the radios in the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially relevant to me . I was pleased that the 660 came second , but got caught out by the 4th placing of the 909X perhaps I just did n't  want to admit what I perhaps already knew deep down ? <p> I already owned the 909X when I bought the PL660 , and it did n't  take long for my A/B comparisons with both , on the first day of owning the Tecsun , to make me realise the superiority of the latter for pulling in weak stations . I still use the 909X of course , but more for casual listening ( as you do with the Tecsun 880 ) , but its the PL660 I reach for when I want performance . <p> I havent had a Sony shortwave receiver since the late 90s , but this test proves the sound design behind the 7600 . <p> Looking forward to more of these tests as they come up thanks for taking the trouble Thomas ! <p> Thank you Thomas for this interesting test . I was suspecting that the Sangean was the one omitted , ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , radio out of the box should preform well with its antenna without the need to mess with it . as I noted , i have messed with my 909 to get it going , as it was totaly deaf with its telescopic antenna ( but exellent with external antenna ) , and now it preforms well with the telescopic antenna . as for me , I would be interested comparing the 909X preformance in SSB mode ( the capability of zero in on a signal , and how it will sound on different radios ) . another thing is ergonomics , as you noted , the 7600GR lacks the tuning knob , and for me it is A serious con . Well done , and all the best ! Moshe Z. <p> Thomas , your idea of making a recording and letting your readers decide the winner is brilliant in its simplicity and objectivity . Every other radio review I can think of is either entirely or mostly subjective opinion , but you have found a way to eliminate biases and surprise us with the result . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I found the radios to be fairly consistent across the bands . With that said , sensitivity on each radio does vary slightly going from the lower bands to the higher ones . I found , for example , that the 909X did a little better job on the lower bands at night ( though still not on par with the others when only using the whip antenna ) . -Thomas <p> Great shootout . Thanks ! Thoughts : Adding a 2010 and G3 to the mix sounds great . This last test was a " line out to recorder " test . It will be tougher It is tougher to demonstrate how the radio speakers sound a decent recording microphone and attention to placement will affect how each radios speaker is perceived in a recording . Just the same , this test could satisfy curiosity about DXing using the radios speaker as opposed to ear buds . Also curious if you would consider re-doing this last test and narrowing the 880 bandwidth to match that of the 660 &amp; Sony ? How does matching bandwidths affect perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more high frequency hash enters the audio spectrum so the 880 sounds weaker . But is it ? Thanks again , Mark <p> Good points , Mark . I might just post some recordings sometime of the PL-880 as the bandwidth decreases . It has so many BW increments , its hardly fair to the bulk of the contenders who only have two . = Thanks for your comments ! -Thomas <p> Another suggestion for a shootout or two : I 'd also like to hear one that puts fringe daytime mediumwave ( and maybe also longwave ) signals up against each other , as well as being able to maintain relatively good audio fidelity ( +/-2 kHz at -3 dB would be abysmal , 5 kHz would be ok , 9.95 kHz would be amazing Im guessing ) on a fringe mediumwave station sandwiched between two stronger signals +/- 10 kHz on either side , at least one of which is an ultra-strong local , with no splatter at all . <p> For example , I 'm thinking the test station on the sensitivity test would be indicating 15 dB- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode ( or if the dB- can read lower , than no more than 1 or 2 dB above the lowest it will register ) . The signal should be strong enough to be able to recognize the tune of a piece of music that may be playing , but too weak to be able to understand speech even if its in English . I 'd also like to hear radios with other-sized antennas tested , so I can have an idea of how much difference there is between them for example anything from a small antenna like an SRF-59 to a large antenna like a CCRadio / PR-D5 / etc , and smaller and larger . <p> For selectivity , take a similarly-weak station to the sensitivity test , next to a very strong local station whose dB- on the PL-880 is up in the mid to upper 90s . ( The station on the other side of the weak target should , if possible , be the higher of 52 dB- , or 48 dB- stronger than the target . ) <p> I plan to do a MW shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( greyline ) and night conditions . In many ways MW is so much more complicated to set-up for a review , but its such a great way to evaluate performance and , especially , AGC characteristics . <p> Further to my earlier comments about the Sangean 909X and the Tecsun PL660 , I largely use the internal antennas on both radios ( which is usually more convenient for me ) . However , I tried both of them on their external antennas again today . Its certainly true that the 909Xs sensitivity does improve on the external antenna and , interestingly , I noticed on the PL660 that some stronger stations tended to overload the radio with the external antenna connected not that its needed in those cases though . <p> One area in which I feel the Sangean really scores though is the layout of station memory " pages " , and its reception on FM/AM/LW . And its quite a good looking piece of kit too ! What I guess it underlines is that its a good idea to have more than one shortwave radio , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully have all bases covered ! <p> Wow ! That is a surprise . I was about to replace my 7600GR with a PL-880 so I could gain a tuning knob , that awesome DSP selectivity , great audio , and keep SSB . Guess I 'll wait and see what Tecsun does with it . <p> Fortunately , I still have my Panasonic RF-2200 that I bought back in the late 70s . Great audio , excellent performance , and a nice big tuning knob = A little too bulky for travelling and way too drifty for good SSB performance though . <p> Trust me , I had serious fun reading your excellent comments and watching the results roll in on the shoot out . I will certainly be doing this again soon . Frankly , as Radio Flynn stated , its a great way to actually crowd source a review and test a radio prior to owning it . The sound you heard when playing those recordings is the same sound I heard while testing them . <p> Tomorrow , I plan to put together a fun challenge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I hope all of you will join in the fun . <p> I do not have the PL-660 , but both my PL-600 and R9700DX TECSUN radios have an annoying hiss when there is silence between words or passages of music . Does the PL-660 have that as well ? The audio from my ICF-SW7600GR is thin sounding but almost all noise is filtered out so speech is very understandable . I see there is a SONY ICF-SW7600GX shown on the SONY US website and by Google I see that model number listed in Eastern Europe . <p> Hi , David , I have a G3 here , but did n't  include it for two reasons : 1 . ) Its no longer in production I tried to stick with radios currently on the market and 2. ) the very final batches of G3s that were sold had some technical issues . With that said , I am very tempted to pit the G3 against the PL-660 at some point . For a few years , the most popular question I received was , " which is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stay tuned ! <p> Interesting , my Sony ICF SW7600GR unit is inferior to my Tecsun Pl-880 ( Firmware Version 8820 ) in terms of weak signal sensitivity , could this be a result of product variation ? I would n't be surprised considering the universal lack in quality control in the Chinese electronics market . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

Sounds fun and intriguing . - Perhaps you can help solve this mystery <p> Boards of Canada ( Source : Last.fm ) <p> Hello , readers of The SWLing Post , and please forgive the intrusion . I admittedly know very little about shortwave radio , but there has been a bit of a puzzle going on for fans of the band " Boards of Canada " recently , and there is the distinct possibility that its solution could involve shortwave radio . A message I posted over on Reddit was forwarded to Thomas , who very graciously offered to post the plea here . <p> Some background Boards of Canada is an instrumental electronic music duo from Scotland who are , to put it mildly , somewhat private and aloof , in all the right ways . Their references tend to be very math-heavy and their music has some innovative and fascinating-sounding tape loops , synths , etc . This puzzle has been going on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very impressed with the complexity of it , though we are not even certain of the meaning of it though we hope and suspect it is a lead-up to a new release by the band . <p> Someone ( presumably the band ) has been currently leaving these ( for lack of a better word ) " clues " in several key places in the media . First , a single album was sold to one person on National Record Store Day in the US an album containing a " numbers station " style reading of a series of 6 numbers . Then a cryptic YouTube video with another series of 6 numbers also being read like a voice on a numbers station . 6 additional numbers were played ( unannounced and without explanation ) over a commercial radio station in England . Then on April 25 , the band stealthily released 6 more numbers by encoding a link hidden in a gif a link to two soundfiles that had to be played simultaneously in order to cancel out the phase and reveal you guessed it another numbers station-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 1 or 2 more series of numbers out there and given the nature of the broadcasts , plus the picture of a radio tower on the bands Facebook page and the different media by which the band has released some clues , there is at least some reason to believe that perhaps there is another series of numbers being broadcast somehow over shortwave radio . <p> Here is where I 'm hoping the expertise of your readership might come in as I say , I apologetically have no idea how the world of shortwave radio works . But I 'm wondering : in your journeys across the frequencies recently , have any of you stumbled across anything that sounds like this : <p> http : //youtu.be/Qe4UCjjyr8U specifically something with that same chime pattern at the beginning and then the 6 numbers ? ( This is obviously not a " real " numbers station broadcast , but something made to sound like it ) .

@@75207543 @3907543/ <h> Mikes solution for sticky radios <p> Many shortwave radios , such as those manufactured by Grundig/Eton , have been produced with a rubberized coating that makes the radio easier to hold in the hand . I like this coating because it gives me a sure grip on the radio . <p> However , over time ( say , two to three years ) the coating can break down and begin to produce a sticky residue . All of a sudden your " grippy " coating feels more like tacky painteven leaving a bit of residue on anything it touches . <p> Many models have this coating : The Grudig G5 and G3 , The Eton E1 , E1-XM , FR350 , FR400 , FR500 and FR600 , to name a few . <p> Michael Kitchen ( KD5PXH ) recently wrote with his solution for sticky radios : <p> After experementing with cotton balls/pads , and using window cleaner and other liquid agents , I managed to decently remove the gummy coating from an Eton FR-400 . <p> Best to use 91% Isopropyl Alcohol , and a clean but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The stronger percentage alcohol makes for easier breaking down of the sticky , and the wash cloth to remove , without damaging the surface or removing lettering . The trick is to always use clean spot on wash cloth , keep from just smearing the stickyness around . The wash cloth will lift and absorb sticky , so keep using a clean spot on cloth . The cloth needs only be damp with alcohol , not dripping wet . Use dry spot on cloth to wipe clean the surface . <p> I tried rubbing alcohol , ram , paint thinner , laquer thinner , all with poor results . I had my best success with a diluted solution of tsp. ( 1tbs to a pint of water ) I used a toothbrush and clean dry rag to remove the residue . It did a reasonable good , but not perfect job . <p> You would think that with all of the complaints over the years that the manufacturer would have substituted more more appropriate material . When the first thing that appears in google search for Eton radios is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many thanks indeed . My Eton E1 nows looks better than new . About six hours of rubbing , wiping and patience ! Was spurred on by seeing the original white printing revealing itself . Final polish achieved by using a soft impregnated shoe mitt that are sometimes provided in hotels . All the best to all . WT <p> Dear Mike and all else , After successfully finding a good solution to this issue specifically with the Eton E1 and E1XM , I am now going to put myself on a limb and say that for those not brave enough to tackle the issue on their own E1 radios , I may be able to help them ( E1 and E1XM only for now ) . I have decided to offer this as a service to folks outside my circle of friends now . Because it takes anyplace from 4-5 hours to thoroughly remove the coating from these radios I am looking at charging $100 plus shipping . I know that sounds like a lot for a radio someone already spent a bunch of money on but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that they just find them totally unusable as they continue to get more and more gummy with age . Removing the gummy surface coating is not easy , takes a lot of time and some materials so the cost is actually reasonable for the effort . These radios , when they are not suffering from the dreaded display issues are well worth keeping alive and in play . One issue I wondered about before tackling my first subject radio was , is the lettering on top of or underneath the gummy residue ? Its under and pretty well painted on . Still , with some chemicals there is a chance of them rubbing off so if you do this at home , be cautious of the chemicals you use . <p> Sean , the service is worth your asking price but , sadly , a new Eton radio costs the same or less , money-wise . And that problem exists across the world of appliances , electronics and autos . Ownership ought to be obsolete . Leasing serves better , for a better world . Revenue from leasing leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed and manufactured in anticipation of their ongoing fixability ! Landfills left hungry ! and other subversions of todays unhappy status quo . <p> I had one of these I bought off of ebay a few years back that developed this stickiness . I thought it must be defective so I threw it out eventually . I recently found my original Eaton G10 and it had developed the exact same issue , plus it was completely covered in cat hair ! So far I 'm resisting the temptation to chuck it . <p> I used olive oil and paper towels to clean this gunk off . It works great and does n't  leave a white residue . Oil and a cloth would be better than paper towels though . I use the same method on removing glue left over from labels or things like that . <p> I 'm not sure if its worth keeping this radio if this glue stuff will keep leaching out . Very dumb design for an otherwise great radio . <p> I tried the borax idea 5 dollar box of borax and dollar dobie sponge and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since i was trying to be careful about over saturating my dobie and getting a lot of water in the fr300 ( of course with no batteries in it , but still ) Not sure why he needed a vacuum cleaner but i just got the dobie damp , put some borax on and cleaned , then wiped with a dry towel right after Easy-peasy <p> If the radio is within its warranty period , I 'm sure Eton will help . Typically , though , the sticky residue surfaces after a few years of use . My G3 has n't  developed it yet , but a 7 year old FR-350 has . <p> Coatings which eventually become sticky have been applied to many consumer products , so shame on whoever sells it without adequate accelerated life testing . Although it increases grip , it less pleasant than a nice shiny finish in my opinion . I first encountered trouble with binoculars of both miniature and zoom varieties . I found sticky label remover very effective , but it must be used very sparingly to avoid " melting " the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated if the stickiness is not all removed in one go . To produce a shiny surface once the coating has been cleaned off , I use metal polish on a cloth . Make a sparing application and buff up vigorously . Repeat as necessary . My binoculars are now pleasant to handle and shiny in appearance . Much better . Because the hard plastic underneath has been exposed , I do not expect the surface to become sticky again . ( G4EAQ ) <p> I had n't  used my Eton in several years and just discovered that it had this problem . I used paint thinner ( not laquer thinner ! ) applied sparingly to a paper towel and cleaned half in about 5-10 minutes . The next day I did the other half using a paper towel and q-tips for the recessed areas . That was another 10 minutes or so . The haze mentioned above is not evident . I do n't  know why it would take hours to do this . Perhaps the coatings are different or maybe mine was so far gone that it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water based cleaner if it gets inside the radio it could be the end . <p> Was ready to discard the radio to the e-heap , but before that final act decided to google the problem , and oh my , so many with the same thing . I could not figure it out , used paint thinner ( a respondent just above me had success ) well I did not , it spread the gunk all over instead.Also tried nail polish remover to no avail , it became even stickier . Then wanted to buy a new one but I am glad I did not do that , would have been the same problem . <p> What about painting over the white sticky surface with clear lacquer or clear epoxy paint , while preserving the black lettering ? Any ideas ? The quality of the radio tuner is excellent and I would hate to trash it . <p> I did not have oven cleaner but I had Simple Green all purpose cleaner in a concentrate . So I tried some in a small area to see and it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use at ball games so was happy I was able to remove all the stickiness . <p> I used Elmers sticky out adhesive remover on my Eton e-100 . Like others have said change your rag often otherwise you 'll just smear the sticky residue all over . Radio turned out great in about 30 minutes . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384

It- includes specific suggestions for radios and other supplies ( food , medical , etc. ) one should have in stock in case of an emergency . <p> This is a lot of information , so I have broken it down into two posts : <p> I 'm no preparedness expertand I 'm certainly not a devotee of apocalyptic thinkingbut in the rural area where I live , in a passive solar home , preparedness is an everyday fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it snows , we can be stuck out here for a day or two at least .

Our- refrigerator- and freezer are solar-powered with battery back-up as well . When the power goes out , we may notice it , but only just . <p> We also believe in helping the neighbors whenever we can. - Oh , and a sense of humor helps keeps things in perspective . <h> In the wake of natural or man-made disasters , radio is your friend <p> As this thought-provoking video points out , no matter where you live in the world , communication is one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of control . <p> What type of radio do you need ? More than one type , in my view , if you can afford them . At a minimum , you should keep on hand the following : <p> One self-powered ( hand-crank ) radio with AM/FM and emergency flashlight . If you live in the US , this radio should also include the NOAA weather radio frequencies . <p> Several sets of fully-charged rechargeable batteries to power the shortwave radio and other devices like flashlights <p> Solar or DC powered battery charger <p> Other non-radio supplies ( see list at bottom of page ) <p> Ill start with recommendations of self-powered radios , then suggest a few portable digital radios and - self-powered shortwave radios . Finally , I 'll also include FEMA recommendations for supplies that should be kept on hand for emergencies , just in case . <h> Review of the - best self-powered emergency radios <p> Below , I 've laid out what I consider to be the best self-powered radios on the market today . Note that many of these radios can not receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NOAA weather frequencies are only helpful in the USA , please remember ) . During natural disasters or in times of emergency , local AM and FM stations tend to be more information-relevant than international broadcasters on shortwave . Of course , I believe you should have a shortwave radio on hand as well , so I have also provided a list of self-powered shortwave radios . <p> The Eton FR160 self-powered AM/FM weather radio with USB charger <p> Self-powered AM/FM NOAA weather radios <p> The Eton FR160 ( $30-40 US ) <p> The Eton FR160 is a durable , portable hand-crank and solar powered AM/FM Weather Band radio . Its quite easy to use and does a fine job tuning in local stations including NOAA weather radio ( you can chose from a selection of all seven frequencies ) . The FR160 has another very useful featureyou can connect any USB-based charger into its built in USB port and use the radios hand crank to charge your cell phone or other portable USB devicevery cool ! Be aware that it takes a lot of cranking to charge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in an emergency , its worth the trouble . The built-in LED flashlight is also very bright and lasts a long time on 2 minutes of cranking . The solar panel is adequate for charging the radio or for playing it ( in full sunlight ) . <p> The Eton Scorpion self-powered AM/FM Weather radio with built-in caribbeaner and bottle opener ! <p> The Eton Scorpion ( $50-60 US ) <p> The Eton Scorpion is very similar to the FR160 , but has the added features of an auxiliary- line-in input , a larger solar panel , and is splash-proof . The Scorpion has an aluminum carabineer- to attach it to your belt or pack , a bottle opener , and is overall a very rugged device , so is ideal for camping , too . <h> Other self-powered AM/FM/NOAA weather radios worth considering <p> Eton Corporation also produces the- Axis and RoverI have never used these , but assume they would be worth considering . Eton is certainly the king of self-powered radio technologies and produces many of their radios branded with the Red Cross . Theyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band radios as reliable as those produced by Eton . <p> The Grundig G3 or Sony ICF-SW7600GR ( in background ) are both reliable and have excellent SSB reception . <p> Shortwave radios <p> I strongly recommend you have a capable , full-fledged digital shortwave radio tucked away for- emergencies . If you already own one , just make sure you always have fresh batteries for it standing by . <h> Self-powered shortwave radios <p> While these radios lack SSB and the advanced functionality of the modern digital portable , they can operate with the turn of the crank . - This is great , just in case you forget to have a set of fresh batteries among your supplies . All of the radios below have excellent- reception characteristics for an analog radio . Why did I only choose analog radios ? - Mainly because I have yet to find a self-powered digital shortwave radio that has the sensitivity of the analog ones , or the battery longevity . Digital radios look cool and are great for casual use , but I would n't rely on one in an emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market as the Tecsun Green 88 , this little self-powered radio packs a big punch . <p> Tecsun Green 88/Grundig FR200 ( $25-35 US ) <p> My all-time favorite self-powered shortwave radio is the Grundig FR200 or Tecsun Green 88 . This radio used to be widely available as the Grundig FR200 , but Grundig has since stopped producing it . The radio can , however , still be purchased by Tecsun Corporation from vendors in Honk Kong on eBay ( link provided below ) . 42381 @qwx662381 42386 @qwx662386 42387 @qwx662387 42384 @qwx662384
