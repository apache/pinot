And that in itself is a good enough reason to come here . But , with a harbour in which sleek yachts are moored alongside historic working boats , it is also home to a thriving arts scene , sandy beaches and excellent restaurants . There 's loads of things to do here , ranging from water sports and art exhibitions to beach life and festivals that celebrate life by the sea , and it 's unsurprisingly popular during the summer . But it 's worth braving the crowds for what is one of the most active , thriving yet historic towns in Cornwall . <h> History <p> When Pendennis Castle was built in the 16th century , Falmouth was little more than a fishing village on the outskirts of the main market town of Penryn .

By the 19th century Falmouth Docks Company had been founded , and this marked the start of the thriving shipbuilding industry that survives here to this day . <h> Falmouth <p> Dripping with maritime heritage , yet this is also south Cornwall 's premier cultural hotspot .

The long-standing Vietnamese and Turkish communities provide great restaurants , and there 's been a more recent rash of great little coffee shops , where the brews and the baking are second to none . The area is not shy of stylish places that offer more substantial meals however . You 'll find a handful of bars and pubs in the area , from gastro-food places to traditional boozers , and there are a couple of venues , too , that are great for alternative music .

Plates stacked with slabs of fudge , bordered by the colourful swirls of rainbow lollipops beckon you in from outside and once within the smell will have you hooked .
