@@101577968 @5777968/ <h> Blog : How to connect the buying and delivery experience with consumers ' high expectations <p> With consumers shopping online more than ever before , an ever growing demand means retailers are feeling the pressure to fulfil customers increasingly high expectations . The whole customer shopping experience requires careful consideration ; from the checkout to delivery to returns . I headed to the EDelivery and Internet Retailing Expo at the NEC to find out how some of the biggest names in retail approach multichannel fulfilment , click and collect and what this means for the online shopping experience . <p> At this year 's event , we heard from Lana Jackson , Head of Online Operations Development for New Look , Dave Crellin , Head of Online Operations Development for Sainsbury 's and Walter Blackwood , former Director-Group Logistics for Mothercare . The panel acknowledged that the right mix of product and value is the main reason for consumers making a decision to buy , but that delivery propositions can be hygiene factors eroding the experience . So how best to manage these obstacles to ensure a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer 's are now expecting a lot from the delivery process , so managing the customers expectations throughout the buying and delivery stages are key ; ensuring these align to your brand reinforces your positioning and helps the consumer connect and identify with your values . <p> The panel had some simple and useful tips for retailers . They agreed that retailers should : <p> + Manage relationships with carriers to ensure both parties work together . This is especially true as the carrier is a representative of the retailer 's brand . Treating delivery as a commodity could have a negative effect on brand image . <p> + Listen to how the customer wants to receive their order . <p> For online retailers , the tangible elements of the shopping cycle are vital , with packaging an important element . I saw some fantastic packaging solutions on show at the event , from innovative materials to lock fragile items in place to ensure a safe journey , through to luxury branded boxes to help make the customer feel like they are receiving a present rather than just an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final step in the shopping experience with returns also a hot topic on the day . IMRG recently reported that 74% of consumers consider a good returns service important when selecting who to shop with but only 61% are actually satisfied with the service they receive . <p> It was suggested that you might not hear about problems but the consumers will vote with their feet and not buy from you again . I would say the same could be said for the original delivery , whether this is due to lack of choice or the level of service received ; customers may not post reviews , tweet or even call in but just disappear and be another number lost within your big data . <p> With expectations ever increasing and consumers wanting more and more - how can you keep up ? <p> Attending a conference interview with Will Lockie from Evans Cycles , I heard how they approach meeting their customers needs . 50% of their online orders are destined for click and collect in store , mainly due to customers wanting to try on or try out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximise the sales opportunity whilst having full control on the experience . They combine the ease of ordering online with expertise in store to enable the customer to feel empowered in the purchasing process . They have listened to their customers and found an approach that meets the customers shopping needs . <p> Providing a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience is a key factor for repeat sales . But what if you do n't have a store estate , how can you provide a flexible shopping experience the consumer will remember ? Online reviews and live chat facilities can help provide a human element , and pickup from collection shops or lockers could provide flexibility . A seamless delivery experience , that is convenient for the consumer , will give them a painless shopping experience enabling them to get their shopping buzz and link the gratification on the new purchase to your brand .

Such label production would , he stressed , be far cheaper than any of GFS 's competitors . <p> The GFS software will be tiered , meaning that smaller customers shipping fewer than 50 parcels a day will face no on-going charges while larger clients will pay minimal transactional fees but have additional features , such as ' smart-routing ' and E-commerce shopping trolley integration . <p> Mr Cotty added that subscribers would even receive free support to set up the system , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , whereas rival firms often charged thousands of pounds per installation . <p> " We are giving subscribers all the tools that they need to manage their shipments more easily than ever before without having to pay anything .

@@101578076 @5778076/ <h> Giving e-Shoppers a Little Checkout Cheer <p> The UKs delivery industry has undergone a dramatic transformation in the last decade . Parcel carriers , in particular , have seen the nature of their work and the kinds of items which they carry shift . Having principally moved goods between business customers not so long ago , they are now the agents of e-commerce , helping retailers move an increasing volume of online purchases to consumers . <p> The efforts which carriers have made and the challenges which they have overcome in order to cope with the change have been considerable . They cant have been pleased , then , to read the findings of a new survey by the Consumers Association , Which ? , which concluded that problems with delivery were among the main pains for those who choose to shop via the internet . <p> Having to pay for postage and packing , inflexible delivery options and having goods left somewhere " inappropriate " irritated some of the 14,000 consumers who took part in the research . The findings meant that , according to Which ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of its delivery partners " . <p> It can be argued with some vigour that the last few years have not been easy to carriers . Business change , rising business costs and even bad weather have all been critical factors . Even the Royal Mail , considered the preferred means of receipt by e-shoppers , has been afflicted by strikes . <p> However , is the latest criticism wholly justified ? Is it not more a case of Who ? rather than Which ? when it comes to determining the reasons why consumers may be chaffing at the Checkout ? <p> It would be interesting to note whether the rationale behind the provision of delivery options was taken into account this time around . There is a growing body of evidence to illustrate how allowing shoppers to pick from a broad , transparent range of delivery methods is key to their satisfaction . <p> The increase in alternative delivery modes , including parcel shops , drop-boxes and click and collect , to complement the now standard next-day service could be argued as offering no excuse to those e-tailers who fail to keep customers happy .

They want their delivery at a time and a place most convenient to them . Having the ability to choose the date , time and method of delivery is a critical factor in ensuring that they do not abandon their online shopping cart in favour of another retailer which offers greater choice . <p> Whilst choice is a customers basic requirement , though , achieving it in a simple enough fashion is not so straightforward and requires specialist software to bring about . <p> In addition , on those occasions when exceptions do occur , these parcel and carrier management systems can address any issues quickly and pro-actively in order to maintain the high quality customer experience to which retailers aspire . They amount to a perfect combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the impact of any true failures while liaising with the retailer and their customer . <p> Such an operation means that even when individual issues can not be corrected , retailers are provided with the opportunity to explain to a customer what has happened and , importantly , how the matter will be resolved - rather than having them wait in all day for a delivery which is not going to arrive . That facility is critical because it can mean the difference between repeat business or not . <p> As some of GFSs retail clients have found , having effective , pro-active systems means they can avoid receiving calls from clients who are unaware of what is happening but upset because their purchase has not arrived when and where it should . <p> Smart delivery management software has already brought e-commerce a series of benefits , including improved prospects of first-time delivery success , a reduction of inbound calls from unhappy customers and an improved relationship with their supplier partners . <p> All that enables a retailer to concentrate on its core activity and what it does best : selling its products .
