Low and hi trucks are no more than 1/4 " different in height - yeah that 's it ! You all think , " ZOMG ! I cna flip betterz ! ! ! Dis is da Shiznits ! ! " . It 's all pure BS ! ! 1/4 " of difference is not going to make any difference , it 's all psychological . I use high trucks because I do n't want my wheels even closer to my board which = wheel bite . <p> And to be honest , if you really want to believe all the hype behind it I can counter it . So , let 's say 1/4 " difference makes your flip better because of a 1/4 " tighter center of gravity ( which is laughable ) . But on the flip side I can tell you that having your board closer to the floor means less tail angle so you get less ollie height . So , with low trucks you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People used to kickflip 10 " wide boards/trucks when I was skating in my youth and those trucks were uber-high and on top of that we used 1/2 " riser pads ! <p> This industry has gone through plenty of money-sucking scams such as aircore wheels . Yeah , wheels are soooo heavy that aircores make you a better skater ! Yeah , those few ounces make that much difference . You 'll only find you blowing out those wheels and needing to buy another set at $40 . <p> I 'll also mention , during my youth we rode around not only with those 10 " wide decks and trucks but we also primarily skated wheels over 60mm in size .

You do n't want to be like how garb was a few years back ... Hah , found it kind of ironic now that some people want to copy people 's freestyle . <p> A good skateboard set-up will definetly not automatically make you a better skater ( unless you were riding a horrific board ) .

I do n't  try to emulate them , but that 's how i 'm comfortable skating , that 's how I flow . Hopefully that cleared up the confusion . <p> well Mullen , Renna , Terry and Keith skate a double kick , not sure about the others . I think other than mullen the rest skate traditional narrow boards &amp; trucks . I personally skate a Eastbilt New Era on Indy 129 's and Decomposed wheels but I 'm old and like a larger board <p> what a single kick is not hard to get , little wheels have them always in stock : - ) <p> i personality prefer a double kick hybrid or flatland deck , it is similar to a street deck but nose and tail symetrical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks ( they fit on every width ( i can turn them to fit on every board width ) , little wheels wheels spezial urethane what can i more say , and little wheels bearings , and yoyo skate skidplates best abrasive resistent skids on the market <p> Personal preference ... no self promotion here . If you come from a street deck , a double kick / concave deck will be easier to adapt to in my opinion . I am an old guy who used to skate all these 80 's tooth pick boards , but now I feel comfortable on a modern day shape at 7.5x 29.25 " ( or thereabouts ) . <p> I skated on a traditional freestyle board in the 1980 's and early 1990 's .

So here is my guide on showing you how . LONG ... 1 . Secure a Location -an ideal location is secluded -has residents supportive to the idea , as in they will put up with it and not call the police to get it demolished Hint : try old basketball courts , drainage ditches , Abandoned game courts , and driveways ( ex. your own , your family 's , or your buds ) <p> 2 . Make sure your spot will be made unnoticeable -if you build a hagard ghetto concrete ledge in the middle of a old tennis court on the side of a highway , graffiti it , and then paint it purple , it will attract unwanted attention , whereas if you built a nice smooth ledge that is say on the side , and blends in with the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be quite as likely to the naked eye , and may look as though it is a bench , etc. and belongs . <p> 3 . Design your DIY spot - Get a program such as Google sketch up which is free -Become proficient in its use - take measurements of your soon to be spot - design a park that fits with the scenery . - stick to more subtle things like ledges <p> 4 . Determine how to build your obstacles -Use sites such as rampplans.org xtremeskater.com diyskate.com and many others -Ask around , ask people with experience , etc. -Design your own plans -Search youtube for diy spots for ideas -determine how to get your materials for free or cheap LONG ... I 'll give you two prime examples on a diy skate spot I created in my neighbors drive way . LONG ... 1 . The Cinder block ledge , We went too construction sites , and asked for , as well as stole cinder blocks , and a sheet of 3/4 " plywood . We bought Construction adhesive , in this case liquid nail from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle iron from a bed frame and cut it to size . We liquid nailed our cinder blocks together in the space provided , liquid nailed a piece of ply to the top , then liquid nailed the cut ( Had to cut it to size and cut some of the side pieces off . ) Angle Iron to the corner . We then Painted it Tan to match with his backyard . ( this was built according to his found plans on diyskate.com ) <p> 2 . Our " Euro gap " -Their was a hagardy stair set made of concrete on the side of his garage , about 3 ' tall and had broken steps passed the second stair . their was about a 12 ' long 4 ' wide landing space . I took some 2x4 's , cut them to angles , and made a frame , pushed it against the 3rd stair on the set , their were 5 total , this stair was longer . put weights from my weight set up against it to hold it in place . I then Filled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and layed some fencing on top . This was all done for free as I had the parts laying around . Then we went to home depot and bought our quick crete/Concrete , we removed the weights from the bottom but left the frame in , we poured in the quick crete/concrete , and took a 2x4 cut to the frame , and then smoothed it out down the frame . It was a smooth surface . I then took a scraper for getting crap off stuff and smoothed out the bottom lip and we let it dry , a few days later , we could go from the start of his drive way , and air off his euro gap , or air down his euro gap and hit the ledge . ( due to lazyness we never removed the wooden frame lol ) A year or two later , Its still standing good as new except for rot on the plywood sheet on the cinder block , rust on the angle iron , and rot on the 2x4 's . LONG ... These are prime examples that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoyed for generations , and extremely fun both to build and skate .

The picture 's taken from street view alongside a highway , but it can be hard to notice , and in all of the time I 've been skating this spot , I 've never been told to leave , or had a problem .

I want to buy a new deck but I HATE a deck with even a little concave . It makes the board hard to control for me . Hard feeling to describe . <p> Anyways , I was wondering what kinds of decks have little to no concave , but earlier today I had a conversation with a friend that told me that you need concave to catch the board after flip tricks . The problem is , I 'm a beginner and I can only do moving ollies so I have no way of finding out whether concave is that important . ( Not to sound ignorant ) <p> So my question is , what good quality decks have no concave , and is concave important ? <p> toy machines are flatish boards but no pro deck is going to have no concave and no pro deck is going to have allot so if you get used to it it will help in the long run i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dude .

I used to ride an 8 but I did n't like the little cave so switched to a 7.5 which had quite a bit . It could depend on the board too . <p> if you 're a beginner you really do n't know what you like . most of what you 're perceiving to affect you is actually all in your head . <p> the concave is having minimal effect on your " control " if any . it really only affects how the board flips and even then it 's pretty minimal . <p> i remember thinking that high trucks would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason i was having trouble . in reality i just sucked at ollies and the only secret to being better at them is practice . <p> The last man on earth was sitting in his living room when he heard a knock at the door ... <p> I absolutely hate a ton of concave .

Then I recommend using a thicker oil , one that will not sneak past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearing for a long while to come . <p> WD-40 does not in itself ruin bearings . I will explain what happens . <p> WD-40 is made to be extremely viscious(thin) in order for it to be able to penetrate deeply into tight areas ( like a rusted on nut ) . This is why you can spray it on the outside of a metal shielded bearing and it will most times make it way inside . It is really good at penetrating . Now good , your crappy metal shielded bearing is running awesome , for a time . Now give it a couple days or maybe a week . That same great property allowing it to sneak into your bearings has allowed it to sneak back out of them leaving them dry as a bone with no protection what so ever . So now your bearing rust and eat themselves away . <p> Your best bet is to use the wd-40 as a solvent/flush and lubricate them with something thicker ( speed cream , 3in1 oil , clean motor oil , vegetable oil etc. ) and always use your outer shields . 161563 @qwx1021563 
@@108987482 @4387482/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <h> My Almost Skateboard Deck Review <p> Hey everyone , this is my review on decks manufactured by Almost . <p> My time with the Almost Deck Well , to start off , I 've had my Almost for about a month . I 've had 3 decks before this , and I 'd say that this is the best one yet . I have an Almost Rodney Mullen - LONG ... and I find it absolutely amazing . <p> Durability - Well so far , the durability is amazing . Absolutely no chips , pressure cracks , or anything . The only problem is , this board razor tails very easily . I do n't do manuals or anything like that , so that 's a problem . I have 2 other friends who have had this same exact deck , and they were also bothered by the razor tail ( the board lasted them about 3 months ) so for the durability , I would say about 6/10 <p> Concave - To me , this boards concave is just right . It 's mellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so flat that your foot can slip right off the tail . I give this concave a 9/10 <p> Pop - Well , for pop I would say it is amazing . I can ollie very high with this deck , and with my kickflips I can actually feel the catch . It 's very pleasant to feel the catch on a trick as you all know . I have razor tail but the pop still has n't worn down , so I give this boards pop a big fat 9/10 <p> Graphics - Well , this all really depends on the person , but I think Almost has some pretty awsome graphics and designs , but do n't get the board just because of that , I mean , come on , for me the graphic wore out in about 2 weeks from just boardslides lol . Anyway , I 'd give the graphics a 10/10 <p> Size - Well , the board I have is a size 7.7 which is just where I like it , not too big and not too small . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot who ) in that story with the 3 bears and the poridge . Not too hot ( big ) not too cold ( small ) just right ( 7.7 ) I 'd give the size a 10/10 <p> Shape - I think the shape is a good find , because a lot of the decks that I 've skated before have had a weird ovally shape to them , but this board is n't like that . The only problem though is , the tail is a bit less rounded than the nose . I 'd give the shape an 8/10 <p> Flip/Spin - Well , this one 's interesting . This board is pretty light , and it spins pretty easily . Now , this was n't a big problem , but it gave me a little thing to get used to because I was used to flick my tricks a little harder than with this board , but it gave me an advantage in the long run . The only little problem is , it gives me a little problem with board control , but the pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8/10 <p> CONCLUSION <p> Well , this is it . In all , I love Almost . My overall rating for Almost Skateboards is 9/10 ! which in my opinion is pretty good . Almost has a great team , great boards , and great everything . So , would I recommend you to go to your shop and get an Almost ? <p> 2nd almost impact chris haslam in a row , it 's such a sick board ! ! i 'm going with girl next though , because they have sick boards , great pop , great durability , interesting picture lol , good size for me ( found one ) awesome board , great team ( Mike Mo ftwwwww ! ! ) <p> Your giving a review on your fourth board ! ? I do n't  mean any offence its just you do n't  have much experience with boards to compare it to . Wait till you 've had a few boards from every company going then when you get a board that blows the rest out of the water start shouting , you just sound a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost boards and i personally do n't  like them , and I am nothing short of astounded that it lasted you three months as mine lasted around three weeks . Aside from that the review was very well written and constructed for someone who is 11 . <p> " I just found out that my ex wife has been struck off my health insurence . SPICEWORLD ! ! !

I always used to ride pretty narrow decks , my current one is 7.75 but now I read that so many of you are riding decks of size 8 and above even with significantly smaller feet ... <p> So now I am considering getting a 8.5 " deck and 149 Indys but I have no idea what board to get exactly . Most of the companies that are well known for their street skating teams do n't seem to carry decks this wide and I 'm not sure a Bob Burnquist pro model is the way to go for skating street . <p> Who of you does street and rides a 8.5 " deck ? What deck exactly do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different qualities of boards ( durability , weight , concave , etc ) are discussed but it 's always about &lt;8 " decks ... I 'd appreciate any concrete recommendations <p> I 've been riding 8.25s ( Habitat right now ) lately but I 've got an 8.5 ' ' Deckcrafters 3 Fish on the way . That deck is marketed to pool skaters but has a normal street shape . Same thing with some of the Old Man Army decks . <p> Any 8.5 ' ' with a double rounded kicktail , 32 ' ' -34 ' ' long will work for street . It does n't matter what brand name is on it or what pro model it is . <p> The Bob Burnquist deck would be fine . The shape is basically the same as a standard street deck , just bigger . Same thing with the wider Creature decks . <p> Shape/Concave is really a matter of preference . For a mellowish concave look at some Habitat decks ... some of them also have a steeper concave . <p> If you like a board that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concave , go for a street shape that is marketed to pool skaters ... brands like Deckcrafters , OMA , Embassy , Cockfight , etc . Socalskateshop has a lot of that stuff . <p> DLX also makes some wider decks but I 'm not a fan because I do n't think they 're very durable . Shapes are nice though . <p> Thank you so far for your advice , as a matter of fact , the online shops you mentioned carry quite a lot of 8.5 " decks . The problem is that I do n't live in America so it wo n't be that easy ... <p> But it is definately good to know that the wider boards , which are obviously promoted as pool decks are of the same shape and can be used for street as well . I thought that most decks of 8,5 " and up were designed especially for vert/pool/cruising and these kind of riding styles . <p> After doing some more research , i found this one , a Mini Logo Amok : <p> LONG ... <p> Would that be ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice shape , with concave and everything . <p> I 'd also appreciate if everybody else who is using 8.5 " decks for street would post his setup ... <p> I have never heard of that brand but the shape looks fine . Finding out where the deck was pressed might give you some clues about the quality . A lot of stuff that comes from China is very cheaply made , for instance . My best advice is to just check out what your local shops have . Shipping anything as heavy as a skateboard from the U.S. to Germany is going to be very expensive . <p> In general , the whole vert/street divide is largely marketing B.S. As long as we 're talking about decks with a double kicktail and a " normal " street shape they are essentially the same exact decks that street skaters use . Only difference is that they 're a little wider and might have a slightly deeper concave and maybe 1 ' ' of extra wheelbase . Other than that they 're made with the same materials , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind is that some " street " pros ride 8.5 ' ' decks or close to it ( like 8.4 or whatever ) even though their pro model may be a different size . That 's because most people buying boards are little kids and an 8.5 is going to be too big for most of them . So the board companies make what little kids will buy . James Hardy , Chris Cole , and Arto Saari ride big boards , for example . <p> With wheels , you have the same B.S. A lot of younger skaters will say that you ca n't skate street with anything over 53mm or whatever . That is pure B.S. Lots of east coast skaters rode 55-58mm wheels on STREET back in the mid 90s and were doing most of the same tricks you see skaters doing now . <p> Thanks , I 'm really starting to like this place , lots of knowledge and nice people : - ) <p> As for the wheels , I thought of getting 52mm autobahns , I am used to small wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's basically just about the deck , I 'm pretty much 100% positive a wider deck will help me progress a lot . <p> Now that I know some names , I actually found 8.5 " pro model decks from flip , zero , and also girl . Just do n't know what would be better suited for me . ( I do n't have the option of examining boards at a skateshop around the corner , i 'll have to order online anyways ) <p> I have to say I am a little worried about the setup being way heavier than my old one so it might be a better idea to buy an expensive deck after all , I figure these are lighter , designed in a more elaborate way i do n't  know ... <p> One little question about trucks . On the zero webpage Chris Cole says he rides 149 thunder hollow trucks on his 8.5 " deck . Most forum people seem to prefer Independents over Thunders . Could anyone tell me something about this , too ? Is there even much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to be anything that is going to make any meaningful difference in the way you skate . 7 ply maple decks of roughly the same size are going to be very close in weight . Biggest you are going to see is *maybe* 1-2 ounces . There are 16 ounces in a pound . You do the math . <p> Same thing with " lite " trucks . The difference ends up being a few ounces , max . Pretty gimmicky , IMHO . That kind of stuff mostly appeals to little kids . <p> As far as Thunder 149s vs . Indy 149s goes , that 's personal preference . Both trucks ride pretty differently in terms of the way they turn . Thunders turn very quick at first then mellow out quite a bit through the turn . Indys have a very even , carve-like turning radius the whole way through .

I skate street and park as well . <p> Until recently , I have been skating autobahn aero 50s . They are treaded wheels . <p> But recently I switched them to a blank ( 54 or 55 mm ) old set of nontreaded wheels I have . <p> My take : I wanted the lowest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me it did n't matter , but for me it made a HUGE difference . Being lower to the ground meant less of an angle needed to pop . If you already are good with ollies , the size difference wo n't matter much in my opinion . And if you can ollie well , than the other flip tricks should be attainable ( i guess , I am still working on kickflips myself ) . <p> One problem with small wheels is that they do not roll well over cracks . So a small wheel will hang you up in places a larger wheel will roll through . <p> Also small wheels will not roll as fast and will slow down faster than larger wheels . So if speed ( and not having to work extra hard to maintain speed ) is a priority , then a larger wheel will work better . <p> As far as treads go , I prefer my non-treaded wheels . Or when my treaded wheels are dirty and worn-down . I find that the treads make it really hard to slide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slide in my wheels . <p> I too am looking for a new set of wheels .

But really a few mm at either end of the spectrum if they 're in your size range wo n't matter . <p> Big wheels are great for vert and pools skating with hi trucks and riser pads for less wheel bite . Big wheels have a higher top speed Big wheels are great for locking into pool or metal coping Big wheels roll over some cracks get stuck in others Big wheels are OG . <p> Small wheels accelerate faster Small wheels get stuck in cracks Small wheels are great for street as they are lower to the ground Small wheels are great for ledge grinds as they do n't get hung up Small wheels with tighter trucks = less wheel bite than big wheels with loose trucks Small wheels get smaller faster than big wheels Small wheels are OG if you started in the 90s

It is supposed to make the decks WAY stronger and a little lighter by making the plies thinner . The Kevlar is supposed to help the decks maintain their pop for a longer amount of time than the traditional 7 ply deck such as Anti-Hero which are very good decks IMO . But P2 also is said to not sag out like the traditional wood decks , and are more stiff thus giving the deck better rebound while doing tricks .

I did n't  get any major flatspots with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  feel as good as I had hoped they would on rougher surfaces but they were by no means bad on asphalt or rougher cement . <p> My final thoughts on these wheels is that if they only cost a few dollars less theyd be amazing but at the upper end of 25$ they 're just to expensive for the performance you get with them . I eventually did flatspot one and taking bearings OUT was even harder than putting them in. if you can find them on sale for 20$ jump on them but do n't  go out of your way to buy them at full price . <p> large image below <p> click to show <p> Last edited by Trebor ; 11-24-2010 at 08:45 PM . <p> The last man on earth was sitting in his living room when he heard a knock at the door ... <p> so i finally got these and you were n't wrong about getting bearings in they were all a little hard but one is stuffed the bearings seem to be in fully i have put all my weight down on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked and is n't right it must be a defective wheel cause none of the others have this problem ..

Any suggestions for more ADVANCED editing software ? <p> If you 're just filming with a phone then it probably not worth it to put any kind of money into a decent software .

BUT since I do straightforward editing I 'd choose Vegas . <p> If you 're on a Mac , however , you basically have Final Cut Pro X or Premiere .

Rick started a mutiny with other riders that felt that either they felt abandoned -which they were ... to an extent- and started girl right there and then . <p> On the Girl side ( according to what I saw in Man Who Souled the World and Mike Carroll 's interview with Active ) : Rick Howard ( alongside Mike Carroll and Spike Jonze ) wanted to form a team where they felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't give a f**k attitude and **29;222;TOOLONG aspects " that World Industries had .

That 's left for those two to debate on and admit the truth . <p> On Epicly Later 'd Carroll said that they ( he and friends ) just wanted off of PlanB , and went ahead and made Girl . But I do n't know why the name is what it is ... so I ca n't really answer your question . I just wanted to put in my 2 cents .

At higher speeds , you can slide pretty decently on softer wheels . Many long boarders have good times leaving their wheel marks when they do slides down hills . If you 're just doing street , it 's way easier to slide on harder wheels . <p> There 's videos on youtube that 'll give you " how-tos " . I 'm not experienced in either and have only seen it done in videos . The technique will be different because you will be going vastly different speeds , and that effects how you slide .

If you have the tires on a car aired up as high as they can go you have very little grip and no cushion . If you have less air in the tires then you have more grip and a cushion system in place as the tire will have some give to it . Same thing with skateboard wheels . The softer the wheel the more " give " it will have thus making it easier to ride over concrete and not feel the bumpiness . <p> bhp <p> 04-23-2011 , 11:37 AM <p> With a 58mm wheel , you could probably get away with just a 1/8 ' ' riser . And while that may take some getting used to , it should not affect your ability to do tricks at all .

When I say " right " or " left " that means feet . <p> For backside and frontside . If when you and/or the board spin and you open up your shoulders and can see right in front of you when you spin it is frontside . For example when you do a frontside 180 your shoulders open up and you face forward and you turn towards your front shoulder . For backside , when you turn towards your back shoulder and when your back faces the front of a spin it is backside . I also like to think of it as when you do a backside shove you kick BEHIND you . And when you do a frontside shove you kick in FRONT of you . For fakie/nollie , frontside and backside are reversed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn towards your front shoulder and your backfoot kind of kicks behind you . <p> For backside and frontside grinds . If you are facing the rail/obstacle you are going to grind , it is frontside . If your back is facing the rail/obstacle you are going to grind , it is backside . <p> Also since I am already writing alot . I might as well explain boardslides and lipslides . Okay so boardslide . If you are doing it frontside , your back will be going forwards such as .. If you are doing it backside , your front will be going forwards . <p> For a lipslide . Your back truck goes complete over the rail . So for a frontside lipslide your front will be going forwards . <p> So when going fakie or nollie . Say the rail is in front of you and you do a slide in which the foot you did n't  pop with goes over the rail , that would be a fakie frontside lipslide . <p> If I messed up anywhere please say so . Hopefully this helped all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . <p> When you are 90 degrees through the spin motion , the way you are facing at that moment is what side your turning . e.g. when I ride regular , then turn 90 degrees so that I would be facing the way I am rolling , I'ts frontside . When I turn 90 degrees the other way , that means my back is facing the way I am rolling , it is backside . <p> This applies to all stances except fakie . In fakie when I face forwards 90 degrees through the spin I am turning backside . When my back is facing towards the way I am rolling , it is frontside . <p> Simple . <p> Originally Posted by cptn craig <p> worst case scenario , water and bugs are found , we get samples brought back to earth , everybody dies from infestation , apart from one scientist with access to a special hazard suit and crowbar <p> Yeah , fakie slides and grinds are always a little tricky to name . The whole reason fakie is a bit different , is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board . Its the one stance where the tail is moving forwards . And like , if you did a fakie tailslide , it would be like a fakie ollie and then your popping end lands on the ledge .

Durometer is just a measurement , 83b-84b works out to be less than 100a but it measured with a different ( sharper point ) shaped tool .

Morning , noon and night , just being a skate rat , watchin ' the videos ( Animal Chin , did they ever find him ? ) , doin ' the skate thing , great days them wuz . Sometime around 1991 I quit for reasons unknown ( girls ? pot ? drink ? band ? gee , I wonder ! ) and did n't really think about it much , had a lot of strange years about that time , Navy , college , bike messenger , band , kid , cats , blah blah and so on . Well , here I am , 20 years , 600,000+ beers , 5,000 miles , one kid and 150 pounds later , I wan na get back into skating ! ! ! . I went into a skateshop for the first time in 20 years a few weeks ago , and WOW , things have changed ! Decks are all the same shape , I do n't recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain ) , trucks are all painted and by companies I do n't remember , even the grip tape is different ! 20 years is a lot of time to pass by , just look at how much cars have changed in that time . Ok , enough about that . My question : I peeped ( do kids still say I peeped something ? Or is that too 90s ? ) some of the equipment , and as an old skool guy , I got ta say , I cant put too much faith in these decks they have today . First impression is , they look downright flimsy ! 6 ply ? MADE IN CHINA ? ? Huh ? Not trying to sound too gramp-ish , but in my day , everything was made in Southern California and it was BEAST . You could run a car over a board and it would flex but not even break . What happened ? They were heavy as bricks compared to the completes today , I 'm sure they 're a heck of a lot more responsive and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na skate again , so should I get one of the new decks ? Are there any still made in America ? The guy at the local shop did n't know . What are the strongest trucks ? In the dinosaur days of the 80s it was Indys . I could order online an old school deck ( anyone have an original Tony Hawk skull and cross for sale email me ) but want to support the local shop . What do you guys think ? There 's a free skatepark just down the street from me , and it 's brilliant , 6 foot half and all ! ARGH ! This old goat needs some advice ! Thanks , E <p> I do n't know about six ply 's never seen that . Just pick up a 8.5 and go skate . About half of Powell boards are still made in the US here in Southern CA . Indys are still king . Not that much has really changed more companies but they come and go . Everything you new before still holds true today . Only thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the average kid today . With skateparks everywhere and great people like us as fathers that love to skate and have an even better time when you 're skating with your kids , kids are better than ever . <p> I want to hear about the cats . I think the new decks would be fine aslong as you can make sure they 're a reputable company . I thought most decks were made in canada ? atleast they 're made from canadian maple ... does that mean they 're from canada actually ? ! ahh who knows . Independent trucks are a safe bet too . <p> Yeah Indy 's are still Indy 's , those ai n't gon na change . And do n't worry about the durability of the deck , trust me it 'll last . 7 plys of canadian hardrock maple is far more durable than you might think . For most decks the wood is either American of Canadian and only the pressing and painting actually happens in China , the rest is still american . <p> Originally Posted by Vit <p> Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , she 'll probably hide when she sees you walk in . If she does , you will be " sponsored " by your shop 's owner 's daughter . <p> First , decks are not all the same shape . If an " old school " setup is what you crave , you can get that as old school " reissues " are a pretty big thing now . The local shop might not carry that stuff but there are various online sources and shops that specialize in fishtail style 80s vert boards , NOS trucks and big wheels , thick riser pads , etc . Check out Socal Skateshop online maybe . <p> There are even some board companies that specialize in hybrid old/new school boards that have a kicktail on the nose with a larger squared off kicktail and are 9 " -10 " wide . <p> If this is the kind of thing you crave head over the forums at Old Man Army or Concrete Disciples and they should be able point you in the right direction . <p> As for " new school " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started skating around 94 so that 's what I got used to . I will say that most decks today are definitely not quite as durable as the ones that used to be made in the USA . There are a few board companies still pressing decks here but they 're the exception , not the norm . <p> Indys are still great trucks and are still quite strong . Some of the hanger material has been shaved away over the years making them lighter and providing a little less " meat " to grind on but I do n't think there is anything better on the market . You can still get them in a variety of widths if you need wider trucks to fit a wider board too . They 're still made in the USA also . <p> RE : weight , if you are pushing 300lbs I would encourage you to get on some type of diet/exercise program . Skating might actually be a step in that direction . I do know that there are many guys in the 200-250lb range that skate with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If board strength is a concern , you might want to look into decks that are reinforced with a full composite top and/or bottom ply . <p> It seems that 80% of today 's set ups are designed to be light weight and provide " POP " ( flex and rebound ) for hopping up on to and over obstacles . That 's what most kids consider as fun these days . There are still longboards geared towards street cruising and old school reissues as previously mentioned . But , riding ramps is not the primary purpose of most of today 's boards . Different strokes , but it 's all out there and available . You will need to watch the truck bolt hole patterns . They have changed to a slightly smaller rectangle . Some reissues have " old school " bolt patterns that only match older ( pre 1990 ? ) trucks and some have the newer smaller bolt pattern . There are also trucks that have base plates with BOTH bolt patterns on them just to be safe . <p> not all boards made are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better quality than boards from the 80 's and 90 's . But anyhow the types of boards that i truly enjoyed skating real , flip , baker , and sk8mafia .

Do n't tailstop , cauious about your tail sliding on the ground . stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah ISZ over here kinda beat me to it , i was going to say the EXACT same thing except the 3rd line . i ca n't STAND using my nose as my tail , unless i 'm going fakie or nollie .. i mean .. it just does n't work for me. it looks weird , for one , looking at your tail , all screwed up , riding up high on the nose .. and it just feels like garbage . it gets more pop on fakie tricks though , not so much on reg <p> have you been practicing manuals ? that 's the biggest way to get it . also , landing upside down on your board ( frequently happens to me cuz i 've been learning harder tricks ) kinda does it a lot as well . <p> i 'm not really sure , i guess you can just prevent it by not tail stopping like ISZ said , and manuals junk it up , so practice nose manuals or something , and when you 're better at manualing , it wo n't happen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your board . <p> I got a darkstar armorlight . I had it about ... a year and a half now ? and it is just starting to get messed up now . Also , are you a newer skater ( like workin on ollies , manuals , pop shuv its ) or more experienced ( tre flips , heel flips , lazers ect. ) and what style are you ? I mainly ride vert and minis , so I do n't  ollie as much and stuff . It depends on alot of stuff ... <p> you have to pop your board in order to make the trick . Some tricks do n't require poppage though . <p> what ? you kids still doin ollies to get off the ground ? Seems like an awful lot of effort , the stomp , board bashes ground , springs up into air , got ta straighten it out , do some trick then finally land . I developed my own ollie which is far superior to the old-school ollie <p> what ? you kids still doin ollies to get off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomp , board bashes ground , springs up into air , got ta straighten it out , do some trick then finally land . I developed my own ollie which is far superior to the old-school ollie <p> .. you do n't only pop your board for the ollie ... alot of other tricks need popping , so " do n't pop your board " is n't an option in here unless the kid does n't want to learn pretty much the bunches of tricks that involve popping that street skating consists of . <p> EDIT : and there 's really no such thing as getting something that wo n't have razor tail after you skate it for a while lol , you can only temporarily prevent it a bit .... that is , you wo n't get razor tail if you basically just cruise around on the board and do n't drag it to stop .

You can be perfectly in shape and your legs are going to be tired because you are developing completely differant muscles in them . Even switching skating styles grows differant muscles in your legs and it will make them fatigue ... I know because I am in great shape and can run a 5:40 mile and skate all day long and my legs still get tired when I start trying something new , especially if it is a completely differant style of something . Once you are used to doing something your body finds more efficiant ways to do it which conserves energy but when you start something new your body is just trying to build the muscle to get it done . <p> The few people that just said " keep skating and it will go away " are the right ones , taking a break is going to grow the muscles but it is also going to slow your process of developing them .

So essentially , buying a jart gets you a Santa Cruz shape from 10 years ago with slightly inferior , heavier wood .

Is it the stuff that is very thin and dries in a couple of seconds ? <p> Yep ... be careful your you 'll glue your fingers together in no time Merging doublepost I seem to rip through shoes in no time when skating . I also have been ripping lots of laces lately . I 'm gon na try the super glue bit . I used to do shoe goo , but never liked the look of it . <p> It 's practically impossible to " protect " your shoes , skate shoe companies wo n't make money at all if they found a way to protect it . <p> You could prevent it from destroying faster than usual though . As everybody else in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitching works too . You ca n't prevent the rip of the sole from the bottom however . <p> Also , try to stay away from shoes that are canvas . Always go for suede ( or leather ) . If you want shoes that 'd last you for a long time , cupsoles seem to do the job . Vulcanized shoes rip and waste faster ( but the board feel is great . ) <p> It 's a gamble with shoes , its either comfort and strength or style and boardfeel.

They were a " sell out " brand that only posers wore . " Real skaters " wore Nike and Converse . Jordan 1 's were the ultimate shoe if you could find a pair . unless you got real lucky and found an old pair of Converse One Stars or Adidas Half Shells . Skating comes and goes more than any hobby I 've been involved in . Right now there happens to be a glut of skate related merchandise , but it 'll go away and only the hard core people will be left . As far as Nike goes , I picked up a pair of Abington 's for $21 , and the board feel is incredible . They 've held up quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . And the style transfers quite nicely between skating , work and just getting around town . 161563 @qwx1021563 <p> most of the people that buy expensive nike sb 's do n't  buy them because they skate they buy them because they collect shoes . For example my friend waits til a new shoe gets released , waits in line buys them for 150 bucks . Then he posts them online and sells them for 250 - 350 bucks since they only make a certain amount of them . Crazy i know . IMO nike 's are nice but i would n't spend that much on a skate shoe . Plus i love emericas , vans , and vox too much . 
@@108987592 @4387592/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <p> I like loose trucks with medium-slightly-firm bushings . That way you can set your feet up without wobbling all over the place but when you actually put weight into a turn like you want to it goes really easy . <p> Long answer = there are a lot of aftermarket bushings available some good ( Bones , Venom , Khiro , Riptide , Blood Orange , Abec11 , Divine ) some bad ( almost all the truck manufacturers and Dohdoh 's to start with ) but finding out what work for you is something that you will have to figure out . I personally like loose trucks and normall set up my boards as loose as I can comfortably skate . For me fat , soft bushings with little play/rattle in my trucks works out loose . I have friends who use medium bushings with a more play , that also works and can provide a lot of stability while maintaining a loose feel . Then there is the last way to get that loose feel hard bushings and rattling trucks . This is a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anyplace else <p> There are way too many variables for someone on here to tell you what you need to ride .

The noise of a ramp is generated in the gaps between the supports which act like speakers for the noise of the wheels on the wood . So , if those spaces are insulated in some way , filled with a foam or some soft material , they can be made quieter . Also , make sure your seams are tight and use screws to prevent rattling . Multiple layers on the transitions/banks with a final layer of masonite will also limit noise . <p> Rampster <p> 01-24-2011 , 09:27 PM <p> I built a skate park in the back yard and it was very loud . But after much experimentation , this is what I have found : Skate ramps are essentially like huge bass drums . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be . <p> 1 . Build a strong frame . The less give , the less vibration . Brace the areas of the biggest impact directly to the ground . In other words , " ground " the sound , just as you would ground an electrical charge . 2 . Put a layer of 3/4 " plywood over the frame . Use glue AND screws , not nails . 3 . MOST IMPORTANT : On top of the plywood , put a layer of Quiet Brace structural wall sheathing . This stuff is black and is made of wood fibers pressed loosely together . It really has no structural value , but it does absorb a great deal of sound and vibration . Plus , it 's not so soft that it sinks in under the top layer of wood or SkateLite , as polystyrene foam board ( insulating board ) would . Quiet Brace is available at Home Depot ( but not Lowe 's ) for about $9 a panel , and is half-inch thick and comes in 4 ' x 8 ' panels , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brace , put another layer of plywood , or if you can afford it , SkateLite , Ramp Armor or polycarbonate. 5 . Enclosing the ramp 's sides and ends completely also helps a little . Here again , you need a layer of Quiet Brace between the ramp and the outer wood . Preferably , the outer wood should be fence boards or decking , not plywood . Even with the Quiet Brace , a solid wall can still act like a bass drum . If you break it up with smaller boards , such as deck boards , tho , it helps a good bit . 6 . Protect the edges of the plywood and Quiet Brace from rain by caulking , painting or trimming it out with wood . <p> With this arrangement , you still have the high-end " whack " of the wheels against wood , but you take away much of the huge , low-end " boom " that comes from an uninsulated ramp . The sound becomes more like a baseball hitting a bat , instead of a freight train hitting the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fencing around your yard perimeter will further reflect some of the high-end noise away from the neighbors . Make sure the fence boards overlap , so there are no gaps between them . The taller the fence , the better . <p> Any questions , I 'm at concernd@cox.net . <p> SkateCalifornia <p> 01-24-2011 , 09:34 PM <p> I 've never heard of anyone doing this , but what if you filled the interior of the ramp with foam or something ? Might be expensive as heck . I have no idea what that would cost or if it would even work , but the fact that the inside of the ramp is hollow is source of all the noise . Foam insulation , perhaps ? Might do the trick . I have no idea . Maybe build a launch ramp as a test . <p> 303boards <p> 01-24-2011 , 09:34 PM <p> if you use softer wheels it 'll help a lot . and i 've seen mini ramps in houses with pvc pipe as coping , which does n't make as much noise <p> Aaronnn <p> 01-24-2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the neighbors if they care ? <p> Rampster <p> 01-25-2011 , 08:12 AM <p> I did , in fact , spray the underside of the ramps with the polyurethane expanding foam ( same as Great Stuff , but in bigger tanks ) . It did help a little , but it 's very expensive . The best thing I 've found is sandwiching a sound absorbant material , Quiet Brace , between the plywood and the top layer ( plywood or SkateLite ) . See my previous post above . <p> Number6 <p> 01-25-2011 , 06:37 PM <p> I 've never heard of anyone doing this , but what if you filled the interior of the ramp with foam or something ?

Their city series is one of the best i have seen , with its simple designs , it just appeals to a wide audience for those who want to support Australia and have a city of their favourite , well , city of Australia . They make some other quality graphics , like the kids series , with the " lame " monster prints , and the other logo series , with just a plain logo . Alhough graphics is n't really a factor for me , it might be for others , i would rate the looks a 7/10 . The cities series puts it higher in the scale , where as the kids series phails . <p> Durability : This deck is one of the lightest i have ever used , the strength of it is also good . I was speeding down a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jumping off , the board hit a curb straight on in the nose . It did not break the nose , it did n't  even dent it much . Just a small scratch , no biggy . The tails have not even razor tailed that much since i got it ( about a month ago ) and the pop is still holding up nicely . This is actually the first deck i have been able to ollie 3 decks with . Not saying cause its hell light and the pop is awesome , but also other factors like me practicing ollies etc . Overall durability on the scale is 9/10 . <p> Other Notes : Folklore is a Western Austraian Company . If you wish to support local skateboarding in Perth , and your in Australia , it wo n't be hard to find one of these boards , and best of all , its still cheaper than most boards at City Beach or Beyond Skate .

A real street skateboarding company , Ledgend will never produce a ' directional ' skateboard with huge noses and small tails . Modern street skating is switch stance , your board should be too . <p> Decks are available at select shops , online retailers , and directly through the Ledgend Outlet . A link to the website can be seen at no links for more information . <p> Ledgend is also the ONLY company to introduce a SkateSpec box that includes all of your vital dimensions so you know exactly what you are getting every time . Including width , length , wheelbase , nose , tail , concave , and kick . <p> most people prefer a " directional " design for a reason , you have much more versatility with two different sized kicktails. another thing is that most people skate their board backwards when going switch . its also not just deck shape that make skateboards directional , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a " back " truck that are both very individual in terms of tightness and overall feel . <p> oh yeah , there 's no free advertising on skaterscafe . <p> Last edited by Trebor ; 06-22-2011 at 12:54 PM . <p> The last man on earth was sitting in his living room when he heard a knock at the door ... <p> It 's an interesting debate over which direction people prefer because no company has ever offered a real 100% twin-tip shape before . Hard to say what most people like if there is only one option . Just thought the community might like to know that you now have the option to skate true twin-tip decks . <p> You 're right about the trucks , I still skate primarily a nose and tail , but now do n't ever have to worry about the board ever feeling " backwards " . I can never go back to directional boards after skating these .

@@108987628 @4387628/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <h> Ramped Slow-Mo in Sony Vegas 7.0 <p> I 've been asked by a couple fellow users to post a guide on how to do ramped slow-mo 's in Sony Vegas 7.0 . Well , here you go , a step by step tutorial ! <p> 1 . First , you 'll want to have your clip in the appropriate track and everything ready to go ( trimmed and such . ) <p> Overview of the Vegas work space <p> 2 . Once you 're ready to begin , click the Go To Beginning arrow , which looks like this : &lt; . That will take you to the front of the track . Once there , use the right arrow on your keyboard ( by holding it in ) to advance frame by frame through your video track . Once you get to the spot you want to start the Slow-Mo at , release your finger . You can fine tune it by just single pressing the arrows left or right . <p> This image shows where I am choosing to make my selection <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow-mo . Hit the " s " key on the keyboard to split the track . Now , use the right arrow button on your keyboard and press it twice . Then split the track again . Do this 5 or 7 times , depending on how long the trick is . The reason I do it 5 or 7 , instead of 6 or 8 , is because you want to have an odd number of splits . By having an odd number of splits , this insures that your slow-mo peaks on the even clip , then goes back down . It 's sort of confusing , but just trust me . <p> A picture showing the splits I made <p> 4 . After making your splits , move the back part of your clip over to the right to allow yourself room to edit . Spread your split clips out , too . <p> The above picture shows the splits and how I moved them to allow space to edit <p> 5 . Now , this is the fun part , and the most crucial part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first split . You will see that it turns into an arrow inside of a box . Hold down Ctrl ( control button ) , then click on the end of that clip and drag it to the right . You 'll see up top an arrow similar to -&gt; with a time behind it . Drag that until it says +0 ; 02 , or two tenths of a second . <p> View of the clip dragging procedure , you can see the +0 ; 02 at the top <p> 6 . Move your next clip over to the one you just edited , and do the same procedure as Step 5 , but take it up to +0 ; 03 . Then . move the next over , and take it to +0 ; 04 . Then work on the descent. ****Note . <p> *Note : If you split the original clip 5 times , after you do +0 ; 04 , go back to +0 ; 03 , then +0 ; 02 . If you split the original clip 7 times , your peak will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ya dig ? <p> View of the splits being connected <p> 7 . Now , move your last part of your clip back and attach it . Like all the other times you re-attached clips , the little blue line will appear in between them . <p> Illustration of a basic connection between clips <p> 8 . Now we must sync the sound with the slowed down clip . If you forget this part , your final clip will sound really retarded . To avoid confusion , I 'll show you how to do it one by one instead of grouping them and doing it in one step . <p> The sound bar is where your sound for each clip is located . Right click on each little sound clip under the video clip , then go to " properties " on the drop down menu . <p> This picture illustrates the sound bar and where it is , along with the sound clip ( highlighted in red ) accompanied by the pull down menu . <p> 9 . After clicking on " properties " from the previous step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the option for " Lock To Stretch " and tick that . By ticking that , it ensures that your audio is stretched with your video and becomes deeper . This is the famous noise you hear in slow-mo clips . <p> ***If you ca n't find the Lock To Stretch option , make sure your " Method " in the box is on " Classic . " <p> ***Never click the " Lock " box towards the top under " Switches , " that will just lock your audio from being moved . It has no effect on the slow-mo at all . <p> After ticking the " Lock to Stretch " box , click " OK , " then do that for all the clips you split . <p> Here I 'm displaying what to tick in the Properties box . <p> Once you 're done doing that , you can render your clip and bask in the glory of the fake ramped slow-mo ! 161561 @qwx1021561 <p> i suck so bad at ramps . i tried ramping a three flip of my friends for my first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees and end it when he started to roll away , i wnated the middle of it to be right in the middle of the trick but it always seems to ramp ramp way before or something .

Just make a nice DIY handle out of a piece of 1/8 " or 1/4 " piece of aluminum . <p> humm I guess it depends on what you are filming with ... most of the guys I skate/film with are either using a GoPro ( on a helmet or stick ) or if they are more serious a Digital SLR in a figrig .... but then we are mostly filming downhill/freeride not park/street so I guess there are differences in the amount of camera steadying needed . I used a Steadicam when I was in the service and I find a Figrig to be much easier to use . BTW most of the Loaded Longboards video 's are shot with a figrig <p> It will be steadier yes but if you make a sturdy handle that will be perfect for filming lines and such skating . I just do n't see a fig rig being very practical for filming skateboarding . <p> you do move when you are filming right ? unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the your movement and the weight of the camera better than just a handle . It works just as well at 30-40mph as it does at 5-15mph <p> Yes but my upper body stays still when pushing around on a skateboard , it 's something you learn to do after filming for a few years . I understand what you 're saying but , go and film a line with a fig rig and actually have the footage come out good ... <p> Who cares if it 's unnatural or not ? The point is to get your footage looking good and you do anything to do so .. <p> I realize they were going fast as **** in that video so it 's going to be hard to keep it steady but that footage was n't that great . Look at any of Jason Hernandez 's new videos , he films with DSLR 's and his home made handle that he also sells and that footage is on point . Smoothest follow cams ever and he does n't have a figrig or a glidecam in these videos .... http @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **** , i 'm not going to argue with you over this . <p> it was a RAW Run , the final edit used footage from the GoPros on people heads . <p> That handle is pretty close to a figrig , yeah I know it does n't have the halo but it accomplishes the same thing . It adds weight and gets your hands off the camera , allowing it to hang away from your body instead of being in your hands . Much of the footage below was filmed using the rig in the DIY I posted <p> I should probably also mention that I plan on having an external microphone mounted on top , and possibly a trigger , so I 'd prefer a traditional handle with a hot shoe attachment . If anyone could just link me to an X-Grip sold in Canada I can buy it from them , my main concern is getting raped by customs like I always do . 
@@108987636 @4387636/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <p> Well , vert/tranny . I skate mini very technically , and I skate vert ... mediocre . I can bs air , and do a little 5050 on a 13 footer , but that 's all . I think there is a lot more flow and a lot more natural feel skating halfpipes. doing a kickflip down a 6 just does n't FEEL right to me . <p> Street . I like it just because it 's more accessible and has more variety in terrain so it 's open to more creativity and challenges you more in how you think of approaching and handling an obstacle . However vert is still fun to skate though . <p> its like comparing just skating down the street - skating a fun box - skating a ledge- etc .... you are on your board ... its just what 's underneath you that changes .... i do n't  believe you can say one thing is better . I believe you skate what is available . If you have choices of what to skate then its up to how you feel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square to skate in a field , i would be skating that ... i guess my short answer is. what is available to skate at the time is the best . If you are referring to what is good to watch ..... for me it depends on the style of the skater ... if they have bad style but can do amazing tricks i would rather watch someone with not so amazing trcks but has rad style and Style is in the eye of the beholder . <p> Bahahaha , is this a joke ? You got ta be way more bold to jump down a big rail/stair set . Dropping in and skating some vert walls ai n't **** . <p> There 's a lot more to it than that bro .. Vert does n't involve just " dropping in and skating some vert walls " and even you should know that . <p> I think that both equally have a great role in skateboarding , and I think sitting here arguing which is better is a pretty null and void argument because , well , it really DOES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you can skate both , and are well-rounded , then that is a great advantage . Skating vert can help you with learning how to control your speed and balance , which helps a lot when skating street because the more contorl you have , the better . <p> There 's a lot more to it than that bro .. Vert does n't involve just " dropping in and skating some vert walls " and even you should know that . <p> Yeah actually it does . There are a lot of things you can do on those vert walls but that 's essentially what it is . Grinding the coping on the walls , airing off the walls , doing stalls and plants on the walls . It 's all skating vert walls . I suppose you could argue that there 's skating the deck of the halfpipe ( if that 's where the vert is ) can be involved , but that 's less ballsy than airing off the walls and certainly not as intense as flying down a huge set . Vert skating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big street drops and gaps . And unlike vert ramps and pipes , the stuff you skate in the streets is n't standardized for skating so it can be a lot more sketchy . I skate vert from time to time . The bails are much more mellow since you are n't going straight to flat and you can usually just kneeslide out of them . I 'm sure some tricks can be scary like if you 're inverting/flipping your body so you 're upside down but the obstacle itself is n't all that scary . Maybe I have n't skated large enough vert walls ? That one they had at the Berrics looked kinda gnarly . <p> What trumps them both in terms of what takes balls , is the Big Air Mega Ramp used in the DC video and in the X-games . I do n't think I 'd ever skate that even if I got the chance . <p> I am talking 8-10ft walls and up . And to actually skate vert pretty well takes a lot of nutting up . Trust me , vert bails can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontside airs on a 10ft wall and clipping and falling nearly straight to flat . Or even just doing a lipslide on and 8 foot wall and clipping and falling straight on your arm hurts like hell . <p> I mean sure you can really hurt yourself doing handrails and big gaps , I 'm not naive enough to believe that street is nothing . I 've had some really bad falls on street myself . But do n't talk about vert skating like it 's a walk in the park . <p> If you watched Grant Taylor skate in person , you would change your mind . <p> I 'm not saying it 's a walk in the park , and I 'm not saying that you ca n't get messed up bailing . When I say , skating vert walls ai n't **** , I do n't mean in terms of the skill it takes to skate it well , I mean in terms of the level of fear it gives me . Having skated Vert ramps 12 feet in height , I know what it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say people who prefer street do n't have the balls for vert and that 's just flat out false .

I like lows , the next guy might like highs . <p> It was a marketing ploy when they first came out . Everyone was skating around on the normal " hi " trucks . Then it was like , " Buy these new lows - you 'll be able to flip better ! " . But now all companies have hi 's , mids , and lo 's . When one company has the option and the others do n't it 's a marketing ploy cause you gain additional business . Once everyone else jumps in and starts offering the same the original company that offered lo 's no longer has a benefit . Get it ? <p> Wrong . Yes they do .

I order bones swiss because I had the money and everyone acted like they were fast ... deck comes ... i set it on a concrete floor ... one foot on ... BOOM on my ass ... that day I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings until you step on fast ones haha . <p> urethane is frozen because it is hot when it is poured into a mould . wheel companies freeze the wheels to help them set faster . placing your wheels in a freezer is n't going to make a difference on the quality or life of your urethane . <p> On the tighter shoes vs Bulky shoes thing . I 'd say that i do perform alot better in tighter ones because it gives me more board feel . From my experiencese they 've lasted just as long as bulky oens that ive had .. I really hate skating in bulky shoes though , especially ones with large tongues and really firm bottoms .. I like to be able to kind of grasp the boad . <p> In fact loosening your trucks will get rid of speed wobbles . If you have tight trucks , there is less give in the bushings so any small wobble movement will shock through the board into you and start you on a speed wobble bonanza . Meduim or looser trucks have more give and can take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first shock does n't  get transferred up to you , your your body doent tansfer the wobble back again , resulting in a more maneuvreable and stable ride when bombing hills . <p> *This was from a day of testing bombing a hill with some mates . If anybody else has had different experience with this , please say so * <p> dude that is definitly true , i bomb a hill everyday to get into town , loose trucks save my life when i get death wobbles , because when i do get them , i can align myself back into position by " carving myself out of the death wobbles " <p> The thing about the football causing more hospitalised accidents and injurys that skateboarding is true . I read that before . But its pretty much only true because a ) there are many many more footballers than skateboarders .

Just ride bones lol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super swiss 6 twice , and now ive got ta round to treating myself to some ceramics . I must say they 're better than any bearings ive ever owned or ridden before . <p> With certain metals , freezing at cryonic temperatures ( -320 degress for example ) re-alligns the molecular structure thereby eliminating molecular gaps - in other words it creates a tighter structure . A company called Dean Markley applies this technology to a line of guitar strings they make called Blue Steel . Skateboard wheels however are urethane so this does n't apply . Nonetheless , your common household refrigerator comes nowhere near even being close to cryogenic temperatures so freezing your wheels in you refrigerator would simply only make them cold . It has no benefitial effect on the wheels whatsoever . People will claim they can tell a difference but again that 's the placebo effect .

@@108987646 @4387646/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <p> According to Xgecko , mongo is superior for skateboard racing/speed trials . Having never raced or done any sort of skateboarding for speed measurements/timing , I bow to his expertise in that arena . <p> Mongo is n't better for street skateboarding , and I 'll explain why . Pushing mongo adds a step to setting up for a trick . When you push normally , you can set your front foot close to where it needs to be for the trick , push , then set the rear foot exactly where it needs to be on the tail , make a quick adjustment of the front foot , and bust . <p> Mongo pushers have to place the rear foot off the tail to keep the board from popping up or going out of control , then after pushing they have to put the front foot in a solid position in order to replace the back foot on the tail . Then they can set their front foot up for the trick . That 's more work than necessary . <p> And , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetics of what looks good while skateboarding are important . I think back to the Dog Town &amp; Z-Boys documentary , in which the Dog Town team discussed who was allowed to be a part of the team . If someone had a style that " smelled , " he could n't be on the squad and no one wanted to skate accepting it . Aristotle <p> Remember , information is not knowledge ; knowledge is not wisdom ; wisdom is not truth ; truth is not beauty ; beauty is not love ; love is not music ; music is the best . --Frank Zappa <p> Har I do n't defend Mongo , it just is , people push the way they push and haters make fun of what does n't conform . FTR many 80 's skaters pushed mongo because their rear foot was always on the board for dropping into a ramp . <p> Funny you should mention the Zboy 's I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he never mocked me for mongo , not to say that I did n't get mocked , my hand position during FS and BS carves and grinds was mocked until I changed the way I skated . Let me tell you when you are skating in a train around the park with Jayboy behind you mocking every style error you have , you change quickly <p> Personally I think it looks weird too but you should do whatever makes you feel comfortable . This is skateboarding , not baseball , there is no set way to do things , no rules , and no right or wrong . <p> But the reason I do n't like mongo is because when I push mongo my foot with all my pressure and most of my body weight is on the back , it feels awkward for me . I find it easier to shoot out or offset my balance that way . Pushing " normally " ( which is regular for me but this is the same for goofy ) My foot is placed mid board or towards the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my tail and pop , if I pushed mongo I would have to avoid being to far back , put my front foot on and then set my self up for a pop . <p> But YOU skate the way YOU want to . Which ever way to push feels natural for you , stick with it and practice , then when you are comfortable practice whatever you want to learn and you 'll get better over time . <p> Some people skate reg , others goofy , some even mongo . Some people shuv Backside with ease , other frontside . An so on and so forth , but what other people do an how you do it does n't matter . What does matter is what you like to do and how you like to do it . <p> Skateboarding is all about subjectivity . <p> To be a good skater is 10% being athletic , 45% dedication , and 45% heart . From then on , to be a better skater is 100% creativity and desire . Do n't compare yourself to others it will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your performance . Just go out and skate and have fun . <p> in the late 80 's , early 90 's when I skated the most I was mongo . No-one cared much back then . I was the same for a brief period in about 2000 . <p> When I decided to skate again for fun in recent times , I really took a look at my push and the limits it imposed on just my general style and then started learning regular . <p> Easier ****in ' said than done . <p> It took about a month for me just to get the jist of it then another 3 months to actually get full comfort and control of it and not look like a complete unctard trying to skate . In the end my setups became effortless and I probably look a crapload better too . I could finally focus on re-learning all my tricks and adding some new ones .... And steering IS even easier even though I find it simple in mongo anyways . And mongo DOES get you more speed if you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this of no real use to me . <p> A major plus of being " Once mongo " is that I just stepped into switch without any need to learn how to do it . I was like " **** YEAH " . My strong mongo foot was a total win there . In full kids . It probably took me 4 months to learn regular because I was mongo for so much of my life but it is so worth stopping and taking the time to learn to push regular . I believe everyone has a choice to do whatever , however they want . I 'm just giving some advice from someone who has actually been there &amp; really done it . <p> I 'm regular man . I 'm just very happy that I took the time to learn to push with my back foot . For street riding it gives all the speed I need . To learn , I had to studiously avoid pushing mongo EVER until I had it down pat . Now that the habit is well &amp; truly broken i 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could lean as far forward as possible and get a full sweeping push from in front of the deck to the full extension of my left leg . It 's hard to picture unless you know someone who can push mongo extremely well . ( I think this is why longboarders prefer mongo . ) But as I said above , for street skating that kind of speed is n't at all really needed . <p> All in all I think mongo really does look bad . I was one of the better styled ones but even then , my look &amp; skating style is 10 fold better after a short time of regular pushing . I enjoy being able to set up well before the nose of my board smashes into my chosen obstacle .

Just find a shoe that has a thinner , vulcanized sole and an insole you can remove so you can replace it with one that has arch and impact support .

Compared to being involved with George again and being a part of a reborn Powell Peralta , every other option just seems silly . <p> My goals are to simply help secure the legacy of Powell Peralta and the Bones Brigade and to continue to represent and promote skateboarding as a fun and creative pursuit accessible to all . One thing I 'm certain of , this is n't just some retro thing , Powell Peralta will move forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for what it was but for what it is .

And who knows , he 's an adult now , maybe he 's grown up since then ? He sounded a little arrogant in the interview , but , he does sound a little more mature as far as I can tell . <p> I 'm guessing that in the present economy he decided that putting food on the table for his family was more important than trying to make a political statement about the state of corporate skateboarding <p> If that is the case then fair enough , but dressing it up in faux-esoteric talk about things being ' meant to be ' and his DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual self aggrandising garbage that trickles from his mouth . <p> On his firsthand he kept talking about how element changed his life and how he would n't still be skating if it was n't for element signing him .

The first thing that came to mind was that somebody may choose a soft riser because it would protect the board from stress cracks , but on the other hand maybe somebody would choose hard risers because they 're more responsive . But those are just my assumptions , I do n't even know if what I said about hard risers is even true . <p> So I would like to hear your thoughts on it . I use risers but have always used soft . Maybe if I hear some good/interesting thing about hard risers then I 'll give it a try . I could always just switch back . <p> I always combine em ; I got a 1/2 " urethane one ( the hardest in urethane , but its still softer than plastic ) , and a thin one in hard plastic , making the whole thing 13mm thick . its the perfect marriage imo . <p> Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you need to not get wheel bite ( when you are landing tricks and what not ) the pressure you are putting on the risers will compress them and boom wheel bite . <p> Forgive me , I heard so many dumb things in skateboarding lately , I 'm not even surprised what some people might actually think . <p> For real though , you are 13 , and probably ride street , so you wo n't need anything over 1/8 " , most likely . What size wheels do you roll on ? <p> Right now I 'm using a 1/8 soft riser on LO Trucks . I usually use like 53-55mm , but my current wheels are around 43mm because of all the powerslides I do so I 've been experiencing zero bite for quite awhile now . But I still use the riser because I like the added comfort and height it gives me . It just feels right .

Hit a pebble in a big bowl yesterday and got a pretty gnarly flat spot . <p> Anyways , for about the past 4 years or so I 've been using some genaric type wheels . TGM Skateboarding 54mm wheels . They are much more affordable , each pair would last me a long time , and I 've never really had a problem with them . According to TGM they are just as good of quality as all the pro brands , just without the expensive advertising . <p> Basically although I 've always been happy with them , and like the price . But if there really is a wheel out there that is dramatically better , I 'd pay the bit extra for it . <p> I 've been hearing good things about these bones spf wheels , but I 'm wondering if its all hype ? I 've heard a few people saying they are " the fastest wheel they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their head since its a new wheel and they think its good . <p> My skating is 95% in skateparks , I skate concrete , skatelite , masonite , wood , and even some metal ramps .

So i want a wheel that can maintain speed with minimum effort ( I use bones reds bearings and am happy with them ) . Could the spf wheels actually be better in any way than my genaric ones ? <p> One thing that makes me wonder about these wheels also is people claiming that they are both " grippy " , and " slide easily " . That does n't make any sense , how can they be both ? If they slide easily that means they are not grippy , and vice versa . I really do n't think I want a wheel that slides too much because I hate slipping out .

What are you guys 's opinions ? <p> I bought 60mm spf last week for the first time ; I 've always ridden old bones up till now ( ratbones , g-bones , two-rats , mini-rats , etc ) &amp; I must say my speed has improved drastically . I only skate pool so I was kinda sceptic bout em , coz I want wheels that have a good grip at all times . I was surprised at how little efford it cost me to cruise round . so + speed &amp; good grip imo ; also when I want to do a powerslide in the tranny , or a bert , its really no efford . I du n no what they 're made of , but it def not the oldschool urethane I 'm used to , but hell they 're great wheels imo . <p> Thanks for the input so far . 2 more people just mentioned that the spf wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone explain that , because it does n't make sence . <p> If they have good grip , that should make it more difficult to slide , since they are gripping so well . And if a wheel slides easily , that should mean it does n't have as good of grip . How can it be both ? Makes me worry I might start slipping and powersliding when I do n't want to . <p> And can anyone explain why they are so much faster ? How can one type of wheel be significantly faster than the other , if they are the same size , similar hardness , and the same bearings are used ? Is it possible that its just a mind trick ? I mean I 'm assuming the majority of people that try them , usually would be replacing old worn out wheels .

( meaning new bones vs new other brand , with brand new bearings of the same brand ? <p> Thanks . <p> Good question . <p> From a purely factual standpoint , softer wheels are harder to slide with . This is a well-known fact . Ask any longboarder into sliding and they 'll they 'll tell that that soft wheels ( 78A and around there ) are really not much good for extended slides although they work well enough for short , speed-killing berts . This is because soft wheels grip better and hence are not so easy to slide with . <p> Harder wheels are easier to slide with . <p> As for speed , this is affected by a number of things . The main factors I 've experience however are:L <p> Bearings <p> Size of wheels <p> Length of wheelbase <p> Terrain <p> Let me explain the above in more details . <p> First , bearings : These make some difference , but mostly if you 're going from skating awful , cheap , crap made-in-china ABEC1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning and lubrication I have not noticed any real speed difference between the following bearings : <p> Rush ABEC-7 <p> Rush Bombers <p> Speedy Lunatic ABEC-5 <p> Bones China Reds <p> Secondly , size of wheels : These make a big difference . Recently I switched from skating worn 52mm street wheels on my street setup to skating 68mm longboard wheels on my street setup . The difference in terms of maximum speed and sustained speed was tremendous . <p> Thirdly , length of wheel-base : Generally speaking , a longer wheelbase means that your board will be able to attain higher top speeds and maintain them without speed wobbles . However , this is not a simple linear scaling and ties in closely with the next factor . <p> Fourth , terrain : On flat terrain , you need to push more to get going and to stay going . On sloped or hilly terrain , you need to push less often and are able to achieve a higher top speed . <p> How does it all tie together , though . Well , let me illustrate some actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards , a standard street 32 " x 7.5 " deck that I ride with either 52mm 100A wheels or 68mm 78A wheels and a cruiser longboard that measures 42 " x 9.75 " that I ride with 68mm 78A wheels . I ride both boards with same sets of bearings ( Rush Abec7s , Rush Bombers , Speed Lunatic Abec5s , Bones China Reds ) . <p> What I 've found is as follows . <p> The longboard performs roughly the same with regards to speed regardless of which bearings I use in it . Also , the longboard is capable of higher speeds on real ramps , slopes and hills . However , on flat terrain the longboard is not as fast because of its greatly increased mass which makes it harder to push and pump on flats . <p> The shortboard , equipped with 52mm wheels , performs at roughly the same speed regardless of bearings . However , there is a more noticeable , albeit still slight , difference between the different types of bearings with regards to speed . Out of my setups this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of the least tight turns . <p> Finally , the shortboard equipped with 68mm wheels is the fastest setup I 've ridden on flat and lightly sloped terrain . On flat ground , the combination of a light deck , well lubricated bearings and big wheels allows for me to reach high top speeds ( Faster than the longboard on the same terrain ) and maintain them ( I have to push least often of all with this combo on flat ground ) with ease . Additionally , the ride is smooth and I can turn quite tightly ( Although not as tightly as the longboard , which carvers sharper turns than anything else I ride thanks to the special Carver trucks ) . <p> So , as you can see , there is a lot of variance in terms of performance but probably the biggest difference you can make with a short board is to go for larger wheels if you 're looking for speed . <p> If you want to maintain a that hard , street feel then you 'll want to look for large wheels with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a set of those too thinking I was coming up on an amazing deal , flatspotted within a month .

I 'd like to hear more as to why you did n't like them . If they are " ridiculously hard " , does that mean they do n't have enough grip , or what ? <p> I had been thinking about the better skateboard wheels , but one thing raised a big red flag for me . If you go to youtube and type in something along the lines of " skateboard wheel review " , tons and tons of reviews pop up for better skateboard wheels , probably at least 100 , I never got through them all . From what I 've watched they are all positive . Try to look up any other wheel reviews , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company must be either paying , or in some way compensating all these people to do good reviews of their product .

Has anyone else used durarollers and have an opinion on them ? <p> Like I said before , I 've been pretty happy with them , but then I 'm not nearly as hardcore of a skater ( yet ) as alot of people , so maybe I just do n't know any better . That 's why I 'm trying to figure out if there indeed is anything better worth considering . <p> It really makes me think that the company must be either paying , or in some way compensating all these people to do good reviews of their product . Why would a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so many reviews , unless they are possibly trying to compensate for any bad ones . <p> they send a letter with each set saying that if you review them they 'll send you a free set . i 've lost the letter but it really seems to imply that if you give them a good review you get another set . <p> the hardness thing means that they 're just too hard , they feel really rough on anything but super smooth cement . and mine flatspotted really bad in about a month . i think that the formula they use slides really well and that 's about it . the whole brand is based on hype and bribed reviews . <p> The last man on earth was sitting in his living room when he heard a knock at the door ... <p> the hardness thing means that they 're just too hard , they feel really rough on anything but super smooth cement . <p> I disagree with that , I probably skate on rougher terrains than most people on this website do , and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I personally find that when you 're just cruising around they feel just like normal hard wheels do , the only thing it really comes down to whether or not you like how hard wheels feel , you have to expect that ' roughness ' on rough grounds you 're describing from pretty much any wheel that 's over 99A . <p> And your last comment is a ridiculous assumption as well , I know a LOT of people who love Better wheels for what they are and are n't even aware of the hype they get online ( provided that you can call it a ' hype ' because they are n't even really popular ) , the only reason why this ' hype ' exists to begin with is because the company could n't think of anything to get their name out there when they first started out with pretty much no money so they invited random people to review them . I ca n't say anything about how they encouraged people to be positive about them though , since I never made a review them myself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just happened to love the wheels I asked to try out before accepting their sponsorship over , so I said yes ( if the wheels had sucked I would have declined it , it 's not even a matter of getting free gear for me since I get everything I want for free at my shop ) <p> They do flatspot though , but not earlier than any other brand of wheel I 've got to try , and I do lots of reverts , lipslides and wallrides , so idk . I understand that it 's just your opinion you 're bringing up , but maybe you just had a bad set somehow or something <p> PS - I just noticed the link in your sig , you 're a freestyler right ? AFAIK freestylers generally do n't really put wheels to the same use as other skaters do , maybe it has more to do with the way you personally skate than the quality of the wheels itself <p> Honestly , IMO , wheels are basically wheels . I have a set of bones wheels and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like really hard wheels , and the rictas treat me fine . but the truth of the matter is , buy a set of the bones , and if you do n't like them , go back to generics . <p> I have a pair of Spitfire Trujillo Parkburners , the 58mm conical wheels ... they are pretty sick . Just a little bit of softness to them , and a lot of riding area ... they still slide really good and are pretty fast for a pool/vert wheel . I always stick with bone white Spit 's no matter what . <p> i guess i should clarify on the hardness more . they werent just hard they were hard and chalky . they did n't  feel as much like a regular urethane wheel to me . <p> of all the wheels i 've used i flat spotted 3 sets . them being one of them . so naturally i did n't  like them that much . <p> Originally Posted by MRCK <p> PS - I just noticed the link in your sig , you 're a freestyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same use as other skaters do , maybe it has more to do with the way you personally skate than the quality of the wheels itself <p> Alright , thanks for clarifying . That 's an interesting opinion to hear since I had never heard anything bad about Better wheels before - only good feedback from people who had liked them . Now I have a better perspective when it comes to possible reasons why someone could dislike them .

Gil 's still scheduled to appear here and there in the future , but he 's now more focusing on directing the show . <p> Yeah , I mean when you watch the last half of the past season , it all leads up to their relationship .

Of course not the same without Gil , but Fishbourne adds a new element to the shows .

It 's a problem with a trucks/bushings , but I ca n't figure out how to fix it . I 'm riding new trucks and bushings now , and I got extra hard bushings to make sure I did n't bend them . This time I bent the metal plate above the bushing , which is now leaning to the side . <p> This is driving me f*king crazy , so if someone can she 'd some light on the situation , please do ! <p> yeah that happens to me too its because your weight tends to go to one side as it does for everbody .... the only thing that i have found to work is to keep buying bushing and loosen your trucks more it sucks because i like my trucks really tight and its hard to ride with them loose but only thing that i have found too work ... or you can ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans the other way and your body evens it out ? if you find a answer better though let me know <p> This happens to me from time to time and it 's a problem I only have on freestyle setups .

I was truly astounded by the quality of the Bullet trucks I put on my latest freestyle board . especially when compared to the Indy Stage IX 's on my old board .

I loosened them up a bit and that did help a lot .

Once you have pop shuvs nollie shuvs are n't  hard at all , and you will feel good to be able to do a nollie trick . Also try 180s , and maybe even varials once pop shuvs are down , my friend learned varial heels as his first flip trick , and he thought fs shuvs were easier than bs shuvs .

You 'll have to put a lot more force to pop with bigger wheels in the back than you would normally . Do n't do it . <p> By the same principle you could just pop using the nose instead of the tail and save yourself getting different sized wheels and then finding out that it does n't work , and if you think it does you 're only fooled by the placebo effect .

@@108987726 @4387726/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <h> 24 Skateboards deck review <p> I was initially drawn to this company for it 's low price point , Australian made and a one year free replacement warranty on snaps . <p> The deck cost $45 ( AUD ) with their own brand of griptape which is cheap in comparison to the local skateshop where you can pay upwards of a $100 for a pro model . After ordering online the it arrived 4 days later with the best griptape job I 've seen from an online retailer ( previously purchased decks from skatewarehouse and ccs ) . <p> First impressions : As I said previously I was pleasantly surprised with the griptape job apart from a small air-bubble near the front bolts . The board felt better crafted than my old girl deck and slightly lighter . The shape differed also , offering more concave and a nice full tail which I have come to prefer . The griptape is a lot less " grippy " than the mob on my previous deck . The graphic seemed reasonably rich in colour but by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from skating . <p> Performance : Light , fantastic pop with a great shape but the griptape wears off really easily and is not as grippy as I 'd like it to be . The deck is constructed beautifully and is able to take a ****ing belting without chipping , denting or having any of the layers splitting apart ( a problem that my old deck suffered from ) . That being said , however , I am pretty new to skateboarding and ca n't put it through the paces of someone more experienced . <p> In conclusion , if you 're an Aussie and you need a new deck there 's no reason not to try one of these boards . I found it better than most of the shop boards and blanks I 've ridden and the free replacement warranty would be fantastic for those of you that break decks a lot . My only disappointment is in the durability and grip of the griptape but after riding mob for so long I 'm probably just spoiled . <p> I won a board from their site , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 months of having it so far and its still good . Its lost a bit if pop but I 've left it in my car through the summer and winter so that was expected . Plus the one year no-snap warranty , its awesome . It cost em $44 to ship , and they paid it all . Tempted to pay the 90 for the board if mine breaks . Recommend em <p> They sound pretty decent I will have to check them out . I agree with kk360 . It does n't sound like they would make much of a profit but I 'm sure they have some type of plan seeing as though they reached out to some of our regulars . Thanks for the review Robsta.

All other posts asking questions or challenging the debunk posts will be deleted . If you would like to ask a question or challenge any of the information please private message the person that created the post . The reasoning is I 'd like this to be a clear , concise , and easy to read through thread free of hundreds of posts between debunk posts . <p> Skateboarding myths : <p> 1 . Large decks are n't good for street , only vert . They also flip slow . <p> Decks come in different sizes because people come in different sizes and weights . Deck sizes should generally be chosen by feel and comfortability . If you feel your knees are too close together thereby offsetting your balance you will need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deck feels overwhelmingly large you will need a shorter narrower deck . It 's best to choose one that feels like the perfect balance between stability on the board and enough width for comfortable foot placement . If you have large feet and get too narrow of a deck it 's likely to pose problems with stability and trick execution . A shorter person having smaller feet will have a harder time controlling a deck that 's too large or wide . It 's often said that large decks flip really slow . A smaller person , let 's say a kid age 10 , kickflips a 7.5 " x 31.25 " deck . Then you take an adult , say age 29 , kickflipping an 8 " x 32 " deck . Both flips should appear extremely similar without a noticeable difference in flip speed . You can observe this in skate videos . The reason is a full grown adult will have more strength and power in their flip thereby moving the extra weight with ease . Now , of course if that same adult kickflips a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same power is moving a smaller object . But either way , the flip speed of a large deck is by no means slow when done by a person of proper proportion to the board . Yes , of course young kids will flip large boards slower but it does n't mean this is correct for everyone . <p> 2 . Larger wheels , say 56-58mm , are n't good for street , only vert . <p> This is a bit of a miscontrustrued idea . The theories vary from the wheels being too heavy to the center of gravity of the board is offset too much . While the center of gravity may change it 's by an extremely tiny amount , not enough to truly make any different unless you 're using huge wheels and have added very thick risers . It really just comes down to the person and personal feel . The difference in weight between wheels that are 50mm and 56mm are quite small . In the Oldschool days people were kickflipping non-uniform 10 " wide decks with 10 " wide trucks with huge 64mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays a role but when working with a heavier object you eventually adjust to it and gain the extra strength . Larger wheels are beneficial in two ways . First , they let you roll faster . Second , they raise your board a little higher off the ground thereby increasing the tail angle which gives an added benefit , though very slight , to Ollie height . So all in all things usually balance out . Like I mentioned , it 's all personal feel . If you like your trucks really loose and do n't like using risers ( raising the deck higher from the ground ) then smaller wheels should be your choice . If you like a faster , smoother ride , you should consider wheels that are a little larger . It does n't mean you wo n't be able to skate street anymore <p> 3 . The lighter the board the higher you can ollie . <p> This comes from what would appear to be common sense . Obviously you can lift something lighter higher than something heavy right ? Well , not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ollie is an action-&gt;reaction . You pop and the board comes up and toward you . Then you slide your foot up creating the opposite resistance and upward drag , etc . Having a slightly bolder weight at the front of the board ( front truck ) provides more backward push against your foot sliding up thereby allowing your shoe to grip the board more firmly and take it up into the air . A slightly bolder weight also gives more stability against the powerful motions of your feet . Of course , too heavy would be completely counter productive but in all honesty the weight of the " heavier " setups out there are only a tiny , pretty much imperceivable , amount heavier than the " lighter " setups . Obviously there will always be those swearing up and down they can ollie a lot higher now that they got the lighter deck and trucks etc . But there is such a thing called the Placebo Effect . A board weighing 3 ounces lighter will not make you ollie a foot higher . In other words , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're xx years old you 're too old to start skating . <p> Age is something that affects everyone differently . You will find people that are obese with health problems at the age of 14 . Should someone like this take up skating ? Probably not . Should the 40 year old couch potato that 's 260lbs and has n't exercised in 10 years try to suddenly get into skating ? Again , probably not . But what about those still fit and active ? Why the heck not ? If you 're 50 and still in shape and do n't have joint problems and all that and want to try skateboarding go right ahead ! A number of professional skaters are in their 30 's . Rodney Mullen is now 40 . Danny Way is 32 ( and still setting world records ) , Tony Hawk is 38 . They 're still skating . Why ? Cause they 're immune to aging ? No , but as I said everyone ages differently . And these guys are examples of people that kept fit and can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of a number of people in the olympics , look at Lance Armstrong . So when it 's asked , " Am I too old ? " the response should be , " Age means nothing , but what physical shape are you in ? " . Lastly , skating does n't have to be popping nollie kickflip boardslides down a 15 set . Some people are content with riding around , or doing simpler tricks , things that are still fun and much less taxing to a not so young and fit body . <p> 5 . Freezing skateboard wheels makes them last longer . <p> With certain metals , freezing at cryonic temperatures ( -320 degress for example ) re-alligns the molecular structure thereby eliminating molecular gaps - in other words it creates a tighter structure . A company called Dean Markley applies this technology to a line of guitar strings they make called Blue Steel . Skateboard wheels however are urethane so this does n't apply . Nonetheless , your common household refrigerator comes nowhere near even being close to cryogenic temperatures so freezing your wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has no benefitial effect on the wheels whatsoever . People will claim they can tell a difference but again that 's the placebo effect . For more reading on cryogenics and their application you can check this link out : http : **36;385;TOOLONG <p> 6 . Blank Decks are n't as good as pro decks : <p> This is both true and false - mainly false . Most blank decks are actually made in the same factories as pro decks and are made with the same shape templates as pro decks . As a matter of fact , most pro decks are made from already designed templates from the deck manufacturers . Companies can get samples to see which template shapes they like best and then they provide the artwork to go on the deck . Deck manufacturer Watson Laminates has made decks for companies such as Pig Wood , Zero , Foundation , Sector 9 , Element , Toy Machine , and many others . So has California Skate Factory ( Alien Workshop among others ) . These same companies will make decks for pretty much anyone that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually 500 - 1000 ) . They get cheaper the more you order . A good number of blank decks come from the same companies so you 'd be surprised to learn that your blank may be of the exact same quality as a pro deck simply without the graphics . <p> On the other hand , some blanks , and maybe even some " pro " decks , may be made by a manufacturer of lesser expertise ( ie. cheaper cost ) . On that account the one problem is how do you know which is which when they 're just blanks with no info on them ? Well , unless the place selling the blanks indicates where they were made you really ca n't tell otherwise . But when it comes down to it you have to understand that what primarily , though not solely , makes a pro deck cost more is the advertising , graphic printing , and the pro skaters whose names are on the decks they have to pay . Advanced construction technologies , such as carbon fiber inserts , varying laminate thicknesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - sometimes as much as $7 per deck more ! But put plainly , with blanks costing approximately in the neighborhood of $20 each and pro decks approximately $50 each I honestly ca n't say the length a pro deck will outlast two blanks . The pluses of buying a pro deck however are in the support you give to the pro skater whose name is on the deck as well as supporting the company , getting special construction , and at the same time maybe getting a graphic you really identify with . Either way , whichever you buy you 're still supporting skating and helping to keep people employed ; - ) Here 's a link to read some interesting info about Watson Laminates : <p> In fact loosening your trucks will get rid of speed wobbles .

This is not true at all , I find that once i 've ridden a deck for a few weeks I skate it better than when I first got it as it 's more worn in . Also brands do n't norally make much of a difference in how long they last either . I bought two chocolate skateboard decks , a baker deck and have had 3 kewday 's a ; ll which have lasted no longer than a month . Then I bought almost 7 blank decks which lasted me the exact same amount of time sometimes longer , and the price was almost half . Then I bought even cheaper ' Moose Blanks ' of eBay and each deck has lasted me almost three months ! That 's almost quarter of the price of a brand deck and they last three times as long , and I have been skating harder than I was when I are all meant to shine as children do . It 's not just in some of us ; it is in everyone . And as liberates others . " <p> about larger deck : Pros like Andrew Reynolds ride boards more than 8 " wide , and he s not a very wide guy.about new stuff : really the tail is n't worn down when you get a new one , and its pretty nice hard condition . you may get used to a worn board but the new ones are at a better stage in life . <p> Sliding your tail on the ground before sessioning will wear down the razor tail I do n't  know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide there tail across the ground to " where down there razor tail " really , I do n't  know how you can do this on a skatepark ground , and it wo n't make your deck more square .

If you where to use it on ashpalt and recreate the perfect tail angle then this is good . really it does nothing . <p> taking out two peices of hardware off each end will make your board lighter this may be lighter , but not that much ... if you hold 4 peices of hardware in your hand its not that heavy .

If it 's not grinding , push harder and lean back a bit when you land on it to prevent dig . If you get into the bad habit of just relying on wax , you 'll make certain things a lot more dangerous than they ever should be . <p> i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then leaning back further with mroe speed and stuff . did n't  get close . then i waxed it some more and got it fine . <p> i 've also found this un-true. i 've tried barely waxing stuff , then leaning back further with mroe speed and stuff . did n't  get close . then i waxed it some more and got it fine . <p> Then you 're simply not going at it right . <p> The point is you can grind any obstacle if you 're just sliding on wax , but you do n't need the wax . You should always be able to feel some resistance to the grind ; many pool/ditch skaters do n't even bother with wax . Also , relying on over-waxing is not only dangerous ( both to yourself and to others ) , but will only negatively affect your skating over time . Think about it ; would you rather be able to just skate the streets properly , in long fluent lines , grinding any curb you find , or would you rather have to spend your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads can break your landing when ollieing off of stuff the riser pads do n't  do that much , if you buy foam over rubber ones ... they do n't  make a difference when you land . the difference is that you can fit bigger wheels with low trucks , it can reduce wheel bite if you drop off of stuff , and reduces pressure cracks alot coming from the trucks out . <p> i use shock pads spicificly so my board does not presure crack . once i had a new board with no presure cracks in it or shock pads and i ollied a 4 and landed and my tail snaped off <p> once i had a new board with no presure cracks in it or shock pads and i ollied a 4 and landed and my tail snaped off <p> Then you did n't land cleanly enough . That 's the classic deck snap ; landing with your back foot too far back will take the tail clean off . Some decks are more resilient to it than others , but not landing on the bolts is always a bad move .

Not Heelies , not rollerblades or skates , but they looked like skateboard wheels , a single wheel on in the middle of each shoe . He was moving in a weird way , his body sideways like if he was riding a skateboard , but his feet were moving forward and back ( it looked like he was " walking " but moving sideways ) , and that seemed to be propelling him . <p> I thought this was really cool , and was wondering if you would know what those are .

Filmers also need softer wheels so that they do n't bail over rocks while filming . <p> having soft wheels that are small makes no sense .... usually if you get soft wheels is means you want to skate rougher terrain , small wheels get stuck on pebbles and **** easier , so if you want a smoother ride big wheels are the way to go because they roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes no sense , they go slower , wear down faster and get caught on pebbles easier . why would anyone want small wheels ? ! <p> Some people like the feeling of small wheels , and the feeling of soft wheels .

I knew I liked an aspect of skating , but only recently did I realize it was that smooth , soulful cruising feeling of riding around . <p> For this reason , I want to get in to longboarding . I am looking for a decent board to get started ( nothing crappy or super fancy ) . In terms of riding style , I see myself just cruising around ( no huge hills or speed demon stuff ) . However , I want to get over my fear of bombing hills , so I may eventually bomb some small hills with this board . <p> What are your suggestions ? I would be looking for something under or around US $150 that would give me a clean , smooth , but not too fast ( I want control ) ride . <p> I was looking at the original boards website and I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruising or surfing/flatland ? ( those are their categories ) <p> i 'd actually stay away from original if i were you . i do n't really like them , i find they 're kinda weird to push on because the trucks are so turny , and they 're basically one-trick ponies ; for carving and carving only ... i 've heard a lot of people frustrated with originals as their first boards . <p> i know the sector9 cosmic series is pretty popular because they 're very widely available and they have a similar feel to a regualr skateboard . many earthwing boards , like i mentioned in an earlier post , are designed around indys , so they feel very good on indy-style trucks . also , the supergliders feel quite similar to a shortboard . <p> First , Rockstar is right , stay away from original as a first board setup . Their trucks are spring based which makes them able to carve very sharp lines but it will be very difficult and strange for a begginer . Not to mention that their boards are over priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered that word ) wood and not bamboo or fibreglass ( Some of them have a layer or two but nothing significant ) . <p> As for wheels ... If you are wanting to get into DH just a little but you are scared ... Definately soft . If you are afraid of high speeds than you will want soft wheels because they will move slower as well as grip better if you do get some speed so you will be a little more confident about not sliding out of control . If you want to go slow go for smaller wheels . Do n't get 75mm + wheels if you are that afraid of speed . So I would recommend 72 to 78a wheels in 70 to 72 mm . <p> For a deck ... If you do n't want to spend over $150 than I can only point you to two larger brands ... Sector 9 is a popular choice and their boards are cheap ... they are good starter boards but you will want to upgrade eventually . Kracked Skulls is another option ... they preform like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is so I 'll just say it is a really good board ) and they only cost $70 for a deck . PM me if you are gon na get one and I can get you a discount . And you also might want to check out creigslist or ebay to see what is out there for cheap . Oh , and Never Summer has some good stuff also , just slightly more expensive .

I can just as well say that the tail should be bigger because of tailslides . It 's because fakie/nollie tricks are harder to pop and so you 'll need a larger and steeper end . I myself do n't care at all about the ends . Actually , I do n't want to even care because I do n't ride fakie/nollie as much as regular/switch , and that means that one end would wear out faster , which makes regular/switch tricks harder after a trick that changes the ends ( e.g. a shove-it ) <p> blahblah9 <p> 01-23-2009 , 05:33 PM <p> well i 'm still confused LOL i have a end i have dedicated as tail , both my front and back are the same width , but if i take and measure the end of the board to the first screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end measurs about 6 1/4 " so i take it the 6 1/2 is the nose and 6 1/4 is the tail ?

@@108987775 @4387775/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <h> How do you manage to absorb impact on landings ? <p> I 'm wondering how you guys do to absorb the impact from landing a gap or a set . <p> Obviously you bend your knees , but it seems as if i 'm doing something wrong . After a big gap , if I do n't bend my knees like a mother****er , there 's a pretty good chance I break my board . Even if I bend my knees a little on landing , my board still breaks sometimes . Even fairly new ones . I almost always land bolts when I try a trick off a set or gap , but the few times I do n't , my board snaps , or at least cracks big time . <p> I only weigh 130 so its kinda weird to me , and I do n't skate cheap decks . <p> So basically i 'm just wondering how you guys cope with absorbing impact , if you do n't bend your knees alotttt on a landing ( like sheckler does ) then how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  really think about it i just kinda do it but i guess its like you just bend your knees your ankles and everything so your not landing stiff at all . Also if you land bolts its almost impossible to break your board . Only times ive broken/crack boards are when i landed a kickflip off center off a 5 1/2 foot dock and i only cracked it . And i broke a board bomb dropping off this really high thing cause i landed the tiniest bit off bolts . <p> I believe I can offer some actual advice here , even though I 've never ollied a single gap or set of stairs , so you may want to take this all with a pinch of salt ( And feel free to call me on talking **** of that 's what I 'm doing ; - ) ) <p> Watch episode 4 of the TV series Time Warp . In that episode the Time Warp crew do a spot on Greg Lutzka and catch some high-quality , ultra-slow motion footage of him doing 180s , 360 kickflips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stairs ( It was a 4 or 5 set I think ... ) <p> Anyway , the slow motion footage of him landing the stair set shows : <p> Knee bending , as others have mentioned <p> Bounce <p> The second part is the interesting bit . From the footage they caught Greg landed on the board , then bounced up off it a few centimeters before landing on the board again . <p> This is sure to absorb impact by re-directing it . You can try it your self . Try jumping off a small wall and bending your knees on landing and then bouncing out of the landing in a small jump or series of jumps . Compare it to jumping of the wall and just landing with your knees bent . You 'll notice that the extra bounces method makes the landing a lot less forceful . <p> I use this trick a lot when I bail on something ( Which happens very often ) because it greatly reduces the impact of a high-speed landing . <p> Now , I 'm guessing that applying this trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , I think it 's worth a go . But maybe practise with a helmet ; - ) <p> Do not think that the knowledge you presently possess is changeless , absolute truth . Avoid being narrow-minded and bound to present views . Learn and practice non-attachment from views in order to be open to receive others viewpoints . Truth is found in life and not merely in conceptual knowledge . Be ready to learn throughout your entire life and to observe reality in yourself and in the world at all times . <p> It does n't matter how big or small the gap is if you land wrong on your board there is always the chance it will snap . <p> From my experience a new board is always more prone to snap so if you wear it in a bit before skating gaps/stairs your board will be better off . <p> As you already know bending your knee 's is the best thing you can do . If your already doing that and your landing bolts it 's pretty hard to snap your board . Also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your doing something other than a ollie catching the board will take away a little impact when you land . For example if you Kickflip a 7 set and you do n't catch your board there the force on your board will be much more than if you caught it . <p> Thanks guys , I skate pretty fast , and the size of the things i 'm talking about is n't too big .. just bigger than i 'm used to . Maybe a 5 foot gap , or a 6 set . I always catch my kickflips off things , but i 'm not putting anyone 's suggestions down . I do the back leg bend thing , I 've been trying to stop since I do n't think it looks nice , but whatever if it helps then i 'll do it . <p> Guess I do n't have many options . I 'll just stick to bending my knee 's like crazy , like my ass almost touches the ground haha . If I do n't , it 'll probably break . Once again thanks guys .

I got some $120 ones and it turns out they were just trendy party jeans no good for skating . <p> Berishman <p> 11-01-2009 , 01:33 AM <p> I 've noticed that jeans with spandex rip in the crotch a lot sooner than jeans without spandex . <p> Vrait <p> 11-01-2009 , 08:10 AM <p> I never rip pants anymore , but use to at the knees a lot . <p> soupey <p> 11-01-2009 , 08:35 AM <p> Knees for sure . <p> - BigRob - <p> 11-01-2009 , 11:53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the arse seams =/ <p> Vit <p> 11-02-2009 , 07:15 PM <p> The left side of my jeans rips a lot because I carry my board with my left hand and even though you do n't actually feel it rubbing back n ' forth , it builds up and after a month , you got some badass holes and people can see whatcha got in da pants .

Us , street credit ? we 're the single most hated subculture in the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . Value Both a bike and a skateboard are victims to getting stolen . But is n't almost everything in this world ? I guarantee you a bike has more value over a skateboard though . Which means we do n't  have to worry about getting our board jacked as often as all the bikers out there . A scratched up skateboard with flat spotted wheels is n't as attractive as a legit bike . Less stress . Then again , I 've had a deck stolen before , and besides , not many people can sneak a BMX away under their coat . <p> 8 . No blisters That 's right we do n't  have to worry about getting those nasty boils or warts that all the bikers get from gripping those bars all the time . Or those horrible shinners ! Have you ever been shinned by a bear claw pedal from a bike ? If not you do n't  want to experience it . Its basically like getting shanked in the leg . Be thankful of your skateboard . Yes we do , from picking up out decks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 7 . Skate shoes Yes they are called skate shoes not " bike shoes " All those brands out there are aimed towards skateboarders first . They tapped into the bike market to make more cash . But reality of it is that the bikers our wearing skate shoes regardless . Then again , any flat-soled shoe 'll do on a bike , tennis shoes , etc ... <p> 6 . Maintenance For one we do n't  have to fix a chain or air up them wheels . I hate pumping air into a tire . Its irritating and getting a flat is even more irritating . The entire process of fixing a bike tire is strenuous compared to adjusting a skate wheel . Skateboarding definitely wins when it comes to fixing up your goods quicker . I 've never seen a BMX snap in half before ... <p> 5 . Carry your bike ? I think not . Hell we got backpacks with skate straps on them . We can go basically anywhere with our skateboard .

That giant hunk of metal bars and pipes is going to come right back and hit you or worse you 'll get stuck with it . Its asking for double trouble when you are already going to eat **** from trying a trick .

Which means we do n't  have to worry about getting our board jacked as often as all the bikers out there . A scratched up skateboard with flat spotted wheels is n't as attractive as a legit bike .

Also that bike may be $500 but other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do on your bike and it will still last a zillion times longer than a skateboard . They actually have resale value too . <p> 8 . No blisters This is also under the category that bmx injuries are normally more painful ( not the blisters just crashes in general ) As for blisters ... Does anyone here play guitar ? For the first cople of months you get blisters on your hands everytime you play and then it gradually stops . Yeah holding handlebars is the same way . <p> 7 . Skate shoes Do I even need to mention how many pairs of shoes skaters waste in just a year from them ripping the first or second day they are skated with ? <p> 6 . Maintenance For one we do n't  have to fix a chain or air up them wheels . I hate pumping air into a tire . Its irritating and getting a flat is even more irritating . The entire process of fixing a bike tire is strenuous compared to adjusting a skate wheel . Skateboarding definitely wins when it comes to fixing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half . If it does it was probably a bad bike or else a dud in the production line . Honestly though ... Skateboards are much more maintenence . Bikes you pump the tires and your good for a long time . Most skateboarders find themselves replacing boards atleast monthly . <p> 5 . Carry your bike ? I think not . Hell we got backpacks with skate straps on them . We can go basically anywhere with our skateboard . In stores , malls , schools , subways , buses , you name it . Sure you can travel off road on a bike but what the hell would we want to do that for anyways ? Not only are bikes faster ... You can ride them on all types of terrain not only actually making transportation easier but enabling you to have fun while you go <p> 4 . Bailing On a bike you cant really throw it out as easy .

Imagine scorpioning it only to have a bike peg you on the head on top of you already scraping face first on the pavement . Ouch . If your a skater that 's never been owned by a pebble or a crack then I do n't  even know what to say ... Anyways youve yet agian proved bmxing is more dangerous and yes danger=gnar <p> 3 . Pegs ? Grinding objects with pegs decreases its grind span . I have seen countless skatepark coping absolutely ruined by bike pegs . Plus it does n't  even look cool . Floating down a ledge on a skateboard just looks 20 times smoother and better . Which leads me to the next dominating reason . Whether grinds look better on a skateboard or bike is up to the person but really bmx has more than just that . Some of the pros grind handrails on just bolts . Also if you say doing a 180 to backwards double peg grind down a stairset is n't cool then what makes skateboarding so much better ? <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIKEPARKS " .

I know it sounds lame but here me out . Quite some time back I ordered Dooks 1/8 " shock pads and received black rubber shock pads or risers , whatever . Been using them ever since and love ' em cause the make the ride feel even smoother . I 'm setting up a second board and just received my latest order of Dooks shockpads but they 're not the same at all . These are 1/16 " , are brown , and are made of neoprene or some similar soft material and not the harder black rubber . So I looked Dooks up and tons of sites and all I can find is the soft brown shockpads or plastic risers . <p> Anyone know of the ones I 'm talking about ? Someone here must 've had them before . I see Indepent also makes black rubber risers so I 'll probably have to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the ones I got . Again , go easy on me ... I know they 're just risers ! <p> the shock pads are the brown ones that squish down i got some 1/8 black ones from my shop .. <p> Are the black ones you got plastic or hard rubber ? On skateshop websites they list the Dooks risers as plastic . Also , the hard rubber ones I currently have were solid like the shock pads , they did n't have the hole cut out like the risers do in the pics . <p> If you are set on having a solid but soft feeling riser pads , what I always used to do was to buy a sheet of plexiglass at home depot for one or two dollars , and cut them into the appropriate size with wholes drilled and everything . Then I would buy a product called " Plasti-dip " which is basically spray on rubber , and coat each one of the riser pads with it , let it dry and enjoy them . Hope that helps !

I plan on using it on a shortboard I have for cruising mainly . Would you recommend these to me ? The trucks on the board are pretty high so I do n't think wheelbite will be a problem . <p> get the rictas as long as they do n't have those stupid metal cores. the cores have been known to separate from the wheel , and with the set i tried the bearing moved around in the wheel causing one of them to fail ... <p> Yeah , riser pads will take care of the wheel height issue for you .

It is a tad bouncy too . <p> I really do n't know how small I can get in the 78-85A ( or maybe even up to 90A ) range and still get a cushy feel .

My brother has had a ton of experience with DSLR cameras and photography and suggested the Rebel over the D40 . They are both about the same price so that 's fine . If you want to suggest any other camera my budget is less than $400 . So what are the main differences between the Nikon and Canon ? I have read on this website that the Nikon does n't have auto focus . Can someone please explain this to me ? Does the Canon have auto focus ? Which would you prefer to have and why ? If you own either of the cameras can you tell me what you like and what you do n't like . I went to my local circuit city and felt both cameras and they both felt pretty good to me . Oh and also , when I see that some website are selling camera ' bodies " does this mean that all it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cords already ? Please help me pick out the right camera . Thanks . Merry Christmas . <p> D40 does n't have internal autofocus , so you need an a/f lens , like the one that comes with it , to auto focus . I do n't have any experience with the Canon , but I own a D40 and love it ! It 's very simple to use and takes very sharp pictures . You can adjust the setting to do just about anything . I would highly recommend it . <p> Thanks you guys ! I saw some of your pictures , Jake , and the quality is pretty sick . I 've never had a DSLR so I 'm pretty sure either camera will amaze me but like if I really get into photography or just make it like a main hobby which camera would give me like a better starting point ? Are there any main differences between the two ? I was looking a lenses for the NIkon and Canon and the Nikon lenses are really expensive . I am really not sure lol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else wan na share there opinions ? <p> It 's simple : limited by the lack of an internal AF motor or not . This will effect you more than you think when you come around to buying more lenses ... the D40s performance is VERY limited due to its achilles heel of having no internal AF motor . <p> cool ! Hey , anyone wan na explain to me lenses . Like I do n't understand the millimeters and stuff like that . Man I am so excited to get that camera . Not only am I gon na be using it for like me and my friends when we go skate . But I am also hoping to make it one of my main hobbies since I like how the pictures can like convey messages and feelings and since my brother is really into it we can both go places and take some pictures .

@@108987795 @4387795/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <p> I always went with the idea that I wanted to " stomp on the front truck bolts " . If you do that , you 'll fully commit going in but wo n't nose wheelie ( so long as you keep your front foot from drifting forward of the front trucks ) . At its best , your front truck/wheels " pound " the ramp before you even start rolling down the transition . <p> Most important advice though is not to stand on the coping forever thinking about it . Pump the ramp a bunch , keep that feeling in your feet/legs/head , head up top , and pull the trigger before you have time to lose that feeling . <p> Yesterday I tried dropping in for the first time at the local pool/bowl . Tried an 8 foot ( ? ) section ( smallest ) and " hip-planted " every one . After about 10 tries of my back foot slipping off I settled for glaring at the transition with hatred . <p> The drop in looked a lot smaller when I left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in . Here 's hoping for today . <p> It could have a part on how to hang the board over the edge and how to place your back foot and eventually slam your front foot on . Actually , there was no mention of stomping down and that 's the most important part . <p> I tried at this little park nearby which has a small 1/4 ramp . When I placed my board on it and placed my backfoot on the board then the board wanted to roll back from the angle . I think vert might be easier but scary . Well anyway I just did the Manaul to A### and I actually fell pretty hard on my right wrist &amp; backside . I have had a fratured wrist for the last week which has stopped me from skating hard and a back pain so I can bend my back properly . Lucky I had a wrist guard on or I 'm sure I would have boken it .

I plan to get really comfortable at this low height and then move up slowely . <p> I tend to try and be an instructor to kids at skate parks . for some reason they always ask me how to do something . <p> Last night I taught a kid how to drop in . <p> 1 . commit like you said 2 .

I have loosened the trucks to the point where I can barely stay on it , it 's so floppy , but she can still barely get a tilt to the deck . It does n't help that she 's going slow , of course , but would you recommend loosening them even more - or am I going about it the wrong way entirely ? She 's on a regular size deck , not a kids one ( 31.375 x 7.5 I think - Positiv board ) . <p> Well the question is : Is she trying to turn by leaning , or by pushing down on one side of the board ? <p> You kind of have to have faith that the board is going to turn and you are going to stay with it while it 's turning when you turn with the trucks , since you can end up at a 45 degree angle to the ground haha

Whenever I land primo the two wheels which I landed on have to get the nuts loosened because there is barely any movement in the axle . Is that axle slip or just the nuts ? <p> You can tell if you have axle slip by taking off the wheels to see if the axle is n't totally attached to the inside of the truck . <p> Do you skate with loose wheels ? Should n't do that . Should keep wheels ate tight as you can while still having a nice roll when you spin them . <p> I have them just so the nut is the thing that gets the impact because I do n't want the mashrooming **** happening to my axles . Happened to a friend of mine and now he is skating his board without ever taking off his wheels or his bearings and it 's pretty much trash now . <p> And lol I thought that axle slip was when the axles got hammered inside from landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these oldass Thunders I got at a yard sale a while ago . If you get one , just hit the board in rail on the side where needed to fix it . What you described sounds like what I had . <p> Both will help but the metal cylinder that goes in between the two bearings prevents any warpage/pressure on the bearing so you can tighten the axle nut as hard as you can and the bearings still spin good . <p> I used to have the axle slip problem a lot . Usually you just tap the rail of the board on the loose side and it 'll fix it . Believe it or not there was a time when tracker trucks made a truck with a " floating " axle . Worst trucks ever next to z-rollers . <p> Update , it 's gotten worse . I obviously have washers and spacers and now I know it 's axle slip for sure since when I land on one side of the rail the other side is loose and the side I landed on is very tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could be really old thunders since my friend gave them to me and I do know that they are at least 3 years old .

While the shoe goo is still slightly wet you just take the piece of cardboard of and let it dry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole shoes instead of vulcanized . The Gum they use for the sole of vulcanized shoes is normally much softer than the rubber they use for cup sole shoes . <p> I love my Vans , but I definitely get the flat spots in the toes quick , there are some models of shoes that are vulcanized but with rubber soles , I really want to try a pair some day . Maybe the best of both worlds ? <p> Swordfish <p> 04-19-2009 , 01:22 AM <p> what i do is just temporary but i usually just put in an extra sole over the old one it usually feels better <p> natewhoskates <p> 05-16-2009 , 09:35 PM <p> i skate until i get holes then i open the solde and put a few layers of duct tape and it works pretty well . Merging doublepost i have a pair of circa shoes i wear when i skate and my left shoe alwats gets a whole first so what i do istry not to rub my shoe onto griptape when you positioning your foot <p> cptn craig <p> 05-17-2009 , 10:48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> before it sets ... can you not get a knife/ball point pen and mold in a grip pattern ? <p> so when it is set you will bassically have ... well ... a grip pattern ha ? <p> Iv been skating switch a **** load since there 's a huge hole in the bottom of my right shoe . <p> .

( approx $100 ) and you can mod it ( approx $35 ) and it will work pretty good for you . the raynox is a screw on and you will have to get a stepdown ring for it . no big deal . <p> that camera looked like an ok deal . you may be able to find them a hair cheaper ... but i would try to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts

@@108987858 @4387858/ <p> You know what the worst part about this entire sad story I 'm posting up is ? That a guy like Bucky Lasek is a super generous and trusting person , and this may just spoil it a bit for him every time he takes it upon himself to help someone . He will keep helping people , but with this thought in the back of his head for a while . I hope they throw the book at this manipulating woman ! ! <p> The Baltimore Sun Reported : Professional skateboarder Bucky Lasek , holding the camera with his extended arm at left , took this photo last summer at Disneyland in Anaheim , Calif . Behind Lasek is Patrick Leone , the husband of Dina Perouty-Leone , and next to him , at top center , is Perouty-Leone 's son , Josh , by a previous relationship . Continuing clockwise is Jennifer Lasek , holding one of her daughters , and Perouty-Leone , wearing a hat covering her shaved head . Perouty-Leone 's daughter , next to Bucky Lasek , and the Laseks ' other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laseks were treating Perouty-Leone 's family to a visit to California in response to her claim that she was dying of stomach cancer . The Laseks say they found out the claim was bogus while Perouty-Leone and her family were staying at the Laseks ' home in Encinitas , Calif. , and asked them to leave . ( Photo courtesy of Bucky Lasek ) <p> In the beginning , she fooled everyone . <p> When Dina Perouty-Leone began telling friends and acquaintances that she had terminal stomach cancer and that she needed help paying for treatment because she had no health insurance , there was little reason to doubt her word . <p> " She was very kind , sweet and pleasant , " Jennifer Lasek , a former classmate in Dundalk who donated thousands of dollars , recalled on Tuesday . " She kept saying , ' I love you . No one helps me like that . ' " <p> But Lasek and others in Perouty-Leone 's circle were deceived , according to Baltimore County prosecutors , who charged the former real estate agent with four theft counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Lippe said , and had created an " elaborate scheme to obtain money from her friends to fund her lifestyle and not because of an illness . " <p> On Tuesday , Perouty-Leone , 37 , pleaded guilty to a single count of felony theft . A 1990 graduate of Dundalk High School and the mother of two teenagers , she faces a maximum of 15 years in prison . Baltimore County Circuit Judge John G. Turnbull II ordered her jailed until she is sentenced Aug. 31 . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the tearful defendant said as she turned toward Lasek and another woman she admitted deceiving , Jennifer Lynch , and both avoided her gaze . Perouty-Leone , looking tanned , removed her jewelry and handed it to a bailiff before being led from the courtroom . As she left , she looked at her sister , who was crying , and called out , " Take care of my kids . " <p> Lasek and Lynch , each of whom has lost a parent to cancer , estimate that they gave Perouty-Leone about $12,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer were a hoax . " We had suspicions , " Lasek said after Tuesday 's hearing . " We knew something was n't right . " <p> Lasek was not impressed by the defendant 's apology . " I do n't want it , " she said . " She should apologize to the people fighting cancer . " <p> Lynch said much the same : " It was never about the money . I just wanted her to stop hurting others . " <p> Moved by her plight , Lasek and her husband , the nationally ranked skateboarder Bucky Lasek , who was also in court , treated Perouty-Leone and her family to a visit last summer to the Laseks ' home in Encinitas , Calif. , the San Diego Zoo and Disneyland , the latter apparently one of the defendant 's expressed " dying wishes , " according to Lippe . In photographs taken during that trip , Perouty-Leone looks healthy , a baseball hat covering her bald head a result , as it turned out , not of chemotherapy treatments but of a close shave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 , when she wrote a Web posting indicating her solidarity with fellow sufferers . On Oct. 22 that year , on the Susan G. Komen for the Cure site , she wrote , " No one other than us know what we went through to get where we are . We are strong fighters with a new hope for a cure of something so much greater then life itself . " <p> In January , she told reporters that she had perpetrated the cancer scam because her husband , Patrick Leone , also 37 , had abused her and " made " her do it , yet pictures of the family taken in the last few years show a happy group . She filed a domestic-abuse case against her husband earlier this year , but failed to show up in court and the matter was dismissed . <p> Perouty-Leone 's real estate license was revoked in 2007 , and she was convicted in four previous cases in Carroll County . In the most notable example , prosecutors said , she pretended to be a lawyer and defrauded homeowners into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could help them avoid foreclosure . One case netted her $11,500 from a Sykesville woman , prosecutors said . Perouty-Leone also was charged with repeatedly writing checks on empty or closed accounts , on one occasion for $297 , to her daughter 's school . <p> In the Sykesville case , a judge imposed a sentence of 10 years , suspending all but the 49 days Perouty-Leone had already spent in jail , and placed her on probation until May 2012 . Her guilty plea Tuesday in the Baltimore County case automatically triggers a parole violation in Carroll County , which means that in addition to any new jail term she could be ordered to serve what is left of her 10-year sentence there . <p> Also in court Tuesday was Vicky Squires , another former friend of the defendant and a cancer survivor . She said her own struggle with the disease initially made her empathetic . Squires said she was stunned when Perouty-Leone 's claims turned out to be lies . <p> " I do n't know if any punishment is strong enough for what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought someone could lie like that . Lying to your own kids , telling them you have cancer that 's horrible <p> Snowjoe <p> 06-21-2010 , 03:54 PM <p> They should demolish the woman , she is not fit to lace Laseks shoes .

It 's good that she was caught and is being punished , but I imagine there 's a greater psychological disorder at work .

@@108987859 @4387859/ <p> With the talk about the prices of CB deck in my last thread John was telling me about the prices of decks . Madrid , the manufacturer , while having a great quality of wood has gone up in price so on the next batch of CB decks John is considering possibly going with a lesser quality of wood but it would cut prices of the decks significantly . John is interested in feedback so what do you guys think ? More expensive but better quality wood or less expensive but but not as good quality ? <p> Zak Kimball <p> 07-23-2008 , 10:15 PM <p> better quality wood would be better . unless the price will double or something ... how soon is he planning on changing the price ? <p> Neo IZK <p> 07-23-2008 , 10:16 PM <p> Well it depends .

It 's possible that the people will hardly tell the difference yet get a nice price drop , but it 's also possible that the wood could really suck and people wo n't like the decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM <p> I 'd rather better quality , as long as price does n't get raised insanely high . So I guess it just depends on how much higher the price would get . <p> johnny16tx <p> 07-23-2008 , 10:19 PM <p> i made boards last about a month when i fs 'd alot but my cb3 full color lasted like my last 3months of fs and its still in great shape <p> quality over price for sure <p> mainefreestyle <p> 07-23-2008 , 10:24 PM <p> This will sound bad , but I would like Less quality wood for a cheaper price ......

Chaos Bros. in my opinion has the best quality wood but as I said Madrid the manufacturer of it has raised it 's prices while John has kept the CB decks at the same price as they always have been rather than raising his a Madrid 's went up . Also think of it this way too , you guys are getting asked what you think you would like better rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , I emailed John about the questions you guys have and I 'll get the answers to you as soon as I get an email back from John . <p> girlsk8r <p> 07-23-2008 , 11:03 PM <p> Cheap decks that do n't last long is n't the reputation I 'd want . <p> Appealing to the " I do n't have much money to spend " market segment does n't seem like the best game plan . Someone serious about FS is willing to save their lawn-mowing money and buy something good . <p> yes but at the same time you have to think of it from a business standpoint too . While quality is often better , people still have to buy it for him to run CB successfully . Freestlye is already such a small community to where even if the serious freestylers buy CB decks that 's not really that many people . So it may be smarter for him from a business aspect to lower the price even if it means a slightly lower quality wood so that more people will buy/be able to afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get like the crappiest wood out there or anything either . Just a little lower quality than what it 's at now . I can just see both sides , and I guess it just really depends on how much more it 's going to be . <p> Neo IZK <p> 07-23-2008 , 11:08 PM <p> I assure you it 's not like it 's going to become walmart quality skateboards or something like that . <p> It all depends . I 'm currently riding a cb2 ... if it lasts me a really long time as it is then I 'd be willing to pay a slightly higher price to keep the same quality . However , I destroy most boards in about a month . If the cb2 lasts me about a month , then I 'd rather have it be cheaper . <p> dark-lion <p> 07-23-2008 , 11:48 PM <p> depends on how much more we are talking and how much better the quality would be . Also for freestylers who want affordable decks just go to small school and get blanks if money is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with better quality as long as the price is n't that huge like if its only 5$-$15 diff then i would go with quality . <p> arling777 <p> 07-23-2008 , 11:56 PM <p> I did n't answer the poll . I 'm really starting to consider just starting to skate flat tech on a street deck . I was at college orientation the past two days and there is hardly any even decent spots to skate . Plus then getting decks , wheels , etc. would be easy ... <p> I 'll have to grow my hair out like darran nolan though . <p> Genji <p> 07-24-2008 , 12:00 AM <p> Like others have said , it all depends on how big of a price change you 're talking about . Overall though , I 'm always willing to pay a little more to get good stuff . If CB is already using good ( best quality ) materials then a marginal price increase should n't hurt sales . That is my philosophy . <p> But I 'm in the " Out of college , has good job " market segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 07-24-2008 , 01:21 AM <p> But I 'm in the " Out of college , has good job " market segment , which is n't most skaters . <p> Yeah , I voted for more expensive ( even though I really do n't have that much free money but I 'm in that mindset ) . As long as its not a dramatic increase the sales should remain consistent . I 've always believed in and practiced the " you get what you pay for " mantra . I 'm also a firm believer in the importance of reputation ( especially in a small market like freestyle skateboarding ) and if CB is known for the best quality wood , I would n't change that . <p> But who knows , six years ago I might 've thought the other way was better . <p> Timmy <p> 07-24-2008 , 01:38 AM <p> I 'd go with the cheaper low quality wood since i 'm pretty small and i 've never snapped a deck or chipped one badly <p> Dog4life <p> 07-24-2008 , 08:04 AM <p> I 'll talk later with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM <p> Asking the people is definitely the best approach to something like this . Set yourself in John 's position , he can say : <p> " Keeping the high quality wood that everyones loves might be a good idea . If these people enjoy the CB decks as much as they do , then they should be willing to pay a little more to keep the great quality decks they use and love . " <p> Or : <p> " Well , maybe people wo n't want to pay high prices for decks , and maybe cutting them down wo n't be such a bad idea after all . Even if the boards last them say two weeks less long that before , maybe with the price drop they wo n't mind buying new decks as much . " <p> Me ? I see it like this . Say it 's 50$ for a board that lasts you two months . You use three of these boards for a total for six months , and therefore you have spent 150$ over the span of two months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasts you one and a half month . You buy four , to last you a total of 6 months once again . What 's your price for these ? 160$ in the long run . <p> Buying better lasting boards for more is actually the logical thing to do from my point of view . <p> fallenNJzero <p> 07-24-2008 , 09:25 AM <p> depends on how much , like if the price is gon na double then i 'd say no , but i mean if the quality is gon na drop by a lot , then i 'd go with better quality <p> Zak Kimball <p> 07-24-2008 , 02:07 PM <p> if you think about it , you are paying $23 for a coloured blank and $33 for a full graphic that 's about $10 cheaper than ss or decomposed and the wood is superior . as long as the prices stay reasonable stay with madrid . also , i 'd rather have a $30 deck last me 2 months than 2 $20 decks last 1 month each . you save money on the deck and shipping , grip , skids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the last year im surprised the that the decks are still this cheap Quality&gt;price . <p> jelder <p> 07-28-2008 , 11:44 AM <p> Freestyle gear is pretty cheap .

They are n't called Hardflips for nothing though . <p> Russ <p> 06-16-2010 , 07:58 AM <p> Technically a 360 flip involves more to the trick than a hardflip does , so would n't that make it harder ? I mean you 're combining a 360 shuv it with a kickflip , whereas with the hardflip it 's only a 180 shuv it with a kickflip . Seems like there 's less to worry about with the hardflip , there 's less turn involved but you 're going the opposite way . If you can kickflip , it 's really just a question of which kind of pop shuv it you like more , yes ? <p> Rastariseup <p> 06-16-2010 , 09:07 AM <p> I 'd say hardlips are harder . <p> Noj <p> 06-16-2010 , 09:37 AM <p> You do n't see every skater doing hardflips to set their rhythm for a line , while there are countless lines with a 360 flip thrown in there . This is because 360 flips are such a natural , balanced trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hardflip because it 's an awkward , unnatural motion to learn . <p> Sure , once somebody 's got ' em , maybe the hardflip becomes super easy . I 'd still say the hardflip is harder , just because it involves a motion against the grain of the kickflip.

You are paying graphics and supporting your industry . If everyone bought blanks there would be far fewer skateparks and much less media like mags and movies . If you love skating you should at the very least buy a shop deck or logo board . <p> jameswalker33 <p> 08-09-2011 , 10:20 AM <p> They are pretty much the same , just paying for a the brand name and design of the board . <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> McCrank <p> 08-09-2011 , 11:34 AM <p> considering almost all skateboard companies are run by skateboarders i do n't mind paying a few extra for the brand name . these companies are paying the salaries of pro skaters which allows them to skate all day every day and push skating to new heights . i get to sit back and relax and enjoy some really good skating before i head out myself . <p> benlarsen <p> 08-09-2011 , 11:59 AM <p> I NEVER buy a blank deck or rarely buy a off brand cheap deck mainly because I want to support the skateboarding industry .

Also I always buy from shops for the same reason . <p> Noj <p> 08-09-2011 , 12:04 PM <p> The difference I have heard is that blanks are pressed in large batches , while pro models are made in smaller batches .

This game will be basically an any-trick-goes game , but the first round should be of a relatively moderate difficulty ( i.e. no big spin flips first round ) .

Without any outstanding image or gimmick , McEntire rose through the ranks of sponsored skateboarding and turned pro for Think skateboards a little over a year ago on the strength of his solid , consistent and technical skate ability alone . First popping up on our radar by winning the Tampa Am contest back in 2006 , the kid from Belton , Texas has done a lot of growing up , and a lot of skating , since then . <p> Brian FickThis kickflip is borderline ridiculous . The catch is so good . <p> How 's the pro life treating you ? To be honest with you it 's the same as the am life laughs . <p> Just hopefully a bigger paycheck ? A little bit . I got a little kick up from Think but I got a raise when I moved up to SF and that happened about a month before I turned pro . <p> In that going pro commercial you had for Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised ... Is it really the last one ? Nah , that was n't my idea that was theirs . <p> Good ! Because I thought that was lame . That would be like telling Reynolds not to do a frontside flip . LaughsA bunch of my homies were like , " Dude , when it said that it seemed like you died or something . " That was their deal , a little commercial for the hell of it . <p> Yeah , your buddy from Woodward last summer . Oh yeah ... that started with Jim Thiebaud founder of Real skateboards and Deluxe Distribution . I was out skating street with some of the Street Corner Distribution guys and the team manager , Josh said that Jim had this kid , I guess they were at Woodward skate camp , and Roger met Jim and Jim said that the kid would be super hyped if I gave him a call . I guess he was saying I was one of his favorite skaters or something ... I do n't know . <p> No , you ARE his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would mean a lot to this kid if I called him . So I called him and tried to talk to him but I could n't get a lot out of him , he just seemed nervous . But it was cool just talking to him and to know that there is someone out there who appreciates my skating that much . Its pretty humbling and flattering . <p> Do you ever read message boards or do you try to avoid that stuff ? Sometimes I 'll read them if I hear something really funny . On Thrasher those kids are vicious man . Most of the time I do n't really read them but sometimes I just know the kids on Thrasher are just going to say gnarly stuff so I 'll just check it out . Not just about myself , but if I have a homie on the Thrasher site . Some of the stuff is actually really cool when kids are like , " Keep it up ! " But then you 've got the ones like , " yo flips , I hate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those kids hate people . It 's awesome . <p> Brian FickSwitch heelflips are a respectible tech trick on flatground . It 's a select few , including Cody , who can take them down stacks like this . <p> Speaking of Yo Flips , there is a short list of people who can pull off the dangle foot 360 flip . I 'd say Nick Dompierre , you and ... Dude , I 'd give it to Daewon Song ! He 's the man with that for sure ! That 's the reason why I did it . Or like Zered Bassett . When I was a kid where I grew up that was the way you were supposed to do a 360 flip on tranny . You were supposed to throw your leg out and catch it with the front foot . It just shows that you have control over it . That to me was always tight growing up . Sometimes I 'll just mess around and do it and kids get way too bummed but I just like the way that it feels better . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterpipe but I think it feels cooler to do it the other way , you know ? <p> That 's rad . You do it because you like it like that . You do n't do it because you need that extra time to let the board get around ? No , it definitely helps me to do it over coping . Otherwise it just pops back but doing it like that it helps me to throw it out . When I was a kid that was how you knew you could tre flip , when you would steeze it out with that front foot catch . I remember seeing Daewon do it . I do n't really care what those kids think , I roll away from them and I feel good . <p> Are there any flatground tricks that you ca n't do ? It seems like you can do them all . Aw dude , my number one terrible trick : hardflips . I 've tried to get Dave Bachinsky to teach me and Wade DesArmo . Next I guess I 'll have to call Bryan Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about an hour trying to do it . I mean , I can do it in a game of SKATE but its more of an inward kickflip ( Laughs ) . That one gets me man , for sure . It 's one of the coolest looking tricks though ! It 's like my shoulders do n't turn right or something . Maybe someday . <p> I feel your pain on that one . I do them like Chad Muska . How about this basement that your dad build built . What 's the deal with that ? Actually it 's not a basement , it 's a room . My dad , the only way I could put it , is a man 's man . He 's a good ol ' boy . If you 've got a problem , he can fix it . He knows everything about cars and houses . He 's a jack of all trades . He 's a carpenter and he re-did my whole house when we moved in , and then , after about seven years of living there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a pool table room . " So he built this huge room onto my house that has guitars , a pool table , skateboards everywhere . It looks like nothing I 've ever seen before because he built the whole thing himself . I 'm so hyped on it . <p> Brian FickRelease the hounds ! This frontside flip is huge . <p> Have you ever woken up to a priest praying over you ? Who are you talking to to get this stuff about me ? ! <p> My real question is , were you being exercised ? No . I think he thought I was dying or just being a hoodlum . Pretty much Bachinsky and I went out our first night in Russia and had a bit of a hoorah . So by the end of the night we were n't exactly sure which way was up and for some reason we could n't work the key to get into our room . So we had to sleep outside .

Carving halfpipes , mostly forward , less witch landings , was how they rode in the late 80s . That 's why boards had a distinct front and back . People did n't spend much time riding switch back then . Look at the other decks from pre 1990 .

Nose shape for better grabbing those huge airs . I think Skull Skates licensed the shape for some Hosoi decks under their umbrella , uh , such a long time ago . Christian was changing companies constantly , so there are lots of variations around . Here 's some info from artofskateboarding.com " Hosoi , Skull Skates and the Pink ( and other color ) Hammerheads One of the most discussed decks as a possible fake is the pink and black Hosoi Hammerhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Skull Skates . Christian 's dad , Ivan , came up with the graphic . Around 1986 or so , you can find ads in Thrasher and such for Hosoi " Hammerheads " by " Hosoi " , ie. no Skull Skates . Also , you will see ads by Skull Skates that in effect read " if it does n't say Skull Skates , it 's not legit " . So how did all this confusion come about ? Based on postings to several forums , we found the following information : &lt;name withheld&gt; " .... I have been told since the mid 90s that the pink and black hosoi 's without the skull skates logo were manufactured on the west coast by a skateboard distributor . AWH distribution out of Ohio bought hundreds of them back in the day and upon receiveing them freaked out and sent them back.The same distributor was caught by World Industries making bootleg decks and t-shirts and selling them over seas.The same distributor was also caught buying stolen merchandise off of World Industries employees and caused a huge scandal in the skateworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as 65.00 , I have never bought one . There is a more involved story about Hosoi hopping companys so often in the 80s that Ivan Hosoi had some manufactured and sold them.As well as skull skates supposedly making some without a skull skates logo . I got a lot of this info from Monty Nolder one drunken night , as well as talking to employees at trade shows over the last 7 or 8 years . Oh , this distributor is also the one responsible for the blind , world , plan b decks that have been showing up on ebay.These are new school decks with new school hole patterns with laser copies/left over slick graphics sublimated on to them . Remember these decks are not slicks like the old school boards.These bootlegs are sublimated . A process that did n't  become popular untill 1998 . Maybe 1997 . Beware any Plan B-Sal Barbier Pollution , Plan b -Danny Way Lepercaun , Blind- Guy Mariano Accidental Gun Death , Plan B-Danny Way Shotgun , 101 - kris markovich Evil Kenivel , 101 - Gabriel Rodriguez Punisher/Penalizer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple more ... " &lt;name withheld&gt; " I might add that with Hosoi hopping from manufacturer to manufacturer in the ' 80s , saw many of these manufacturers stuck with decks that had been pressed prior to being informed they 'd been dumped . For all intents and purposes , these decks were legitimate Hosoi decks . Of course , I 'm sure some companies continued to press the decks on purpose . Also , feeding the confusion were the ads Skull Skates put out when they started making Hosoi 's decks that claimed that " if it does n't say Skull Skates on it , it 's fake " -which is patently absurd ! But despite the absurdidty , it worked . And the legend of the Hosoi fakes continues to mutate as it 's passed on again and again . " &lt;name withheld&gt; " What 's up ! I was going to trash your *fakes* page until I read it . Christian himself personnaly authenticated them . I friend of mine who bought a truck load of them about 10 years ago had Christian sign a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Christian said this guy made them for him and then kept on making them after he went to Skull Skates . Christian and PD tried to sue him , but as he explains in numerous interviews , the legal costs got to be to much in relation to the $2-$3 per deck royalty he hoped to receive from the law suit . " &lt;from Positive Destiny ( aka.PD ) of Skull Skates&gt; " These boards were all produced by " Wee Willie Winkels " in Canada for this shady guy named Robert Rose while Christian Hosoi was under contract with Skull Skates .... we ran the skull Skates ' " real Hosoi " ad , and they started bootlegging the Skull Skates Hosoi 's too ! I recently acquired one of these very Skull/Hosoi bootlegs directly from Winkels himself Very unscrupulous to say the least ! I guess in between Skull Skates and Santa Cruz is when they Christian/Ivan were selling boards out of the trunk of a car n'stuff , but I 'm not sure . I was over it by that time . We paid Christian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith even though neither of them seemed too interested in stopping the distribution of these bootlegs it goes on until this day . An east coast distributor was buying 5000 pcs. per order knowing they were not legit . We have heard rumours that the Hosoi 's were getting paid royalties for the fakes but never knew for sure . These fakes are of terrible quality inside out and threatened our reputation for top quality construction because people thought we built that crap . I love Christian , and I had the privledge to skate with him many times during the course of his Skull Skates sponsership and beleive him to be one of the most gifted people I have ever seen skateboard I first saw Christian in 1979 at Marina del Rey skatepark in the upper keyhole and knew then he was going to take skating to another level but it 's the most hassle I 've ever had to go through in almost 25 years of making skateboards . " And as always , check pictures on eBay very closely . Blemished decks or factory seconds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the " Advanced Search " option , the seller 's past history and feedback . Look for anything in the history that may look sketchy ( i.e. using another user i 'd to bid on their own items .... yes , it happens .... or listing the same deck every number of days ) . My best advice is to deal only with collectors you trust ! "

Check it out : <p> Link to article or read below The cat is out of the bag : two-time Thrasher magazine Skater of The Year Chris Cole is riding for DC Shoes . Prior to this move , Cole had a long run with Fallen Footwear . Cole rode for Fallen since that brand 's inception . Fallen is the brainchild of Jamie Thomas , the pro skater that founded the Fallen brand as well as Zero skateboards Cole 's board sponsor and Black box distribution . Thomas and Cole have been friends and teammates for years . I spoke with Cole on the eve of the team change announcement about his big decision and what it means for his future . <p> So just to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your new sponsor ? My new shoe sponsor is DC Shoes . I 'm really psyched about it . <p> Are you riding for DC clothing as well ? Nope , just shoes .

Can you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with DC ? Who approached you or did you approach them ? It had been thrown out there a long time ago , but it was n't the right time for me . The rumors were circulating a long time before I had even given it real consideration , honestly .

You had a long run with Fallen , since its beginning and you 're obviously tight with Jamie Thomas . How did the decision to leave Fallen come about and was it a hard decision to make for you ? It was definitely a hard decision . It did n't happen over night and I definitely had a lot of pondering to do . Ha ha ! Jamie and I talked about it from the moment it was brought up , until the moment it was settled . I never wanted to pull the rug from under Fallen 's feet and I feel like I am leaving Fallen at a good time for Fallen as well as a good time for me . It 's not easy to walk away from the company who I 've been with during monumental moments in my career , and run by one of my best friends , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status on Zero skateboards at all ? Not at all . I 'm more involved with Zero than I ever have been , and that will not change . <p> Are you filming a part for the upcoming " Cold War " video ? I 'm trying to . I 'm trying to conjure up tours whenever I can because the team is so damn fun , but its tough . I try to put a full part with every video that comes out , but that gets harder and harder regardless of what you have going on otherwise , but I am also not short on having other s**t going on . It will get done though and I hope people enjoy it . <p> You 've got some friends over at DC for sure and judging from the hype videos , your new teammates seem really excited to have you as part of their squad . Of the entire team , who are you the most excited to travel and tour with and why ? That 's a tough question , but I really appreciate what people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such awesome things from teammates , mangers , filmers , editors , and fans alike . So thanks ! But touring ... I really do like everyone : Matt Miller is truly awesome . I 've always been a fan of Nick Dompierre and obviously Josh Kalis . I do n't know if Danny Way tours , but that would definitely elevate my skating . I do n't know if Rob Dyrdek tours either , but it 'd be a blast if he did . <p> If you could have any former member of the DC team from any of its eras , who would you want back on the squad so you could have them as a teammate and why ? Stevie Williams . I 'm a huge fan . Actually the whole DC Euro Tour squad would be incredible as well . <p> How soon will DC have a pro model shoe ready for you ? Fall of 2011 my first shoe drops .

Hopefully I can tour places I 've never been and get to some places kids have been asking me to visit forever . I want to see them as much as they want to see me , I think . No more children Cole has two children at home ...

@@108987937 @4387937/ 161565 @qwx1021565 <p> I think longboarding is more of a form of transportation around here . When I lived in San Marcos everyone used longboards to get around . Another thing I love about long boards is one push is like 6 on a street setup . <p> Longboarding is skateboarding ........ its a piece of wood ( most of the time anyway ) with 2 trucks and 4 wheels .... any attempt by people who ride long or short boards to speak otherwise are just haters ... I have a lot of boards though this is an old shot I usually ride at least on of them every day <p> yeah in my town groups of like 10 kids get together and go down the worst roads ever , not even steep . and to top it off they have ppl take pics of them so they can put it on f****n facebook &gt;. &lt; kinda ruins any view i have on it haha <p> There 's nothing wrong with long boarding in my opinion . I 've only tried it a few times and it was alright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a skateboard , so if your talking **** about people who long board , your a hypocrite. 161572 @qwx1021572 161568 @qwx1021568 161562 @qwx1021562 161569 @qwx1021569 161564 @qwx1021564 <p> i would love to own a longboard , but the $200 i would have to put in to buy one , i would much rather spend it on new decks for when i brake mine every 3 weeks . <p> You do realize longboarding is actually cheaper ? Wheels take a while to wear out even if you do a lot of slides , trucks never grind so they pretty much last forever , and the boards are not meant to be skated in ways that would snap them . <p> Personally , I think skateboarding is a horrible form of transportation and longboarding is definitely a step up for getting around town . Bombing hills on a longboard takes balls ( or dumbassery ) .

The show will honor sports stars and moments of the year . <p> " I like a challenge , " Hawk says . " I like to explore new things , and I feel like I 'm capable of doing it . " <p> Though he 's competed and performed skateboard feats before hundreds of thousands of people , been a presenter on other award shows and become a merchandising titan , Hawk has never been the solo host of a live awards show . <p> " Anything live is scary , " he says . " There are many other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part if something goes awry , you 're the one with the responsibility to bring it back together .

" Most of the other awards shows are all over the place . " <p> The " Hall of Games Awards , " created by IMG Media , will get Cartoon Network viewers involved in multiple platforms . Production on promos for the awards happened last week , but Hawk does n't expect to work on the show until closer to air . <p> For Hawk , the TV gig is the latest step in a monster career that has taken him from being a kid on a skateboard in San Diego to a 42-year-old global icon with licensed product lines and video games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which he says no . As a father of four constantly on the go , he 's not willing to give up what family time he has . <p> " It 's just not something I want to impose on my kids , that 's the bottom line , " Hawk says . " It could be really entertaining . There are things I do , literally from changing diapers in parking lots to jumping on private jets to Abu Dhabi . It 's a paradox , my life , and super-hectic . I would n't feel right about capitalizing on the lifestyle itself . " <p> He never expected his career to be where it is . When he started out , no one in the sport was making a living the way he does today . And no one else has achieved the kind of success he has had with multiple brands and marketing areas . <p> Although many in the audience for " Hall of Games " may see him as a hero , he disagrees . <p> " To be honest , I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says .

Maintenance For one we do n't  have to fix a chain or air up them wheels . I hate pumping air into a tire . Its irritating and getting a flat is even more irritating .

Skateboarding definitely wins when it comes to fixing up your goods quicker.I 've never seen a BMX snap in half before ... <p> 5 . Carry your bike ? I think not .

Does anyone here play guitar ? For the first cople of months you get blisters on your hands everytime you play and then it gradually stops . Yeah holding handlebars is the same way . <p> 7 .

You can ride them on all types of terrain not only actually making transportation easier but enabling you to have fun while you go <p> 4 . Bailing On a bike you cant really throw it out as easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come right back and hit you or worse you 'll get stuck with it . Its asking for double trouble when you are already going to eat **** from trying a trick . Imagine scorpioning it only to have a bike peg you on the head on top of you already scraping face first on the pavement . Ouch.If your a skater that 's never been owned by a pebble or a crack then I do n't  even know what to say ... Anyways youve yet agian proved bmxing is more dangerous and yes danger=gnar <p> 3 . Pegs ? Grinding objects with pegs decreases its grind span . I have seen countless skatepark coping absolutely ruined by bike pegs . Plus it does n't  even look cool . Floating down a ledge on a skateboard just looks 20 times smoother and better . Which leads me to the next dominating reason.Whether grinds look better on a skateboard or bike is up to the person but really bmx has more than just that . Some of the pros grind handrails on just bolts . Also if you say doing a 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then what makes skateboarding so much better ? <p> 2 . Skateparks Yes they are called " SKATEPARKS " not " BIKEPARKS " . Yes we have the parks named after us which makes me wonder why all the dudes on bikes show up acting all hard booting kids on skateboards out of the way . Jerks.Skateparks , ie : rollerskate parks , the term skate " board " park , is relatively modern . <p> 1 . And the number one reason why skateboarding dominates on bmx . Our family jewels ! ! ! No joke landing on those seats must do a lot of damage to your boys . Some of us would like to have kids at some point in our life.Yet agian you prove bmx is more dangerous and danger=gnar <p> " Man my daddy told me , boy when I was your age I had to walk 13 miles to school . I said oh , is that why you did n't graduate ? "

I was hoping that I could get the clips I made in their native 1080 resolution and video edit them using Ulead Media Studio Pro . I can convert the formats and all that and am very adept with editing and such but those clips on skate.reel are in too small a resolution . <p> I was hoping that the videos would simply show up in the XBox media section but they do n't . <p> Wow , this is possibly the post post I 've seen from a newer are all meant to shine as children do .

@@108987963 @4387963/ <p> Hey guys I just recently started skating bowls and I cant seem to flow . I can drop in at any part of the bowl and I can drop in , hit the deep end , slash on the copping , but when I come out of the deep end I loose all my speed . I can go on a halfpipe for some time . But as I said I just ca n't flow in a bowl . I do n't think I have a problem pumping down tranny , just up it . Any tips on how to pump or just flow better in a bowl ? <p> NoSwitch <p> 07-18-2011 , 08:17 PM <p> Sweep your arms forward and up while transitioning up . Try to unweight as you start the rise by crouching as you leave the bottom then straightening your legs some to kid of jump while sweeping your arms forward and up as you go up . That will get you farther up it then turn and push off the bottom and dip preparing to sweep out and up again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club . <p> I 've been riding bowls for about 9 months , and am just barely starting to feel like I have anything resembling a solid carve . And yet the youngsters rip it at twice my speed . <p> I 'd love to find a how-to on carving bowls , but maybe this is the start of one . Here 's all I know ( or , really , all I guess--feel free to disagree ) : <p> In General The walls of bowls are typically quite different from half pipes . Feel them out with kick turns , and riding fakie . Remember bowl transitions bowl--do n't rely on them to run just up and down . Keep your shoulders straight . Use your ankles , knees , and hips . Big body motions seem to be self-defeating . Stay loose ( without killing yourself ) . That goes for your trucks , too . Try pumping at different spots each time till you feel it . Some people actually pump three times : up , sideways , down/out . Go with the flow . Unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ; try to mimic their style at first . <p> Round Pockets Do n't pump like a half pipe , pump a little higher up on the wall to speed through the carve . Think about yourself riding circular--just like the bowl . Trace out your carve in your mind . Find targets on the wall to aim for . I see some guys almost dip their bodies below their bowls high on the wall as they whip around--as if their head was a pivot point ! <p> Square Pockets These are all about timing , but you can get tons of speed--maybe more than on round pockets . Some people pump down the corners , some pump up the corners . <p> NP . But seriously , reply here with what 's working for you , because I 'm shooting in the dark . <p> Alecography <p> 07-19-2011 , 12:05 AM <p> It seems like you have a little more of an idea then I do , I should be hitting the park tomorrow I will let you know what happens . <p> Reo <p> 07-19-2011 , 08:10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've noticed that most guys who maintain a constant speed on bowls do n't seem to flail their arms much . They also seem to hunch forward a little and keep their whole body compact and small . <p> And having larger wheels kinda helps . <p> The Beard <p> 07-19-2011 , 08:52 AM <p> treat it like a lady . work those hips . caress the nooks <p> Number6 <p> 07-19-2011 , 12:29 PM <p> I have a slightly related question .

Still working on getting every thing worked out but today I defiantly had my best runs . <p> ramos <p> 07-21-2011 , 06:47 AM <p> Basically the biggest difference from miniramps to bowls is the corners . The thing is , when you pump on a half pipe , you kind of pump into the transition , if you get what I mean . But on corners ( you usually pump the above mentioned three times , but when just starting out , go with one pump ) you pump much later , actually as you are exiting the corner . So here is the approach cut out for you : <p> 1 . Approach the corner with a moderate speed , aim as high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coping ) <p> 2 . Bend your knees while entering <p> 3. extend your knees , pushing the board into the wall while exiting <p> The last part is what should give you your speed . From here on , try entering with more speed , go higher , and possibly pump into the corner as well , keep your knees bent , and then extend ( pump ) again on the exit . <p> Hope that makes sense ? <p> DHart <p> 07-21-2011 , 10:42 AM <p> Corners will generate more speed but many bowls do n't have corners . I pump anytime there is something to pump on . Most peoples problem is they try to skate a bowl like a ramp . You have to carve sometimes you have to hit a wall to get the speed you need to hit the next wall . Try going in a figure 8 if you are in a pool and you will learn to get faster . Hips are your best friend if you pump up a hip and then back down it will increase your speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing uglier then watching someone go back and forth in a straight line in a bowl .

For example : if I want to hit the wall on the opposite side more dead-on ie. for frontside airs or stalls , or if I want to approach it an angle for grinds . <p> Figure out your line , and when you 're getting the feel for a certain bowl , try do some form of a line in the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl , some bowls are just built for goofy or regular skaters , and people in the opposite stance , have to work harder ) . <p> ShredTheGnar <p> 07-22-2011 , 04:18 AM <p> It just takes practice , learning the nuances of the ramp , etc . Once you 've got that figured out you can hit pretty much everything . It 's not anything that anyone can tell you , it 's just a " click " . I 've been skating primarily bowl and pools ever since I began skating ( 11 years ago ) and it just takes time .

Square corners will give you the most speed when you pump them right but they 're hard to pump at first . But yeah , literally pump on anything you can . At my local park there is a long shallow ( 6 foot section ) that I basically just carve on the straight wall , come down in the round corner , come back up on the other side , and carry my speed back on that straight wall .

I so far love skateboarding and practice hours everyday but I understand that fat people ca n't skateboard well because they have too much weight on the board . Right now i 'm still skinny fit since its only been 6 months of lifting weight and progression in weight lifting is slow , but i 'm wondering when I do become stronger and put on more muscle weight would it hinder my skateboarding ? I know muscle strength is beneficial for bmx but for skateboarding is it a disadvantage ? <p> I definitely do n't think gaining muscle could hinder your skateboarding ability . If anything it will help your ability because your physically stronger and more capable of physically performing tricks that require strength , balance , and coordination . <p> Originally Posted by Panda <p> Imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger on a skateboard ... <p> Hah .

I weighed approximately 230 pounds for some time and skated well but it took much more exertion . I lost around 60-65 pounds ( typically stay within 165-170 range ) and my skating ability increased quite substantially . I ca n't really attest to whether or not if it was becoming more physically fit or the weight loss , but I would be willing to bet it was a symbiotic relationship . <p> I must say that I miss the flab when I bail though .

I do n't have tons of money to buy a board and I 'm not even sure if I 'll be good at it . The board would be just for getting to class , no tricks or anything fancy at first . So I had planned at spring break , a week away , to build a board . <p> I 've done my reading and seen a lot of videos on the subject but am still unsure . I 've seen some with concave bends , someone without . Some made of one solid sheet of wood and some veneer ....... <p> So what are some general guideline when building ? Should it be concave ? Should it been veneer ? What kind of wood should I use ? Is there a pattern for the wood grain ? How many layers and at what thicknesses ? How big should the wheelbase be ? I 'm 6 ' 200lbs. .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found this : eastbilt.com/uncutboards ( ca n't post a link , add www to the beginning and htm to the end ) Should I just buy a blank and cut it myself ? Which blank should I buy , the one with a concave or without ? <p> It 's a lot to take in at once so thank a ton for your help I 'll ask about hardware later <p> Toothless is the one of the simpler methods buts its still gon na cost youThe Builders Forum at Silverfish is probably the best place to do research .... Eastbilt presses a nice board the 12x48 cut your own blank would be a good start . Wheelbase depends on how stable you want it to be , I have longboards with wheel bases from 20 " to 36 " but most are in the high 20 " to low 30 " range . for your needs my guess is 26-30 " on a board shorter than 40 " so it will not be cumbersome in most classrooms . IMO you need to have some curve in a board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a few rockered flat boards and they are easy to stay on but I have ridden flat planks than they require really agressive griptape to insure that I did n't slide off in a hard turn Rockered boards are fun but they can be an acquired taste . <p> Thanks a ton I 'm just going to order the concave without kicktails/nose one from eastbilt . It will be much simpler than building a press to get a concave . I 'll draw something up for board design and post it here so it 's easier to get advice about truck size . <p> I little more than I wanted to spend but I 'll deal with it . Last question before I order . What size bolts do I need ( can be 7/8 " all the way to 2 " ) ? Do I need risers ? Do I need bearing spacers ? Is that EVERYTHING I need to get things rolling ?

After that Christian left Alva and hit up Santa Cruz . They started making him the Hammerheads too .

KIckflips and Ollies were n't really the major focus when the deck was designed of skating that they are today . Carving halfpipes , mostly forward , less witch landings , was how they rode in the late 80s . That 's why boards had a distinct front and back .

I just do flatland stuff , powerslides .. just the basics cos I 'm slowly getting back into skating . <p> Anyway .. to the wheels . <p> These wheels are quite smooth on the bitumen , not as smooth as the ride I get from my Barbee cruiser ( but then again , that board has 65mm 80a Cored Powell Bombers ) . You can still feel the little bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterned brickwork which gets tiresome/annoying after a while .

Ie : I put my food on the kicktail and then drop it and count how many times the front of the board will rebound ' up ' and bounce . For comparison my cruiserboard , I get about 8-9times on my cruiser board ( with 80A wheels ) . With the Travewells I get around 4-5 , which seems ok . So they really are n't that much bouncy . <p> Powersliding on these wheels going at a 3 HARD push speed is very difficult , I can only manage a rear wheel slide riding regular .

When trying frontside airs in my friends mini , I found out that a slightly longer ( 34 inch , and 8+1/2 wide ) deck allowed me to land them more easily , I had an easier rotation/board stayed on my feet easier , etc , with a longer deck . The shape was modern though , with a round nose and tail . The disadvantage was the deck was weaker and broke more easily . <p> So , what are the differences ? Which one is better for tranny ?

I had one once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a square tail , but had straight rails instead of round ones , like the one Gator rode in the 80 's . <p> So , what are the advantages/disadvantages of certain shapes ?

@@108988001 @4388001/ <p> Just recently after perfecting my small bag of tricks I decided that it 's time to learn the dreaded kickflip . Everytime I go out and skate I mess around with it , but now I figured it 's time to get serious . So I 've been trying and trying to get them , and I 'm making no progress at all . I know that being frustrated does n't help , but I 'm going insane because I just ca n't land it . <p> Some times it feels land-able and others it flies out in front of me . I really just need some basic trick tip advice or at least some things that help YOU do it . I know there are tons of videos out there on Youtube-- they all just seem like amateurs giving bad advice . I am willing to put effort into it I 'm just not doing something right in my mind . <p> Jonloe <p> 01-15-2011 , 04:54 PM <p> kick flips are of the devil . i pretty much just skipped them when i was starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pretty sketchy. i 'm much more of a heelflip man . in retrospect though , it would have been nice if i had learned them early on . if the board is flying out in front of you , it means your flicking above the pocket , on the actual nose of the board . remember , when you flick , you kinda have to flick behind you if that makes sense . <p> Instrumental <p> 01-15-2011 , 04:56 PM <p> All right , first off , committing to the trick , if you only do the motions needed to complete a trick half way , that 's the only result you 'll get , so you need to make sure you get a full solid pop , you need to make sure you get a good jump that stays centered over your board , you need a good flick that comes off right around the concave and you need to be able to spot your landing proper . There is no point in only committing to one part of the trick and not the other because ultimately , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you flick the board so it goes all the way around but you do n't jump proper and you land before your board does , that means you only know how to flick the board with an improper jump and you 're still going to have to learn how to flick the board properly when you jump properly . <p> Basically it comes down to timing , the mechanics of the trick are pretty much the same as an ollie . You slide your front foot much in the same way you do a normal ollie , except instead of it staying centered , you go slightly diagonally so your toe slides off the board where it bends up . And same with the heelflip except you move your foot in the opposite direction . <p> kk360 <p> 01-15-2011 , 05:02 PM <p> I messed around with kickflips until I landed one with the tip of my toes , then I got serious . <p> It 's funny because my friend was saying ' ' Dude why do n't you do kickflips ' ' , I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried , I nearly landed it , my heels were on the ground and my toes on the edge of my board .

Then just as quickly as it started , the craze began to die down . This was due to some safety experts in 1965 . The early skateboard wheels were made out of materials such as clay and metal which caused alot of accidents due to the wheels buckling .

In the beginning . OK the history was good but I lived it . <p> In the beginning in Southern California about 1957 when old steel roller skates broke we would take them and nail them to a 2x4 and nail another 2x4 upright to make a make shift scooter . What happened was the upright would break off and we would still ride the left over board . So was born the skateboard . ( Back to the Future had a scene like that probably some old fart like me wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a smooth concrete surface most often at the local schools when no one was there . If there was even one piece of gravel you would hit it and it would immediately stop the board and you would do a header . Road rash on the palms of your hands , torn knees on your jeans , scraped knees and occasionally your face and chin would get a hit . My contention is that toy makers just watched what kids were doing and developed toys from those home made ones . We were so excited when that first red skate board was manufactured at least the surface was wider and the wheels would n't fall off ! It was still the immediate stop when the metal wheels hit a piece of gravel . We used to play with old pie tins and soon after the frisbee was marketed . Anyway when the nylon wheels finally came and they could roll over the gravel and could be ridden on asphalt then that was the true beginning of the modern skateboard . I was a Southern California boy and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a transition from skates to scooters to skateboards . We just made do with what we had for toys when they broke we figured out other ways to use them . <p> Originally Posted by Lukeaxx <p> Because I am unbelievably bored , because I have nothing better to do and because i 'm a freak and enjoy writing ...

Could be wrong , could be right ... I do n't really know <p> B1950s/B <p> In the 1950s the surfing craze was in full swing , people started to realize that the newly created skateboards or sidewalk surfboards could be used to recreate the feel of skateboarding , without getting wet The connection with surfing is what gave skateboarding the feel it has today . It influenced everything in skateboarding , the terrain ( transitions etc .. ) and the skater style . It was during this time trucks were modified to allow more of a surfing wave feel ... because Rollerblade trucks could only go in a straight line . The first roller derby skateboard went on sale in 1959 . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plank with modified roller blade wheels on the underside . The wheels were made out of steel . The board had no concave , no kicks and no griptape . The wheels provided no grip on any surface and they were almost impossible to turn . It may look and be terrible but this was the basis for the skateboard of today . <p> 1960s <p> In the early 1960s surf inspired skateboards started to be mass produced , some notable companies include Larry Stevenson 's Makaha and others . Skateboarding became very popular very quickly . Companies had to fight for demand . Over 50 million skateboards were sold in five years and the first official skateboarding competition was held in California in 1963 . Then just as quickly as it started , the craze began to die down . This was due to some safety experts in 1965 . The early skateboard wheels were made out of materials such as clay and metal which caused alot of accidents due to the wheels buckling . Safety experts said skateboarding was extremely dangerous , and urged people not to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to let their kids skate . As teenagers were the main skaters , this ruined the skateboarding industry . This was the first of many slumps that skateboarding has had , commonly reffered to as the " 10 year cycle " . Even though the downs and ups of skateboarding were actually more frequent than 10 years in between . Skateboarding was even made illegal in some states due to the lack of safety . <p> - A skateboard from the 1960s . <p> - A skater in the 1960s . It is obvious to see the surfer style . <p> 1970s <p> It was during this first slump that Larry Stevenson , being one of the biggest skateboard manufacturers , invented the kicktail . This opened up a whole new world for skateboarding , tricks were now possible ! But skaters were still largely limited by equipment , especially the steel wheels and safety regulations . Then in 1973 , possible the best thing that ever happened to skateboarding was invented . The urethene wheel . The new wheels were strong and sturdy , but provided plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , made skateboarding a million times safer . The kickturn and the urethene wheel made boards alot more safe and useful . Then came specially constructed trucks just for skating , this provided the ability to turn with ease . Now the skaters could do whatever they wanted , especially in the world of tricks . Tricks at this time included surfing like maneouvres on banks and empty pools were used for the first time . Freestyle became very popular at this time , which involved doing technical tricks on flatground . It was Freestyle which finally drew the line between surfing and skateboarding , creating an entirely new sport . Skateboards became very popular and the business side grew dramatically . Concrete skate parks were built , especially in california . Professional skateboarders were seen as a rank now and the first skate magazines and films started coming out . Modern skateboarding evolved , and a new discipline was created . Vert Skateboarding . This joined the already extremely popular slalom , downhill and freestyle styles . The ollie and the invert were invented close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kickturn , marked an extreme change to the things skaters could do . It was during this time you could actually become a star through skateboarding , and huge names such as Rodney Mullen , Tony Hawks and Stacey Peralta came out into the open . Skateboards became wider , producing more stability in vert skateboarding and skateboarding , as we know it , was born . But it still ha a long way to come . Near the end of the 70s skateboarding hit another slump . Insurance and slowing attendance meant alot of the new skateparks went out of business . Enter ... the 1980s . <p> - Freestyle skateboarding opened up an entire knew area in skateboarding tricks , and finally seperated surfing and skateboarding . <p> - Big names , such as Stacey Peralta , became stars through skateboarding .
