Our Sun is a main sequence star which creates thermal energy essential to life on Earth . This thermal energy comes from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun 's core . When two hydrogen isotopes combine , they release a helium atom , a freed neutron , and a substantial amount of radiant energy or light . While these rays of light may take anywhere from 10,000 to 170,000 years to reach the Sun 's surface from its core , once at the surface , they take roughly 8.3 minutes to reach Earth , where they then provide us with light and warmth , as well as energy for your solar panel to capture and utilize . <p> Solar power converts sunlight into electricity , either directly using photovoltaics ( PV ) , or indirectly using concentrated solar power ( CSP ) . <p> Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted into heat . This solar thermal energy is then converted into electrical energy by the addition of a steam turbine or another type of heat engine connected to an electrical power generator . As of 2014 , Spain utilizes the largest amount CSP worldwide at a total capacity of 2,204 MW . <p> Photovoltaics work by utilizing the photovoltaic effect , which is the creation of electric current within a material after exposing it to light . The photovoltaic effect is directly related to , although different from and not to be confused with , the photoelectric effect . The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of electrons being released from a given metal when the given metal is exposed to light . Photovoltaics were initially , and still are , used to power small and medium-sized applications , from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to off-grid homes powered by a photovoltaic array .

@@6810013 @10013/ <h> Nafion Tubing <p> Nafion tubing is a highly selective , semi-permeable membrane to water vapor . If gases inside Nafion tubing are wetter than gases surrounding the tubing , drying will occur . If the surrounding gases are wetter , humidification will occur . In normal use , a portion of Nafion tubing is used as a portion of the tube between a gas sample stream and a sensor . If the sample stream is much wetter than ambient air ( such as breath samples ) , the sample falls to ambient humidity . If the sample stream inside is much drier than ambient air ( such as calibration cylinder gases ) , the sample rises to ambient humidity . <p> Because Nafion uses sulfur ions to selectively transport water molecules out of the tubing , it is not gas permeable . Therefore , Nafion can be used successfully to dry virtually any gas . Nafion is also recommended to be used with water traps and hydrophobic filters that are included with all sampling devices . Install the tubing after the filters for optimum performance and protection of the sensor . 
@@6810014 @10014/ <p> Sir William Grove first demonstrated the technology behind fuel cells in 1839 . The gas battery , later named the fuel cell , reversed the well-understood principal of electrolysis to generate an electrical current . Grove 's invention was largely a curiosity as the age was captivated by the horseless carriage and the large reserves of petroleum that were being discovered . Fuel cells remained in obscurity until 1960 when the upstart government agency , The National Aeronautic and Space Administration ( NASA ) , began looking for a practical power source for extended missions to space . Through research and development sponsored by NASA and private industry , the fuel cell is poised to become a replacement for the internal combustion engine and redesign the utility industry by making energy cleaner , cheaper and portable . <p> How much does it cost to run a 1 kW Fuel Cell on hydrogen ? <p> The cost of operating a 1kW fuel cell for 7.26 hours when only one cylinder is purchased per month is $134 . This is equivalent to $18.40 per hour to operate at one kilowatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the cost is reduced . Assuming that 5 cylinders of hydrogen are consumed in one month , this gives 7.26 x 5 = 36.33 hours of operation . The cost of the cylinders is ( 5 x $100 ) + ( 5 x $14 ) + $20 = $590 . This is equivalent to $16.24 per hour to operate at one kilowatt . <p> How do fuel cells work ? <p> How does a Fuel Cell Generate Electricity ? <p> Fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction , known as reverse electrolysis . This reaction combines hydrogen and oxygen to form water vapor , heat and electricity . All three of the by-products of this reverse electrolysis reaction can be further utilized by the fuel cell system . Waste heat can be utilized for space heating and cooling . The water vapor can be captured and used as the feedstock for additional hydrogen and the electricity is channeled into an external circuit where it is used by any electric appliance . <p> What fuels do fuel cells use to produce electricity ? <p> One advantage of fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , fuel cells can extract hydrogen from a wide variety of currently available fossil fuels ( e.g. Natural gas , methanol , coal , etc . ) . From fossil fuels , fuel cells utilize one natural element as their fuel , hydrogen , the most abundant element on Earth . In addition to fossil fuels , hydrogen can be generated renewably from water and other photobiological means . <p> What are the Major Components for a Residential Fuel Cell System ? <p> In a residential fuel cell system there are three main components . The source of hydrogen , the actual fuel cell stacks and the power condition unit . The hydrogen can either be reformed from fossil fuels ( i.e. natural gas , propane , etc ) or the unit can be coupled to a renewable energy source and generate hydrogen through electrolysis of water . The fuel cell stack is the part , which converts the hydrogen and oxygen into electricity , water vapor and heat . The last piece is the power conditioner . This inverts the DC current from the fuel cell into AC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the effects and benefits of fuel cell utilization ? <p> What are the Benefits of Fuel Cells ? <p> What are the Benefits of Fuel Cells ? Environmental - Fuel Cells achieve high fuel efficiency while emitting extremely low emissions . Engineering - Fuel cells operate on a wide variety of fuels , utilize electrochemical reactions and contain no moving parts . These features make them simple to operate , quiet and extremely reliable . <p> Is Hydrogen Safe ? <p> Hydrogen is a medium for storing energy . To be useful as an energy carrier , all fuels , such as gasoline and natural gas , have a characteristic of being volatile . Hydrogen 's benefits differ from the fossil fuels commonplace in an advanced energy utilizing society such as in the United States . Hydrogen is non-toxic . Gasoline and oil are extremely toxic and poisonous humans along with wildlife when unintentionally released into the environment . If a hydrogen spill occurred , the hydrogen would evaporate almost immediately leaving only water behind . Oil and gasoline , on the other hand , require immense cleanup efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline or oil seeps into the surrounding ecosystem wrecking irreparable harm . The hydrogen used in fuel cells is stored within a metal hydride , a solid crystalline-like molecule structure , the hydrogen is chemically bonded to the solid metal power and when released , returns to gas form . Due to this compact molecular structure , leaks in a tank containing metal hydride release hydrogen gas very slowly , allowing you more time to rectify and bypass an otherwise potentially dangerous scenario . Examples of metal hydrides are , lithium hydride , magnesium hydride , and calcium hydride . <p> If I install a residential fuel cell , what kind of reduction in my utility bill can I anticipate ? <p> Many factors enter into what your actual savings will be . These factors include ; individual electricity consumption , geographic location , the particular utility , if utilizing a reformer the price of natural gas or propane , the avoided costs of installing lines to your residence when located in an off-grid area , etc . <p> What if my residential unit has excess electricity ? Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell electricity back into the grid depends on the geographic location of the unit . Many states have net metering laws , which allow qualified customers to sell surplus electricity back to the grid . Individual states vary on the amount of electricity each individual is allowed to sell , consult your local laws and ordinances . <p> Is n't hydrogen flammable ? What about the Hindenburg and the H-bomb ? <p> Hydrogen is flammable , but it is less flammable than gasoline and requires a higher temperature for auto-ignition . Because of hydrogen 's low density , it evaporates quickly , greatly reducing the risk of an explosion if released into the atmosphere . Depending on the type of metal hydride used for storing the hydrogen , different safety precautions must be taken . An ideal metal hydride would , along with its byproducts , be nontoxic , it would also need to have a high ignition temperature and be capable of being safely stored at room temperature and atmospheric pressure . The fear of hydrogen from the Hindenburg disaster and the H-bomb is completely baseless . The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flimsy , aluminum flake containing casing of the hydrogen most likely ignited it . The design and size of the Hindenburg also needs to be kept in mind . A passenger car or fuel cell operating on hydrogen would never have such a large amount of hydrogen stored in a flimsy cloth bag covered with highly conductive metal . Today 's fuel cell systems and hydrogen storage techniques are engineered with safety being a paramount concern . The composite tanks of metal hydride used today to store liquid and gaseous hydrogen are required to undergo rigorous safety testing before they are certified for hydrogen storage . The H-bomb was a thermonuclear weapon containing radioactive hydrogen isotopes forced into nuclear fusion by heat obtained from the nuclear fission of uranium . Only with the presence of a radioactive substance such as uranium undergoing fission , will the hydrogen atoms even come close to being hot enough to even potentially undergo fusion . Even then , H2 and its isotope H3 , or tritium , must both be present . Tritium is extremely rare and breaks up in one millionth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strictly H2 . <p> How do fuel cells fair when compared to other energy production methods ? <p> I already have a renewable energy source for my house , why would I want a fuel cell ? <p> When a solar or wind system is coupled with an electrolyzer , the fuel cell system provides a more efficient , economical and completely renewable source of electricity . By generating hydrogen with a renewable system , the hydrogen becomes a storage medium for the energy contained in the captured sunlight or wind . Hydrogen and the fuel cell are able to replace the toxic , heavy , limited-life batteries currently used as energy storage . Generating hydrogen is non-toxic method to remove the temporal nature of renewable energy systems . <p> Automotive Batteries vs . Fuel Cells for Transportation <p> Vehicles powered by fuel cells combine the attractive advantages of battery-powered cars and the convenience of an internal combustion engine . Fuel cells operate quietly and are zero to low emissions , comparable to a battery-powered vehicle . Fuel cell powered vehicles offer the range , power , responsiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery-powered cars , fuel cells do not require lengthy recharge times and will not transfer the pollution from the tailpipe over the grid to a central generating facility . The batteries used in automobiles are extremely heavy which limits the vehicles range and capacity . The batteries are also composed of toxic materials and have a limited lifetime leading to disposal problems . Fuel cell vehicles operating on pure hydrogen produce only water vapor and heat as emissions while fuel cells reforming fossil fuels into hydrogen would be classified as ultra-low emission vehicles . <p> I have heard that hydrogen burns cleanly , why not replace fossil fuels with hydrogen gas ? <p> Hydrogen , when burned in a combustion engine is a huge improvement in terms of emissions when compared to fossil fuels . Burning hydrogen does release low amounts of nitrous oxide , a component of smog , into the atmosphere . This occurs whenever high temperature combustion occurs in the presence of oxygen . Other pollutants are also released as trace amounts of lubricants are burned in the process . The main reason to employ fuel cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anytime a fuel is ignited and burned the overall efficiency is limited by the laws of physics , especially Carnot 's Law , to around 10% . This is due to efficiency losses associated with heat and the additional steps necessary before the fuel is transformed into usable energy . A fuel cell directly converts the hydrogen fuel into electricity , which is more efficient than hydrogen combustion by cutting out unnecessary steps . <p> What is the amount of hydrogen that is equivalent to a gallon of gasoline ? <p> It would take about 10 Nm3 of hydrogen gas to equal the energy present in 1 gallon of gasoline or 8.3 pounds of coal . <p> Current research and the future of fuel cells . <p> Why are n't fuel cells everywhere ? <p> In the near future , fuel cells will play an increasing role in everyday life . Soon fuel cell powered cars and trucks will be cruising the streets of your town emitting nothing more than harmless water vapor . Fuel cells will find their way into cell phones and laptop computers whose battery life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office will have a fuel cell that replaces a conventional furnace , providing heat and electricity free from the disruptions associated with the utility 's electric grid . Most of the companies planning to manufacture fuel cells are still in the research and development stage of production . Once their systems satisfy the manufacturers ' stringent requirements for performance and safety , the fuel cell systems will be available to the general public . <p> Once transformed into a hydrogen-powered society , will the combined amount of water vapor from fuel cells cause environmental or climate problems ? <p> The Union of Concerned Scientists have issued a report stating that , " If the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet were powered by hydrogen FCVs ( fuel cell vehicles ) , the amount of water emitted annually ( assuming no losses ) would be 0.005% the rate of natural evapotranspiration , water that is released by plants during photosynthesis , in the continental U.S. " <p> Does the United States Government Support Fuel Cell Development ? <p> By supporting the research and development of fuel cells , the United States Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ' competitiveness on the world energy market . Many governmental departments , including the Defense Department , the Department of Energy , and the Department of Transportation have fuel cell programs in their respective areas . All of these programs are leading towards the commercialization of fuel cell technology through partnering with private industry . The Federal Government supports research and development through monetary contributions towards research that is considered risky by industry and by creating the initial markets for expensive new technology . For example , the Climate Change Fuel Cell program provides cost sharing regarding the purchase of a fuel cell system . <p> What are the Benefits of the Federal Government Supporting Fuel Cell Development ? <p> By supporting fuel cell development , the United States Government will achieve the goals of strengthening our national energy security , improving environmental conditions and developing an industry . The United States is dependent on politically unstable and unfriendly regions of the globe for its supply of oil . Currently , the United States imports 50% of its oil . According to the Department of Energy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel cells , with their characteristic fuel flexibility , allow the United States to dramatically reduce its dependence on foreign energy sources and reduce its unbalanced foreign trade debt . By eliminating or greatly reducing the emissions associated with fossil fuels , a noticeable improvement in the environmental conditions in many major metropolitan areas will occur . This results in a reduction of pollution-related medical conditions and a dramatic increase in the quality of life for residents of these areas . <p> What is solar power ? <p> What is solar energy and how is it utilized ? <p> Surprisingly , solar power is actually a utilization of a form of nuclear energy . Our Sun is a main sequence star which creates thermal energy essential to life on Earth . This thermal energy comes from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun 's core . When two hydrogen isotopes combine , they release a helium atom , a freed neutron , and a substantial amount of radiant energy or light . While these rays of light may take anywhere from 10,000 to 170,000 years to reach the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they take roughly 8.3 minutes to reach Earth , where they then provide us with light and warmth , as well as energy for your solar panel to capture and utilize . Solar panels contain crystalline silicon cells or some other semi-conducting agent to convert light energy into electrical energy . <p> What are the strengths and weaknesses of solar power ? <p> While solar energy is essentially free , solar panels are rather large ( for home sized energy collection ) and very expensive . Solar energy collection is 100% environmentally friendly but this is not always the case in regards to the production of solar panels . <p> What is hydro power ? <p> How does hydro power work ? <p> Hydro power is electricity produced from the movement of water . Decent-sized bodies of water , such as streams or rivers with high elevation drops and high currents are the best candidates for hydro power . The current provides substantial energy , which is utilized when water pushes through the paddles of an installed turbine , creating mechanical energy . If hooked up to an electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting mechanical energy to electrical energy . Niagra Falls and the Hoover Dam are two examples of electricity produced in this fashion . <p> What is wind power ? <p> How do we utilize wind power ? <p> Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into mechanical and/or electrical energy . Wind turbines can produce electrical power from mechanical energy , windpumps are used for pumping water or for drainage , and windsails are used to propel and steer sailboats . The most notable and widely used application for collecting and converting wind energy is the wind turbine . China , the U.S. , Germany , Spain and India and several other countries now implement groups of wind turbines , called wind farms , either offshore or onshore to convert wind energy into mechanical and eventually electrical energy . <p> How efficient is wind power ? <p> Wind energy accounted for 2.5% of the world 's energy in 2010 . As of 2011 , Denmark generates approximately one quarter of their electricity from wind energy . <p> What is bioenergy power ? <p> How are biofuels produced ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created from biomass , an organic material acquired from either recently deceased or live organisms . <p> How is bioenergy different from fossil fuels ? <p> Direct biomass combustion actually produces roughly the same amount of carbon dioxide as fossil fuels , but when converted to biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel , their combustion does not produce substantial numbers of carbon emissions in comparison to that of fossil fuels . Biofuels are now being used as fuel additives to reduce carbon emissions and to help lower gasoline prices . Some alternative fuel vehicles will run on predominantly biofuel concentrated blends .

This occurs whenever high temperature combustion occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released as trace amounts of lubricants are burned in the process , yet fuel cells still emit ultra-low pollutants when compared to fossil fuels . The main reason to employ fuel cells instead of combusting hydrogen has to do with efficiency . Anytime a fuel is ignited and burned the overall efficiency is limited by the laws of physics , to around 10% . This is due to efficiency losses associated with heat and the additional steps necessary before the fuel is transformed into usable energy . A fuel cell directly converts the hydrogen fuel into electricity and is therefore inherently more efficient . A fuel cell skips the steps , associated with combustion generation , of first converting the fuel into heat , then mechanical energy and finally into electrical energy . In an automobile engine 100 standard cubic feet of hydrogen would power the car for about 6 to 12 miles . That same amount of hydrogen in a fuel cell powered car could increase the distance traveled from 12 to 24 miles . <h> Hydrogen Has Suffered From Image Problems in The Past <p> Hydrogen is commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen bomb . <p> The exact cause of the Hindenburg fire is still under investigation . In 1937 the Hindenburg was destroyed attempting to land in an electrical storm outside of Lakehurst , NJ . Witnesses reported observing a blue glow on the top of the ill-fated airship . A bluish glow is often indicative of extremely high electrical activity . The current school of thought is that electricity around the flimsy , aluminum flake containing casing of the hydrogen most likely ignited it . <p> The design and size of the Hindenburg also needs to be kept in mind . A passenger car or fuel cell operating on hydrogen would never have such a large amount of hydrogen stored in a flimsy cloth bag covered with highly conductive metal . Today 's fuel cell systems and hydrogen storage techniques are engineered with safety being a paramount concern . The composite tanks used to store liquid and gaseous hydrogen are required to undergo rigorous safety testing before they are certified for hydrogen storage . <p> Hydrogen gas has also received negative press in the past because of its relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen will only fuse under extremely high heat and pressures that would never be found in a fuel cell system or hydrogen storage device . <p> Remember , the H-bomb was a thermonuclear weapon containing radioactive hydrogen isotopes forced into nuclear fusion by heat obtained from the nuclear fission of uranium . Only with the presence of a radioactive substance such as uranium undergoing fission , will the hydrogen atoms even come close to being hot enough to even potentially undergo fusion . Even then , H2 and its isotope H3 , or tritium , must both be present . Tritium is extremely rare and breaks up in one millionth of a second . The hydrogen used in fuel cell energy is strictly H2 . <h> Hydrogen Versus a Gallon of Gasoline <p> It would take about 10 Nm3 of hydrogen gas to equal the energy present in 1 gallon of gasoline or 8.3 pounds of coal . <p> The Union of Concerned Scientists have issued a report stating that , " If the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet were powered by hydrogen FCVs ( fuel cell vehicles ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would be 0.005% the rate of water that is released by plants during photosynthesis , in the continental U.S. " <p> Below are example calculations for determining the cost of operating a 1kW fuel cell on hydrogen . In these examples a compressed hydrogen cylinder with a capacity of 196 cubic feet of hydrogen at normal temperature and pressure ( NTP ) is used . The purity of hydrogen consumed is 99.99999% . <p> Costs : Example 1 The cost of operating a 1kW fuel cell for 7.26 hours when only one cylinder is purchased per month is $134 . This is equivalent to $18.40 per hour to operate at one kilowatt . <p> Costs : Example 2 When the number of hydrogen cylinders used is increased , then the cost is reduced . Assuming that 5 cylinders of hydrogen are consumed in one month , this gives 7.26 x 5 = 36.33 hours of operation . The cost of the cylinders is ( 5 x $100 ) + ( 5 x $14 ) + $20 = $590 . This is equivalent to $16.24 per hour to operate at one kilowatt .

@@6810136 @10136/ <h> Article Search <h> Fuel Cell Characterization <p> Different characterization techniques enable the quantitative comparison of every property and part of the fuel cell stack . By characterizing the fuel cell properly , you can understand why the fuel cell is performing well or poorly . These techniques help discriminate between activation , ohmic and concentration losses , fuel crossover , and defective materials . In-situ testing is important because the performance of the fuel cell can not be determined simply by characterizing its parts . Not only can the actual parts cause performance losses -- but the contact between the parts can also cause decreased performance in fuel cells . <p> Fuel Cell Testing Setup <p> If you have limited access to test equipment , you can begin testing fuel cells with a multimeter , a temperature/humidity monitor for the room , and an oscilloscope . This only provides limited information about the fuel cell system -- but it will be enough to begin your initial examination . A good test setup with many methods of monitoring different fuel cell and fuel properties allows you to control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parameters that can be monitored are the fuel temperatures , pressures , and flow rates . <p> Mass flow controllers , pressure gauges , and thermocouples help to monitor the fuel cell operating conditions . A potentiostat/galvanostat and impedance analyzer can help accurately track the electrical performance of the fuel cell . Some of the experiments that can be conducted include polarization testing , current interrupt tests , and cyclic voltammetry . An appropriate test setup can help accurately characterize most fuel cell parameters and operating conditions . <p> To test a fuel cell correctly , the test setup needs to be verified , the cell conditioned , and baseline testing conditions and operating parameters must be established . After the testing setup has been completed , accurate tracking of the temperature , pressure , flow rates , and other operating conditions need to be monitored throughout the testing process . <p> Verification of the Assembly <p> The person performing the testing must verify that the fuel cell is seated correctly in the test apparatus . This should be done before any fuel cell is tested because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oxygen . Hazards are eliminated by checking the test apparatus through visual inspection and pressure and leakage tests for the hydrogen , oxygen , coolant , and other chemicals . To ensure a safe environment , it is usually a good idea to have a hydrogen and oxygen sensor in the lab environment . The instrumentation also needs to be adequately installed and correctly connected to the data acquisition system to generate the expected fuel cell test data . <p> Fuel Cell Conditioning <p> Before fuel cell testing is performed , the cell must be adequately conditioned . Many fuel cells ( depending upon the fuel cell type ) begin providing power within seconds or minutes of supplying fuel . However , to test accurately and consistently , a procedure should be developed and used for the startup and conditioning of the cell before it is tested . Several methods exist for starting the fuel cell , and cell voltage , current , and other operating parameters should always be recorded during fuel cell testing . <p> Baseline Test Conditions and Operating Parameters <p> A baseline set of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel cell tests . This baseline is a function of the hardware being tested , the test facility , and the operating conditions . A baseline set of conditions should be established for the following : <p> These baseline conditions should be carefully studied and documented during the testing process , and are described briefly in the remainder of this post . <p> Temperature <p> The fuel cell temperature must be documented and maintained throughout the fuel cell tests . At a minimum , the inlet and outlet temperatures should be monitored in addition to the fuel cell stack itself . To determine how the fuel cell could be improved , the temperatures across the fuel cell stack and in each cell should be monitored . Any inconsistencies in temperature can alter the fuel cell performance . <p> Pressure <p> Gas pressures are typically monitored at the fuel inlets and outlets using pressure transducers to determine the amount of pressure drop that occurred within the fuel cell stack . Increasing the fuel cell pressure may improve cell performance , but the system should be studied to determine how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system design is optimal for increased pressures . <p> Flow Rate <p> Flow rates can be monitored using mass flow controllers . The fuel cell performance can be studied using by maintaining the same flow rate , and ramping the flow rates up or down and recording the resulting fuel cell parameters . <p> Compression Force <p> For most bipolar fuel cell stack configurations , there is an optimal compression force that helps the fuel cell achieve the best performance . Cells with low compression forces can suffer from increased ohmic loss , while cells that have high compression forces can suffer from pressure or concentration losses . <p> Conclusion <p> Fuel cell characterization techniques allow comparison of almost every characteristic of every part of the fuel cell stack . Selecting the best characterization technique , or using a combination of them , will provide you information about why the fuel cell is performing well or poorly .
