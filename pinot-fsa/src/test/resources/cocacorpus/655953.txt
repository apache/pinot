@@109788638 @5188638/ <p> Behavior tracking programs allow teachers to track the classroom conduct of individual students and reward or punish it accordingly . Probably the most popular example is Class Dojo , but all behavior tracking education technology follows a similar formula : Students are awarded points for good behavior and- these accumulated points are usually paired with some kind of extrinsic reward by the educator . Most of the behavior tracking programs send messages to students parents and some even offer language translation . These enticing features explain why some educators embrace behavior tracking education technology . <h> Pros of Behavior Tracking Education Technology <h> 1 . Cultivating Relationships with Parents <p> By allowing educators to easily inform parents of their students conduct , behavior tracking education technology facilitates a synergy between the class environment and the home environment , the two pillars of the learning process .

The goal was simple : to better prepare these children for kindergarten . <p> Today , as tech begins to dominate our lives , we can easily build off of that model and institute tech-based solutions to address educational disparities in low-income neighborhoods . We believe that there are three ways early childhood ed tech programs can help low-income students succeed . <h> 3 Benefits of Early Childhood Ed Tech : <p> 1 . Accessibility <p> According to a 2015 survey , nearly two-thirds of Americans ( 64% ) own a smartphone . And while laptops and tablets have become ubiquitous , for a fraction of low-income students , the internet is solely accessible via smartphones . Educational apps designed specifically for smartphones circumvent the issue of accessibility that can hinder early childhood education . <p> 2 . Cost <p> With the average cost of preschool increasing , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early childhood development programs . As more children from middle-class families attend preschool , those with lower incomes start kindergarten at a disadvantage . However , because of the wide range of apps across platforms , it is possible for lower-income families to find cheap or even free educational alternatives online that emphasize the basics . <p> 3. - Facilitating Development <p> Early childhood ed tech can help to shrink the educational and digital divides that plague many children from low-income families . This , in turn , improves their chances of social mobility going forward , as they are more prepared to use technology in high school , college and the digital workplace . <p> Education has always been a game of resources : Those with more receive a better one . By implementing tech-based solutions such as educational apps , we can not only increase the number of resources available to children from low-income families , but better prepare them for the ever-evolving digital workplace . 
@@109788643 @5188643/ <h> Increasing teacher productivity <p> If there 's one thing that todays educators would like to change about their profession , its the feeling that there is n't enough time in the day to get everything done . By the time the students are settled in and the agenda of the day is discussed , five or ten minutes have already passed . By the end of the school year , teachers often talk about having to cut an important lesson from the course entirely , only because time would n't allow it . <p> What this boils down to , essentially , is that daily classroom responsibilities stall teacher productivity . Teachers juggle a lot , focus much of their time on administrative tasks and find that they ca n't cover all the material they desire . Students do n't  learn the material fast enough , or struggle to complete projects in a reasonable amount of time . Let 's face it : teacher productivity is a struggle . <p> For too long , educators have accepted this as just another part of the job . The belief that teacher productivity ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of daily classroom life , is widespread . Educators should be flexible , after all , as its extremely difficult to teach students new material . Why move on to the next lesson if students have n't yet grasped the current one ? <p> These teacher productivity challenges have caused nearly 50 percent of teachers to leave the classroom within the first five years of their career . Liz Riggs explains this phenomenon in her article " Why Do Teachers Quit ? " She writes , " The revolving door of teacher turnover is a problem that affects students and entire schools . " <p> What if it does n't  have to be this way ? As it turns out , many of the teacher productivity problems that have plagued teachers for decades can be solved or significantly helped with digital tools . <h> Not Enough Time for In-Class Activities <p> When it comes to teacher productivity problems , the worst thing that happens is when teachers manage to engage their students in a passionate discussion , only to have that discussion cut short by time . According to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Teaching and Learning , students prefer a " more active pedagogical approach " in the classroom , such as discussion or group-based learning activities . Unfortunately , teachers only have so much time in a class period to organize these activities . <p> Thanks to LiveTiles Mosaic , students and teachers can use Office 365 applications and cloud-based services to enhance teacher productivity and continue these exciting discussions outside of class on social networks like Yammer . <p> Yammer , as seen in the screenshot below , is like Facebook for the classroom " a space where anyone with authorization can share important information . Teachers can use Yammer to delve deeper into a discussion that happened in class , or reiterate a point that may have been missed by the students . <p> In other words , by adopting the digital classroom , teachers can finally stay on schedule . Rather than have to cancel the next days lesson plans to re-explain a topic that was n't fully comprehended the first time , teachers can go over this topic on Yammer and answer any questions about it after class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present for this , and students can just communicate with themselves in the digital classroom space . Yammer is a surefire way to increase teacher productivity . <h> Wasting Time with Classroom Management <p> Teachers often have to make important announcements at the beginning or end of class , cutting into crucial activities . A lot of time is spent on basic classroom management or other housekeeping , and these mundane but necessary tasks hinder teacher productivity . <p> To overcome this teacher productivity obstacle , teachers can use Mosaic to add the Office 365 Calendar tool , and post important announcements like an upcoming test or the due date of a project . This way , every student in the class , regardless of who is present in class on a given day , will see the message , and class time can be spent doing more productive work . <p> In addition , so much time is wasted on handing out assignments . As unbelievable as it may seem , too many teachers today rely on the fax machine and photocopier . These outmoded tools only slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about increasing teacher productivity , they ought to make the paperless transition to the digital classroom . Rather than print and photocopy materials and spend at least ten minutes handing these materials out in class and explaining them , teachers can upload these materials onto OneNote . <p> As the screenshot below illustrates , a simple click of a button will share course content with students , who can then access this content at their own convenience . Mosaic positively impacts teacher productivity by making anytime , anywhere learning a reality once and for all . <p> Source : LiveTiles Mosaic <p> As one study in the European Journal of Education Studies puts it , " Both teachers and students have a significant role to play when it comes to implementing effective classroom management . " A simple step to increasing teacher productivity would be to transfer the mundane classroom management minutiae online and expect students to check into the digital classroom on a regular basis . <h> Difficulty Tracking Grades <p> Perhaps the most pervasive teacher productivity problem is the common complaint that grading takes too long . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they can significantly speed up the process and see a surge in teacher productivity . <p> In the traditional classroom , teachers would have to write student grades down on a notebook and store them in a file cabinet somewhere . As you can imagine , storing a bunch of scattered papers in a messy file cabinet does n't  exactly help teacher productivity . We can only wonder how many grades were lost , and how many students were angry " not to mention all the time it took to find these grades for future reference . <p> Mosaic solves this teacher productivity problem by letting teachers add tools like OneNote and OneDrive to the digital classroom . <p> here 's how it works : Teachers can use digital inking to grade their students OneNote assignments , and use the record voice feature to offer important feedback . These grades can then be stored in the Cloud and accessed by students on OneDrive anytime , from anywhere , so that they can measure their progress in real-time . These cloud-based technologies improve teacher productivity because teachers will not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dissertation for Harvard University , Adam Lowell confirms the importance of online grading . He explains , " Allowing students online access to their grades significantly impacts their mastery goal orientation . " That is , this seemingly small shift in procedure can significantly enhance the learning experience for students . Not only do teachers create a transparent relationship with their students and provide feedback in a timely manner , they free up their hours for more important tasks . Teacher productivity will improve if teachers spend less time tracking grades . <p> Its important to keep in mind that the digital classroom does n't  replace teachers or do their jobs for them , nor does it solve all the teacher productivity problems in the world . At the end of the day , we still need highly qualified educators to engage the young minds of tomorrow , and teachers will still have to work hard at this . Technology , for all its benefits , can only do so much . <p> However , teacher productivity is a real challenge , and rather than accept the status quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By embracing digital tools and making a few changes in practice and procedure , educators can once and for all focus on what theyve always wanted : teaching their students . 
@@109788647 @5188647/ <h> How to create a SharePoint practice <p> Microsoft SharePoint is probably the most widely used collaboration platform for teams to share information such as , documents , calendars , tasks and any ad hoc information they might have . Its used by companies of all sizes to help their business to operate more efficiently . It serves as a depository for files and documents in an organization . It is a major flagship product for Microsoft Office in that it is one of the more popular applications in the Office 365 suite . As such , it could be largely beneficial for organizations to create a SharePoint practice . <p> " People do n't  know what it SharePoint is . SharePoint is a lot like a piece of wood , a hammer and nails . There are so many things you can do with it . Its a toolset to create and replicate optimal business practices " Karl Redenbach , CEO , LiveTiles <h> Why Build a SharePoint Practice ? <p> So its quite apparent that perhaps building a SharePoint practice would do a great deal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional infrastructure services like Exchange that many systems integrators have focused on over the last 20-30 years . Typically , most partners have made their revenue from updating infrastructure and hardware , and placing software on physical servers . <p> There are a couple of key factors affecting how partners are approaching infrastructure evolution " the first is the cloud , meaning that hardware and other physical services migrated to the cloud no longer need updates . <p> Business is shrinking because of the cloud and the services that systems integrators are providing around the cloud are quickly becoming a commodity . SharePoint will give companies not only a profitable and high margin business , but it will also future-proof your business in that you will be able to continually evolve your strategies and services as technology changes , and thereby provide real value added solutions to your customers . You can provide high value services at high margins and meet customers needs without much risk involved . <h> The Key Components in Knowing How to Create a SharePoint Practice <p> So you 've read up to this point and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you need to know to start building your own SharePoint practice ? <p> SharePoint is effectively made up of a couple of key areas . It is a web-based intranet portal , meaning it is used internally by members of a company . <p> The first and main component of SharePoint is document management . Traditionally , people have had files shares and shared servers that have had no structure . For example , in the H drive , or the file share of an organization , information and documents are stored in folder after folder , maybe 20 folders deep . Let 's say the last folder is called the " Bob " folder . No one knows what the " Bob " folder contains . Only Bob would know . Bob has n't  worked for the company for five years " however the contents of that folder may still be relevant to the company . SharePoint allows you to categorize these documents in a simple and friendly way so that when retrieving information , it is easy to find the documents you need . SharePoint incorporates things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside normal folder structures , and makes them easier to access . <p> The next component is effective search capabilities " being able to search and find things like Human Resources documents and employee contact information quickly and easily is a crucial aspect of SharePoint as an intranet service . Also important here are forms . Where you have forms employees need to fill out for things like leads , expenses , and HR , SharePoint automates them and produces workflows around them to facilitate a mundane process . <p> SharePoint can also compile and store business intelligence , or data analytics , another crucial component that provides rich information on your business . This can include information on finance , sales , or accounts and have it all in this secured and easily searchable web-based portal . <p> So , essentially building a SharePoint practice will include all of these components to better assist your organization in deploying business solutions . By creating a SharePoint practice , you can encompass all of the Microsoft applications that your company utilizes to create a simplified business strategy that both motivates employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to create further business and increased monetization . <h> Creating SharePoint Sites <p> One major component of creating a SharePoint practice is the act of creating a site . A SharePoint site is the collection of pages , lists and document libraries " composed of several different categories , they are the foundation of company intranets . Previously , creating a site was done by very skilled SharePoint administrators , many of which have had many years of training and experience . <p> To create a SharePoint site you must be a member of a site group . If authorized by company , one would then need to access the settings page , and then follow 14 or 15 steps and would eventually provide you with a vessel to begin storing information . <p> An important fact to know when creating a SharePoint site is that there are Microsoft partner organizations creating software that can greatly facilitate this time and resource consuming process of building a SharePoint architecture . For example , LiveTiles has created a software product which allows SharePoint administrators to easily design a smooth user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SharePoint practice by cutting down the amount of time one spends rearranging existing information architecture into a page . <p> Typically when creating sites , there are two key people involved ; an administrator and a developer authorized by the company . However , in many cases when building a SharePoint practice , a consultant with IT experience will take ownership of this duty . If it is a larger organization , there is an IT consultant in each department within that company whom is responsible for creating sites , pages , libraries , etc . If the organization is on the smaller side , there is usually one IT specialist . This is usually limits site authorship and administrative access to only a handful of people , depending on the size of the organization . However , when using products like LiveTiles that rely on drag and drop and natural language tools , no specific technical knowledge is required to create sites and pages . This allows you to maximize your IT resources where they are truly necessary , instead of mundane tasks like creating pages , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using LiveTiles Design <p> SharePoint homepage made using LiveTiles Design <h> How to Create a SharePoint Practice <p> Now let 's explore how to effectively create a SharePoint practice . SharePoint creates a one-stop shop to get information and share information from anywhere at anytime with anyone . What 's better is that it is part of the Microsoft family of products which is used by many businesses " small and large " whether its Exchange for email or Active Directory for security or Skype for Business . This means SharePoint can fit neatly alongside solutions like Office365 that you may be already advertising to your customers . <p> One way or the other , building a SharePoint team is a good way to build a SharePoint practice . A SharePoint team will typically consist of four representatives . There 's a sales person , a project coordinator , a SharePoint consultant and a more technical person . Having skilled IT professionals within the company to fill the technical role in a SharePoint team can really round out teams that that are able to effectively harness all the functions SharePoint has to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practice is conducting SharePoint workshops . Workshops will implement strategies to educate and inform new users on SharePoint best practices , and go hand in hand with user adoption of SharePoint . User adoption is also an important step in the process of creating a SharePoint practice , Conducting focus groups , having staff members test the solution , and encouraging feedback inspires forward thinking . <p> Finally , using third party products " like LiveTiles " to build a SharePoint practice can allow you to build out your SharePoint practice that can accommodate and appeal to customers who are n't  necessarily SharePoint experts and enhance their collaborative capabilities . <p> So , these are good tools to get started with to cultivate a SharePoint practice in your organization . Creating a SharePoint practice does not have to be a major hassle " it is merely an amazing tool to help business users in this new world to do their job better .

Most survivors believe that we must acknowledge the mass genocide of six million Jews so that we- do n't  let similar events happen again . Well , since Adolf Hitler established a systematic method to " purify " Nazi Germany , we 've had Cambodia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Darfur . Its easy to say " never forget , " but these are just words until we rid the world of the kind of intolerance Hitlers regime represented . <p> Still , its important to remember , so that we understand the human faces of the Holocaust . Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day , in which schools around the world will remember the millions who died in the Holocaust , as well as the many more who survived . <p> Technology has impacted the classroom in numerous ways , including how teachers present this important information to students . We believe that digital tools make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Holocaust , and have come up with creative ways that educators can use technology to teach about this important chapter in human history . <p> A Catholic school in Minnesota recently broadcasted Holocaust survivor Steen Metzs story to their student body , and they used video conferencing software Skype to make this happen . Many survivors are elderly and unable to travel , or live in different places throughout the world . Skype enables survivors to share their testimonies anyway . <p> At universities around the world , there are highly respected academics who specialize in Holocaust Studies . What if a high school teacher wanted one of these academics to share important information to her students , but could n't get the academic to come in person ? Periscope is a live streaming app that would allow this academic to present a guest lecture from a separate location . <p> One way to teach about the Holocaust is to have a group of students create a memorial . Collaboration software like OneNote will allow them to share important information outside of class . <p> Source : https : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Readings <p> Of course , students should read the canonical texts of the Holocaust , but this wont be enough .

Take a Virtual Tour of Holocaust Museums <p> While it would be ideal to take students to Holocaust museums , some schools do n't  have the budget , and others are just too far away . Rather than give up all together , teachers can arrange virtual tours of museums , like The Holocaust Memorial Center in Michigan . <p> Want your students to present an important Holocaust topic that was n't covered in class ?

@@109788659 @5188659/ <h> Communication infrastructure : languages of the digital workplace <h> The Call For Community <p> The digital workplace can often mean isolation , in the sense that there will be one employee in their personal office ( or bedroom ) sitting silently before the glow of their laptop screen . An employee could sometimes go weeks or months- without seeing- their other coworkers . This means establishing a well managed communication infrastructure throughout the digital workplace , for use by employees that work from home or the office , is absolutely critical . <p> The basis of a well run communication infrastructure requires personnel to be on the same page as far as what communication devices they will be using . If a group of employees prefer to primarily email while another group prefers to use company pages on social media like Yammer or Facebook , then there will be a disconnect in the digital workplace . The problem with the modern digital workplace is that there are almost an absurd number of alternative forms of communication that do n't require an employee to so much as open their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many communication options , is that depending on the digital workplace , an employee 's workload , or any one project a company 's working on , there is n't a single mode of communication that is undeniably better than the other . When managing a digital workplace that allows employees to work from any location , the need to highlight what methods of communication are ideal for each task/department is crucial . <h> The Basics : Establishing an easy to use Intranet <p> The backbone of all digital workplaces is their intranet . For a wide variety of companies with different backgrounds , - LiveTiles- is a great option when it comes to having an intranet that can be designed and continuously customized themselves , which are vital features when developing your communication infrastructure. - Your intranet should be more than a simple hub where employees can access company information . You should- evoke your company 's unique personality into the format and UX of your intranet , as this strategy will set principles that define the very concept of your company 's digital workplace. - A well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an employee will need to speedily access . The point is that an employee can get in and get out , without having to scroll through needless menus and links . Once a proper intranet like the LiveTiles digital workplace featured below has been established , you can continue to develop your communication infrastructure by tackling more specific and diverse features . <h> Manually Unifying Devices <p> When managing and creating the digital workplace , it 's not necessarily the employee 's job to make sure everyone 's devices are in sync . A rather unique strategy of coordinating communication in the digital workplace is best exemplified by Yahoo. - Recently , they gave all of their full and part time employees a selection of smartphones from the iPhone to Samsung to choose from , while also covering their data and phone bills . In addition to boosting employee satisfaction and morale , this also allows employees to become familiar with the devices customers are using , creating a more in sync workforce that can better design the company 's mobile services and marketing strategy . While such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an intriguing concept that could be expanded upon depending on the specific intentions of your company . <h> Discipline <p> Employees need to be- educated- on what constitutes as professional communication in the digital workplace . While of course , it should be obvious that personal information should never be pinging across the alerts of one 's fellow employees , there are a number of far less apparent ways the communication infrastructure of the digital workplace can be abused . Again , the issue of highlighting what the criteria for using certain communications methods will be , is essential , but its just as important to ensure that employees know- how- to communicate . <p> When communicating- online , impersonal habits like glaring typos , slang and improper message format/composition can not only cause an employee to appear less professional , but also cause misinterpretations among other employees that of course can crescendo into wasted time and resources . In the work place , personal friendships can ( and should ) form that may result in employees dropping the formality when communicating with one another . While a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale that comes with communicating across the web makes this a risky threat . However , banning employees from speaking freely to one another should n't be considered as a viable option . Instead , it 's beneficial to acknowledge this potential area of error and then give your employees the benefit of the doubt ( after explaining the threat of online miscommunication , of course ) only calling back on close employee communication if mistakes begin to arise . <p> Miscommunication , regardless of employee misbehavior , can arise just from the simplicity that comes with the benefit of virtual communications . For example , simply using an exclamation point in a sentence can lead to multiple different interpretations without precise context . Proper digital workplace governance is necessary here in establishing the complications that can arise from seemingly little , harmless communicative touches . Making sure an employee is aware of these misinterpretations should add a sense of critical thinking that wo n't allow these mix-ups to be much of a common occurrence . <p> Utilizing a digital workplace only communication tool like Yammer is also a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because while it replicates the feel of a typical social media site , employees of are never lulled away from the idea that they are still engaged with the digital workplace community . <h> Secure <h> - Communications <p> When managing a communication infrastructure , it 's important to consistently monitor the conversations going on between your employees , whether through the intranet or social media or group emails . Security issues mostly concern hazardous websites and outside sources that an employee can accidentally tap into , rather than any maliciousness intent on the employee 's behalf. - Closely monitoring- the communications of employees can unfortunately enter a grey area of scrutiny . If its deemed necessary to protect sensitive data , then immediately giving your employees a detailed list of how they 're communications through the digital workplace will be monitored is necessary to dispel any uneasy opinions employees have on the policy .

With personal preference aside , for video communication Skype is a safe bet for conducting conferences with potential clients . Utilizing video conferences is preferable by- 70%- of people as opposed to a physical meeting ( which requires travel expenses/time consumption . ) A meeting via a video conference does n't lose any of the face-to-face meeting 's benefits when compared to a phone call , which maintains non-verbal communication ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement . <p> Video conferencing also provides the benefit of personally engaging with employees that work from home , breaking down distance barriers which will help form a stronger work relationship .

As with all streaming technology , possible connectivity hiccups can occur and it 's best to have a backup plan set aside when predetermining how much time will be allotted to any particular meeting . <h> Do n't Forget The Telephone <p> Just hearing the word telephone makes you feel as though you 've been hurled a decade or so into the past , does n't it ? In the bustling world of communication advancements , its easy to forget about the most basic ability there is . Communicating via actually speaking over our smartphones may seem archaic , but it still remains a vital form of communication that should n't be written off . When communicating via a keyboard , a necessary touch of personality is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple of conversations . Communicating via the phone should always be utilized for serious discussions , especially because no email , text , or chat message is received faster than the spoken word .

Judging the necessity of speaking via the phone is as mandatory as any other mode of communication . <p> An alternative to simply communicating via the phone is by utilizing speech to text- software . Utilizing a digital workplace like- LiveTiles- can implement this service through APIs and store it on your company 's intranet . <h> There is No Single Way to Say Hello <p> Priority is key when organizing the communication 's infrastructure of your digital workplace .

Remember , while the digital workplace is accessible for millennials , older generations and employees otherwise unfamiliar with this process- will need the community- as a whole to transition in these changes and policies . When it comes to establishing a communication infrastructure in the digital workplace , regardless of the device , it 's what 's being said that matters . 
@@109788660 @5188660/ <h> What is the digital classroom ? <p> The digital revolution is n't upon us " it already happened . Digital technology impacts every aspect of our lives , from how we communicate to where we find information . This technology disrupts the status quo and transforms individuals and institutions , and there are right and wrong ways to respond . <p> This is never clearer than in the classroom . Ever since the advent of the smart phone , teachers have been debating the merits of education technology . Some believe that it can make the learning experience more exciting and engaging , and others fear that it will distract students . At the center of these arguments is a general lack of understanding of what , exactly , the digital classroom is and why it matters to todays educators . <h> The Traditional Classroom Is Dead <p> Whether you teach at an established private school or a newly opened charter , chances are that you 're going to face similar challenges . All educators struggle to engage their students with captivating assignments . Every teacher out there wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student engagement , but they are unable to do so because effective classroom management is essential to student success . <p> According to Bobby Taylor of Jackson State University , classroom management " determines the failure or success of student achievement . " If the classroom is disorganized and students are unruly , teachers will spent more time acting like disciplinarians than dispensers of knowledge . <p> These universal challenges are magnified by an inconvenient truth for many educators , especially those who have been teaching for decades : The traditional classroom is dead . <p> This is n't just a catchy slogan , either . Traditional education , which placed an emphasis on oral recitation , rote memorization and corporal punishment , has been replaced by alternative approaches . These alternative approaches put students first , and prioritize collaborative classroom activities and comprehension above all else . <p> There are a number of reasons why the traditional classroom has gone out of style . Some of this has to do with changes in culture and society . Frankly , its no longer acceptable in many developed nations for teachers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part , the days of nuns hitting disobedient students with a ruler are over . <p> At the same time , education experts have come to the near unanimous conclusion that alternative approaches teach students more successfully , and that the traditional classroom is not a productive space for students to learn . It might be easier for an educator to sit in front of a group of students all day and regurgitate the same lecture , but this does n't  guide students to grasp the information theyll need to be successful . <p> According to a study published in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ( PNAS ) , students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail . This study evaluates undergraduate performance in STEM courses , and it confirms a growing consensus amongst education experts across the board : Traditional approaches to education are ineffective . <p> It seems logical , then , that teachers would adopt alternative approaches to education . Out of all the alternative approaches available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Digital Classroom , Anyway ? <p> The digital classroom is a collaborative space where teachers , students and technology can co-exist in harmony . More sophisticated than an intranet , the digital classroom can be easily designed by LiveTiles Mosaic , a free education solution that allows any school with an Office 365 tenant to create collaborative , touch-friendly digital classrooms in the Cloud . <p> Mosaic , as seen in the screenshot below , enables educators to create interactive learning spaces via LiveTiles user-friendly drag and drop functionality , and allow teachers and students to share and store important learning materials that can be accessed anytime on any device by anyone with authorization . <p> This means , for example , that if a student is sick and must stay home from school , he or she can upload an important assignment to the digital classroom , and post a message asking students what , if any , valuable information was missed . No more make-up work , and no more copying a classmates illegible hand-written notes . <p> Teachers , as well , can upload reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central database for student grades that can be accessed in the digital classroom and even interact with other teachers to develop the most effective lesson plans for the digital classroom . No more photocopies , and no more messy file cabinets . <p> While the digital classroom inherently favors technology integration into the classroom , it does n't  undermine the important role that human beings play . Technology will not replace teachers in the digital classroom , it will make their jobs easier . Digital tools will not do the work for students in the digital classroom , it will help students do their work more efficiently . In other words , the digital classroom will improve the learning process by bringing students and teachers together in unprecedented ways . <p> However , the digital classroom does n't  just bring teachers and students together . It also brings developing countries into the 21st century . With widely used productivity applications such as OneNote , Sway , Word , Excel and PowerPoint and cloud-based services like OneDrive , Yammer and SharePoint , Mosaic allows students and educators around the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge the digital divide that has separated rich and poor , industrialized nation and third-world country for decades . <p> Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development puts it best when he proclaims , " Technology wasnt developed as a development tool yet has become one of the greatest vehicles for change . Young people are natural adopters of new technologies and certainly the potential for technology and digital media to be a force for innovation , education and change is just beginning to be realized . " <p> More than an agent of technological or even cultural change , though , the digital classroom revolutionizes pedagogical practices and reinvents the education paradigm . By the very nature of the digital apps , the digital classroom will become a more collaborative space , as teachers and students can use Mosaic to complete interactive projects . Modern multimedia from Ted Talks to digital books will take the place of lectures and dry readings , and will help facilitate discussion and improve communication skills . <p> As education expert William J. McKeachie explains in his book McKeachies Teaching Tips : Strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If instructors expect students to learn how to integrate , apply , and think , it seems reasonable that students should have an opportunity to practice these skills . To help students learn and think , you need to find out what is in their heads . " <h> The Digital Classroom is the Future <p> There are some teachers out there who have abandoned many aspects of traditional education . For example , teachers are increasingly seeing the benefits of hands-on collaborative activates , and often assign group projects to their students . Their intentions are noble , but the transition away from the traditional classroom is n't complete until teachers embrace the digital classroom . <p> Teachers should join the digital classroom for reasons beyond the basic educational benefits . It goes without saying that alternative approaches to education that integrate technology into the classroom will significantly enhance the learning experience . More than that , the digital classroom meets todays tech-savvy generation where they are , while at the same time , expands digital access to those who are n't  up to speed with the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators should agree , its that the classroom must prepare students for a career " what some refer to as " the real world . " <p> Many industries are starting to adopt a digital workplace , and expect their employees to be familiar with the latest cloud-based technologies and Office 365 apps . There are statistics that show the success gap between those who have access to digital technology and possess digital literacy skills and those who do n't  . <p> A March 2016 Council of Economic Advisers brief , to provide just one example , reports that " unemployed workers in households with Internet were 4 percentage points more likely to be employed one month in the future than those households without Internet . " In other words , access to and knowledge of digital technology lead to better labor market outcomes . <p> With this in mind , it is the educators responsibility to familiarize students with technology . This means that educators should teach students how to use technology so that it can make them more productive , and not overwhelm and distract them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , the digital classroom should teach students how to navigate todays tricky technological terrain so that they become capable members of tomorrows digital workforce .

On a team site home page , you can view links to important team files , apps , and web pages and see recent site activity in the activity feed . <p> Now that we have that squared away , how about we explore how to maximize your use of SharePoint as collaboration software ? <h> Organize Your Team <p> SharePoint team sites can be used for effective project management by culling task timelines , project-specific documents , calendars , manpower , and more into their own specific sites that are easy to access for all parties involved . <h> Capitalize on Workflows <p> SharePoint workflows are types of applications that automate and expedite a number of business processes that include , but are not limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take care of all the tedious in-between-work , your team saves manpower , time , and money by redirecting those resources into the bigger undertakings . <h> Recycle What You 've Built <p> SharePoint wikis , lists , and libraries are instrumental in digital teamwork because it provides a highly accessible means for sharing information . When establishing the setup for these archives , it is beneficial to create Site Columns rather than making your columns in a specific list set. - This makes your columns a part of the entire site instead of just that particular document , meaning , it becomes reusable in all of the lists and libraries that fall under that site and its subsites . You can set up Site Columns through the site settings window . <p> To really go green with SharePoint , once you 've set up your site with all the bells and whistles that you need , it could prove useful to make a template of that site . A good setup is a good setup , and once that site of yours enters the Solutions Gallery , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering that SharePoint allows for document cooperation and sharing locally or in a browser , those sites that are given a second , third , fourth , etc life become invaluable because of the exponential time they can save down the line . <h> Communicate Innovatively <p> Naturally , most team collaboration tools come about with communication in mind . In SharePoint , there are profiles and newsfeeds available that update organizations on individuals and events in a manner that is similar to what many social media outlets do . When LiveTiles is incorporated , even third-party app integration for staying in contact with your team is made simple. - Yammer is ready to go out of the box , and it provides a clean , efficient venue for sharing ideas and images in a forum-type space . Plus , it comes without all of that cold formality that tends to be inherent in emails . Part of working well in a group stems from keeping interactions light and developing a level of comfort and rapport through that levity . <h> Connect the Dots in Data <p> Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when its qualities are interconnected with the qualities of other pieces of data for search and UX purposes . To swiftly find files , store information with metadata to tag common words for a quick yielding . When it comes to larger divisions of data , clustering entire sites together with a collection site could prove useful . Collection sites take a root site that acts as the parent site to smaller subsites that deal in a common theme . Any groups or features made in the root can easily trickle into the others within its tree for speedy maintenance . <h> Keep it Simple <p> One of the last practices to best use a SharePoint team site for collaboration is to keep things simple. - The information architecture is already there , and although you can customize quite a bit , an awful lot can be done right away without any front-end code . When you bring in LiveTiles that statement holds even more truth . The thing is " you 're set from the get-go and should n't try doing anything too crazy that might already be attainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire mission of collaboration software is to streamline any kind of effort on the user 's part . If your workspace becomes jumbled and confusing , it wo n't do anyone any favors . Put SharePoint portals where they should be , follow a logical progression of what an average user might anticipate , and arrange all of this in a pleasing way . Function is great , but form goes a long way too . <p> SharePoint is a versatile tool that helps you and your team get work done in the digital workplace . There is quite a bit to take in because of its flexibility , but if you stick to the general practices listed above , you 'll stay on the right track . LiveTiles makes staying on that track a lot easier because of its ability to pair up with SharePoint 's programming and make it even simpler to update and maintain sites across the board from anywhere and in real time .

All hands on deck ! Hard to starboard ! Land ho ! <p> That 's all the nautical lingo this author knows . The analogy would be done more justice by a more experienced sailor anyway . The point is , like sailors , business owners must navigate their vessel through changing conditions ; their fate depends on their vigilance and ability to recognize signs of trouble ( or opportunity ) . <p> Like with sailing , the tools that help business owners make informed decisions have improved . Whereas captains once depended on astrolabes but now have GPS , business owners who relied on business intelligence using- past data can now use big data analyticsand visualization tools to obtain real-time insights on business performance . <p> As captains have a dashboard of controls in the bow , a business owner needs a central location to view their company 's performance . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators shows how well your company is responding to real-time market conditions . Without further ado , here are 10 essential KPIs you can display and monitor in your digital workplace : <p> 1 . Cost of Goods Sold ( CoGS ) " This accounts for the cost of inventory production , namely materials and manufacturing . Costs from shipping and employees are excluded . This KPI is calculated by adding the value of your inventory purchased during a time period to the value of the inventory held at the beginning of that period . Subtract the value of the remaining inventory at the end of the time period to obtain the CoGS . This KPI is the starting point for retailers to determine products ' markup over wholesale price , gross margins , and other KPIs . <p> - 2 . Gross Margin " This KPI is the- difference between revenue and cost of goods sold . Investopedia calculates gross margin- as the ratio of profit to revenue . For retailers , gross margin shows profit as a percentage of the sales price . This allows the retailer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if your gross margin is 25% , and you sell $100 , your profit is $25 . <p> - 3 . Sales per Square Foot " Relevant for brick-and-mortar retailers , this KPI measures the average sales generated from each square foot of retail space . Sales per square foot- gives a retailer comparative insight on the performance of the store layout and sales associates ; this KPI can indicate which layout works best for different store branches . <p> - 4 . Inventory Turnover Rate " This KPI indicates the rate at which a type of- inventory is sold in a year ; in order words , how quickly you sell certain products . Retailers can calculate this as either the cost of goods sold or the net sales divided by the average inventory . ( Average inventory can be calculated as the average of the beginning and ending inventory in a period . Using multiple data points can give a clearer picture of inventory turnover . ) <p> 5 . Average Customer Spend " Average customer spend is the total sales revenue in a period divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This KPI is useful for measuring the success of promotions or sales initiatives among associates . <p> 6 . Customer Retention Rate " This is the rate at which customers return for repeat business . This rate is calculated by subtracting the number of new customers in a period ( month , quarter , year ) from the total customers at the end of that period , then dividing by the number of customers at the start . This KPI can inform a retailer to the performance of their customer service , the success of promotions and the effect of customer satisfaction on brand loyalty . <p> - 7 . Customer Satisfaction " Customer satisfaction can be measured through various ways . A fairly straightforward method is to include surveys in-store or online after customers make a purchase . A more technical approach would use social media analytics to gauge people 's impressions through comments , likes , tweets and posts . This data can be visualized and presented in graphs that compare customer satisfaction over a span of time . <p> - 8 . Average Purchase Value " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time period . ( For ecommerce retailers , this KPI is also known as Average Order Value . ) This KPI is determined by dividing the total sale value by the number of transactions . This can inform a retailer to the average first time order of a customer , whether promotions are generating higher or lower values of deals , and how many deals you 'll need to generate to reach other metrics ( such as an increased gross margin ) . <p> - 9 . Conversion Rate " This KPI is relevant for online retail ( ecommerce or online sales ) . The conversion rate is the total number of conversions ( desired actions ) taken divided by the total number of clicks . A retailer can evaluate which online ads or calls-to-action have the highest conversion rates under certain parameters , and optimize their content accordingly . This allows the retailer to put their content in front of the people most likely to click and initiate conversions , leading to greater performance in other KPIs . <p> 10 . Year over Year " This KPI allows retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance for the same period in previous years . Retailers can compare the performances of products , locations , departments or other parameters to chart growth and make forecasts . <p> There 's more to business than tracking KPIs . Yet keeping track of KPIs can give business owners valuable insight into their company 's actual performance . There are few things more valuable than time ; business owners need a comprehensive yet simple platform to view , compare , and rearrange their performance metrics . <p> LiveTiles Design is a UI overlay to the popular Microsoft SharePointapplication platform . SharePoint is highly functional yet suffers from a dense user experience that turns away all but experienced developers . LiveTiles Design empowers even non-technical users to create a customized , functional digital workplace in a fraction of the time it would take a dedicated development team .

This in turn measures the potential of deploying business initiatives . The goal here is not to force your employees to use a new program , but instead to help shed light on the current tasks they are performing and support them in adopting a more effective system . <p> Although end user adoption is a proven method in adapting to new and ever-evolving workplace practices , some companies struggle in properly encouraging user adoption . However , there are several techniques that companies can gage to increase user adoption in their workplace . <p> We figure that you can get very creative and use very out-of-the-box methods as well as some more traditional effective strategies . <p> Here are 5 ways to push end user adoption in your business : <p> 1 . Webinars <p> Businesses can host online webcasts where they can interact with end users and educate them on software best practices . Webinars can also provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of a new software demonstrated on their own screen . Often webinars include a chatting feature where viewers can chime in and ask questions . <p> 2 . In-Person Training Sessions- <p> While they can be more logistically complicated , an in-person training session provides attending users the opportunity to provide immediate feedback and have their questions answered by an expert . It may also be beneficial to provide training on an ongoing basis . Instead of just handing off a solution with one-off training , you can continuously support the end users as they encounter issues . <p> 3 . Incentive Features <p> Some solutions can include miscellaneous features like webcam recordings which drive users back to the platform and obviously persuade them to use the software more . Other features consist of birthday announcements , pop culture references , etc . Also , some firms have created " scavenger hunts " to encourage employees to use the portal by looking for specific clues and if solved would win a free voucher for something . <p> 4 . Gamification <p> Gamification puts forward the idea of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which this is done is by leveraging reward and point systems to employees who are performing to high standards . For example , Arup gamified their project recordkeeping system by awarding points and rankings based on the completeness of project records . This incentivizes employees to fill out more detailed records to gain more points , but also highlighted which project records required more information . <p> 5 . Choose an Ambassador <p> Assign a person to be a positive peer resource on the new systems . Ideally , this is an end user who knows the product inside and out and has enough social influence to inspire his or her coworkers to adopt the new service . Affiliating the new solution with a familiar face can make the new software seem fun and relatable . <p> Displayed below is an infographic that shows similar user adoption principles specifically applied to CRM software . <p> LiveTiles Design is a good example of a tool that can help drive user adoption of SharePoint . How ? LiveTiles Design provides a visually pleasing interface that is also exceptionally user friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools to create an intranet site for their team in minutes , which they can in turn use to increase productivity and collaborate on project materials . <p> More than anything it is crucial that you find a solution that answers the needs of end users . Put simply , users adopt systems they either have to use , or that they want to use . If an end user is forced to use a system that they do not want to use or do not find easy to use , then the business as a whole wont reap the full benefit of what that system is meant to provide . If the solution is carefully designed to be user friendly , solves the issue that the end user is facing , and is accompanied by effective user adoption guidance , then it is bound to be successful .

Educators could soon find themselves at the head of a digital classroom with AI at its heart . What could possibly go wrong ? <h> Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence : - 15 Reasons Why it Works <p> 1 . Personalized Learning : Much attention is usually given to what students learn , with a historical tendency to focus on curriculum . However , how a student learns is just as important . Advances in AI are giving teachers a better understanding of how their students learn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ITS ( Intelligent Tutoring Systems ) : ITS are n't  some far-off vison of the future " they already exist in a practical capacity .

Adaptive Group Formation : By analyzing learner information , AI can generate groups particularly suited to a certain task , or groups that balance one learners weaknesses with another learners strengths . <p> 4 . Facilitation by Example : Models of effective collaboration can be used to support learners and help them identify effective problem solving strategies <p> 5 . Intelligent Moderation : Intelligent Moderation allows human tutors , moderators and teachers to analyze the data produced by large groups with the assistance of AI techniques like machine learning . In turn , educators can be more efficient in the classroom . <p> 6 . Virtual Reality Learning : Taking a page from aviation education , VR-assisted learning allows for educational support in authentic environments and extends the boundaries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a richer understanding of the material . This will also act as a stepping stone to real-world experiences , with fully integrated AIs , humans will employ machines for space and ocean exploration , fraud detection , knowledge management , job training and precision surgeries . <p> 7 . Essay Grading Software : Software that can instantly grade student essays is a significant benefit . Every graded essay adds to a central database to which future essays are compared . <p> 8 . Real-time Problem Solving Assessment : This reduces the load on teachers by providing simultaneous instruction in a classroom setting . <p> 9 . Improving Course Quality : AI can analyze patterns in which a large number of students submit wrong answers to the same questions . By alerting the educator to these patterns , AI can help make teachers more effective . <p> 10 . Dynamic Scheduling and Predictive Analysis By using predictive computing , AI can learn students habits and propose the most efficient study schedule for them . This is a benefit for the customer service agent , medical intern , or anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get bored , tired or need a break and should the machine encounter a problem or question out of its programming a human will be contacted to step in . <p> 11 . Custom Textbooks : Educators will be able to import a syllabus and AI will generate a textbook filled with the core content ( CTI ) . This makes for an incredible amount of customization , not only from class to class or grade to grade , but within the school year itself . <p> 12 . Virtual Humans : While seemingly something out of science fiction , virtual humans are already a reality . Intelligent interfaces like " the twins " at the Boston Museum of Science , for example , provide a much-needed social dynamic to artificial intelligence . Virtual humans like avatars , digital assistants or Chatbots are cost efficient and can work 24 hours , seven days a week in those repetitive and time-consuming tasks no human enjoys doing . <p> 14 . Machine Translation : While todays translation apps are not as accurate as human translation , machine translation can be faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language gap for many second language students . <p> 15 . Empowering the Disabled ( Differently-Abled ) : AI programs that augment the educational experience for the disabled are already in development by companies like Facebook . These advancements can grant learners with special needs a greater sense of autonomy . <p> As groundbreaking as AI in the classroom can be , it is not without a few drawbacks . <h> Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence : 6 Reasons to be Skeptical <p> 1 . Cost : When combining the cost of installation , maintenance and repair , its clear that AI is expensive . Only the most well-funded schools will find themselves in a position to benefit from AI . <p> 2 . Addiction : As we rely on machines to make everyday tasks more efficient , we risk technology addiction . <p> 3 . Lack of Personal Connections : While smart machines improve the education experience , they should not be considered a substitute for personal interaction . Relying too much on these machines to grade or tutor may lead to educational oversights that hurt learners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching more efficient could create less of a demand for educators . With the advent of MOOCs , class size is no longer as much of a determining factor in quality education , and even at the K-12 level , the implementation of AI may mean a decrease in teaching aids and assistants . <p> 5 . Efficient Decision Making : Computers are getting smarter everyday . They are demonstrating not only an ability to learn , but to teach other computers . However , it is debatable whether they can implement intuition-based decision making in new situations , which often arises in the classroom . <p> 6 . Loss of information : When the inevitable occurs and an AI needs repairs , how much information will be lost ? <p> When it comes to the pros and cons of artificial intelligence , there are clearly more benefits . However , in order to fully gain from AI , a balance must be struck between the machines that optimize tasks and the people that use the machines . The aim of artificial intelligence in the classroom should n't be to replace educators . It should make their jobs easier .

For many educators , it teaches students how to think differently . This does n't  just mean thinking creatively , but thinking empathetically and putting oneself in someone elses shoes . Design thinking encourages students to fully realize their ideas . Understand , observe , ideate and define is only the first part of the equation . By assigning projects to students , educators can guide them to complete the prototype and iteration aspects of their ideas . Here are a few starter projects to bring into the classroom . <h> 3 Fun Design Thinking Projects : <p> 1 . Instant Ramen Project : Website- d.school- has more than a few starter projects to help facilitate design thinking in the classroom . However , one of the more interesting ones is the Instant Ramen Project . While instant Ramen might be quick and delicious , it is not exactly the most nutritious food choice . The Instant Ramen Project sets students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this college diet staple . More so , it asks them to take something grounded in a particular culture and redefine it for their target audience . <p> 2 . Classroom Redesign Project : Weve already written about how the architecture of the classroom factors greatly into the productivitythat takes place within it . This project asks students to think critically and creatively about the factors that affect the performance of themselves and their peers . Students can arrange their desks to better facilitate group work and designate spaces for bouts of physical activity . Allowing students to redesign the layout of the classroom can be a fun exercise that pays off down the road in the form of increased student engagement and a more manageable environment for educators . Most significantly , designing their own space with little teacher interference can yield a greater sense of learner autonomy for students . <p> 3 . Persona/Problem Project : This is the project that Simon Tyrell assigned students at the 2nd annual Designathon . Designed to engage empathy , this project largely leaves students to their own devices . The Persona/Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peers . Once theyve created a detailed persona , they need to identify a specific problem faced by that persona . The students draw on their own real life experiences as well as those of their peers in order to identify real issues and assign them to their persona . Then , they are given 15 minutes to brainstorm 50 solutions . There is no limit to how ridiculous the ideas can be because the students will eventually present their most feasible solution to the class . Using feedback from their classmates and the educator , students then set about designing and creating a prototype of the solution . <p> While we support the use of paper and pencil , digital technology can optimize student performance . Design thinking and its subsequent projects put a heavy focus on collaboration , andLiveTiles Mosaic , a free UI design solution for grades K-12 with an Office 365 tenant , enables teachers to create a digital classroom that facilitates collaboration . <p> Mosaic allows for social media integration as well as the sharing of documents through applications like OneDrive , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other about aspects of their products through social media and then share feedback and documents with each other . This enables educators to track student progress and provide immediate feedback on aspects of their projects . <p> This feedback is integral to design thinking , and further transforms the educators from lecturers into guides . It gives learners more control over the learning process and provides the necessary tools of empathy and creativity with which to dissect this process . With a national focus on STEM education right now , it is important that we not lose sight of the creative and emotional aspects of education . With its inherent adaptability , design thinking let 's us do just that , no matter the curriculum . <p> The above project examples are just a few ways to implement design thinking into your classroom . We would love to hear about more ideas , especially from educators who have had success with design thinking projects . 
@@109788709 @5188709/ <h> The IKEA of Intranets <p> by Ameir Abouelela <p> Mar 09 , 2016 <p> Researchers have coined a term " the IKEA effect , " a phrase that originates from the Swedish retailer , and suggests that , when given the proper tools , anyone can create and customize something sufficiently . This theory first was published by Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School , Daniel Mochon of Yale University and Dan Ariely of Duke University in 2011 . Their experiments demonstrate that self-assembly has a measurable impact on the evaluation of a product by its consumers . <p> One could say that this very effect could be applied to the emergence of the digital workplace , no ? Well , let 's look at the facts : The digital workplace model provides fast and easy business solutions for companies " and its spreading across the world like a global wildfire . <p> The digital workplace will continue to grab the attention of businesses worldwide . Why ? First off , it provides anywhere-access , a feature from which business professionals hugely benefit , because it grants them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes or while catching their next flight to meet a partner ! <p> Secondly , the digital workplace provides simplicity by consolidating all necessary company information on one platform which all employees can access . This consolidation breaks down the divides of a hierarchical spectrum , a dissolution that increases both productivity and collaboration . <p> So how is the IKEA effect present in the intranet industry ? Well , far beyond creating simplistic work methods , software solutions have surfaced that now allow users to be more present in the process of building an efficient intranet . No only do these solutions enable intranets to be far more productive , they also let users customize and create intranets according to their own personal style . You can find almost any application program interface ( API ) that your company uses on a regular basis , and incorporate it in your intranet . <p> Such programs can include , but are not limited to , CRMs , social media channels and document management software . Users also can design the intranet to look visually appealing . So , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disposal , businesses are using the digital workplace to customize the perfect platform on which to run their companies effectively .

There are a lot of hoops to jump through and responsibilities to juggle at just one job , but if you are managing multiple sites and only doing it via phone and/or email , the only show you 're going to put on is a clown performance . A lot of people spread over a wide spectrum of disciplines are involved at all levels of the process , so efficient communication , - accessible information , and reliable organization are all integral throughout your operation to make it successful . When the old school method just ca n't keep up anymore , the answer is to turn to the digital and capitalize on construction management software . <p> Construction management software , project management software , and construction project management software are pretty much all the same thing , so throughout this article I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are really getting into semantics , construction managers and project managers can have different roles in the operation despite how often both titles cross over and share responsibilities . In many cases they are just merged into one blanket position . Anyway . Back to the software . Project management software creates a digital workspace for collaboration and accessible information . The data can cover all bases from the general progression of a project to the finer details of the day-to-day that amount to that general progression . The software is designed to operate with the parameters of a specific start and end date in mind , so it may prove to be inappropriate for work that is ongoing . This means that certain duties are visible across the platform so that a team can ensure a deadline is met by efficiently dividing assignments . <p> That 's really the core mechanic of project management software " putting everything out on the table . Milestones , tasks , and subtasks of all involved parties are laid out so that everyone can see them , add corresponding notes/files , discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being able to allocate manpower and supplies efficiently . Apps like Nintex and BuilderTREND are some good examples of software that can be used in construction to allow you to do this . Nintex has a strong drag and drop tool set for workflow automation that can be used for all phases of a building project , from handling leads all the way through to billing . It does an excellent job of managing invoices , tasks , the time involved , and data analytics across the board on a user per month basis so that what you pay can scale to how much work you have coming in . <p> Another solid option to take is BuilderTREND . BuilderTREND is specifically construction management software that is cloud-based and geared toward home building and remodeling . This award-winning project management software has features that include proposal generation , bid management , to-do lists , timesheets , and functions for client organization ( such as changing orders ) among many others . <p> If you want to take things a step further and really wow the masses with your effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also incorporate LiveTiles into your business model . LiveTiles works as a great tool to bridge that construction management software with the rest of your company 's digital workplace because integrating a third party app with the rest of your intranet portals is as simple as pointing and clicking , then dragging and dropping . ( It even already has a tile for Nintex ) . A big feature of LiveTiles is that it has a mobile responsive design to capitalize on optimal usability in a flash so that updates and maintenance can happen in the workplace or on the go without any of the typical hassle . <p> Integrating LiveTiles into your business gives you a truly one-in-all software that draws together each little piece into one grand picture , and that 's empowering . Having that kind of flexibility with all of your apps , portals , and functions enables you to put your office in your pocket and take it with you into the field , spread it across multiple locations , and make changes when needed- in a moments notice . Every update , patch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real time . So whether you just finished tailoring the entire plan of attack to better suit new circumstances , or simply edited a typo ; the second you make a change in your construction management workflow is the second the change actually occurs . That means keeping a team connected , coordinated , and confident in its duties from the get-go all the way through completion is no sweat . <p> Its also a no-brainer . Companies that have embraced this wave of digital transformation have benefited tremendously . Utilizing project management software and platforms that streamline workflows , such as LiveTiles , expedites a number of processes saving a ton of time and money . According to this article : <p> In a global survey of 1,442 senior executives at organisations with more than $250 million of revenue , 56% of UK respondents were found to be executing digital transformation as a coordinated strategic programme . <p> The article goes into the observation that companies that are taking to digital transformation have double the revenue growth than those who are not . That type of growth occurs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would otherwise be allotted into learning new technology/practices and how to maintain them , as well as a number of other financial sand traps that are nicely examined in this white paper on the value of workflow digitization . <p> So whether you want to trim the fat and save a boatload in your business , your project management software , or just your general day-to-day , LiveTiles is there for you . Were pushing the boundaries on any preconceived notions for beautiful organization and efficiency , and it would be great to have you along .

Technology has drastically changed business practices , and has made it more difficult for companies to keep up . One solution , according to Vadim Tabakman of Nintex , is for organizations to take advantage of workflow automation . <p> " The business needs to get a good understanding of the process before automating it . " <p> Workflow automation is software that coordinates the activities of everyone in an organization to ensure that the right people get the right information , at the right time . When considering workflow automation , organizations often wonder if they should start from scratch or work off what 's already in place . Is one approach better than the other ? <p> These are necessary questions to ask , especially as companies often fill the workplace with unnecessary digital clutter . According to Tabakman , an effective approach to workflow automation is for organizations to take advantage of User Defined Actions ( UDAs ) . UDAs allow workflow designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same process more than once . <p> With Nintex Workflow , each department within an organization can build its own UDAs . UDAs that are specific to a particular department do n't  need to be made visible to other departments . Only team members who build the UDAs will be able to view them . <p> " User Defined Actions can be built by anyone who is given permissions to build Nintex Workflows . " <p> Before adopting workflow automation , organizations should plan to see which parts of an organization can be streamlined . In Tabakmans view there are three reasons why organizations should increase workflow efficiency with UDAs once this is accomplished . <p> 3 Benefits of Workflow Automation : <p> 1 . Workflow automation empowers the people . Workflow designers are empowered , especially when they use UDAs . This is important for organizations that want to make their staff feel connected and part of a larger community . <p> 2 . Workflow automation saves time and money . Since UDAs are reusable , organizations can save time , money and significant amounts of energy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success when the workflow is effectively streamlined and made efficient . UDAs increase this productivity so that workers can accomplish more . <p> In order to ensure that workers complete the right tasks in the right order , organizations should take advantage of workflow automation software to increase productivity and make the workplace more efficient . <p> About Vadim Tabakman:Vadim Tabakman is a Nintex Technical Evangelist and Nintex Developer with 20 years of development experience , and over 9 years of experience in SharePoint and Nintex technologies .

It was an enormous milestone for many nations around the world to be able to produce quality goods with the assistance of robotic engineering . It definitely changed the way companies would continue to operate . Much like the beginning of the industrial era , the digital era has placed influence on various industries , especially with regard to enhancing IT infrastructure for a more efficient workflow within companies bringing upon us the age of the digital transformation which put simply is the changing of outdated business solutions to a more digital landscape . For example , the use of cloud technologyto share and collaborate . <p> Many industries have of course jumped on the bandwagon for enhancing IT infrastructure via digital solutions , but what about the industrial workforce ? Have they opted out for traditional methods ? The answer is yes . Many manufacturing companies hesitate to implement digital solutions due to the fact that they do not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it running . Also , a more common fear is security of all company assets " understandable . However with more new and effective enterprise solutions on the rise , and complete with impeccable security protection , the time to digitize is NOW . <p> Two things to consider regarding the digital transformationin the industrial workforce are increased collaboration and better connectivity amongst humans and robots . This leads to further productivity amongst human workers and in turn more work is completed and more revenue is accrued . Microsoft SharePoint is a major trailblazer in these efforts . SharePoint is one of the most widely used enterprise collaborationtools in enterprise deployment . Why ? Because of its ability to store and share documents and simply communicate with other staff members on projects to accurately complete more work at a faster rate . <p> And what makes SharePoint even more effective ? We assert that LiveTiles massively increases efforts to improve workplace initiatives for the industrial workforce . Digital transformation has never been easier for the less tech savvy individuals . <p> With LiveTiles , you can easily create stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share and collaborate with team members , or in this case , machines as well . By providing these services for the employees , they can better control how and when the machines perform by having access to data , scheduling and other necessary forums . What more ? LiveTiles 3rd party API can provide industrial workforces with the IoT to ensure everything can be controlled and monitored in the digital workplace . <p> Industrialization is a huge part of societies worldwide because of the products that need to be manufactured and ultimately used by other industries . The Industrial Revolution marked a huge moment in history because it changed the way we worked forever , allowing the mass production of items once hand made . This is very similar to the digital era . Most companies are now seeing the importance of going digital . The goal here is not to cut out either the human or the machine in the equation but ultimately to enhance the relationship between each of them for a more collaborative and productive workplace experience . <p> One such example of a company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holwick Constructors made a whopping $2 million a year by adopting Office 365 technology . By providing contractors , architects , site managers , and other employees the ability to collaborate in real time without having to be on the corporate network , the streamlining of work efforts was massively simplified . Additionally , the Italian automobile company , Maseratihas sparked an interest in the digital transformation . Maserati uses IT for manufacturing execution systems for production , monitoring and quality control . <p> So as you can see , the vision of a connected industrial workplace is possible with digital transformation " by providing increased connectivity amongst coworkers to ensure machines perform more efficiently . As such , companies can perform at a more rapid pace , complete more work , gain more revenue and attain all of these goals at a relatively inexpensive cost . <p> Have you seen a digital shift in the manufacturing industry ?

Technology in the digital workplace such as cellphones and tablets allow employees to connect with each other not just from inside the office but from anywhere they travel to . According to the 2016 Digital Workplace Communications survey which polled 250 communications professionals , 48 percent said their companies need to rethink digital workplace communication . The most frequently used communication tool used by respondents studied in the survey was Email at 97 percent . With lackluster communication becoming a problem for many businesses , here are four internal communication tools that employees should take advantage of to instantly collaborate with each other . <p> 1 . Yammer <p> Yammer is a private social network powered by Microsoft that allows employees to stay digitally connected anywhere at any time . Yammer is accessible through every Office 365 subscription and is a great tool to provide an engaging community for employees . LiveTiles includes a feature that turns Yammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Integrating Yammer into your company 's ' intranet using LiveTiles drag and drop tool is an easy way to create the opportunity for innovative collaboration between employees . <p> 2 . Skype For Business <p> Skype for Business is part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products . With Skype for Business , employees can quickly connect with each other from all around the world through video chat , instant messaging , call , and have the ability to schedule future meetings . Meetings allow you to connect with up to 250 people " even if they 're not on Skype for Business . All they need is a phone or internet connection . Skypes video chat service separates itself from other apps on this list , so for companies that value video chatting style of communication Skype for Business makes a lot of sense . <p> 3 . Facebook at Work <p> Facebook at Work has been used in beta testing since last January and now has over 450 companies trying it out . At Work is still not available to the public , but leading Facebook at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch date is " very close . " The business version of Facebook will look a lot like regular Facebook except there will be no advertisements and no connection to personal accounts " everything revolves around communication via groups . Companies can make separate Groups for different projects , teams , announcements , and social topics . <p> 4 . Slack <p> Slack has become one of the fastest growing business apps of all time , as the startup company is now valued at $2.8 Billion . Features offered by Slack include organized chat rooms ( channels ) by topic , private groups , and direct messaging. - All content inside Slack is searchable , including files , conversations , and users . Slack is integrated with third-party services such as Google Drive and Dropbox that make it easy to share and save files . <p> Without free-flowing communication , innovation in the digital workplace will stumble .

There are quite a few major new features , including the much-requested ability to make LiveTiles page content searchable . So without further ado , we present to you the below new features , improvements and bug fixes . <p> Previously , on LiveTiles Design pages , content was unable to be indexed and would not show up in the SharePoint search . With this release , we are adding in indexing onto all of our pages for the image , content and text tiles . <p> LiveTiles Pages being found via SharePoint Search <p> There are two scenarios whereby Text tile 's content ( using both the current Text tile as well as the new Content tile ) will be captured for indexing by a SharePoint search : <p> SharePoint Publishing Feature is turned on in the site collection <p> In this scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content type . <p> The content contained with all Text tiles on the page is written to- Page Content column- which is a Publishing HTML field type and as such is indexed natively by SharePoint . <p> ( Worth noting that this is the same behavior on how the classic SharePoint publishing pages work ) . <p> The first 200 characters of the text content is added to the- Byline column . This is used by the News List tile when it is configured to use pages as its source of items . We also capture the first image into the picture column for the same reason . <p> Note : if you save the page to Site Pages library rather than Pages the Article content type will be associated into the library . <p> SharePoint Publishing Feature is not turned on in the site collection <p> In this scenario , the Article Page content type is not available. - Instead , the page will use the default Wiki page content type in Site Pages as it currently does . However , the update will add the text content from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indexed . <p> Note : In this scenario , the content type does not have Byline or Picture columns so the integration to the News List tile will not be as seamless . However , you can make this available by extending the Wiki Page content type with two custom columns : - LTArticleByline ( of type Single Line of Text ) and- LTPublishingPageImage- ( of type Image with Publishing ) . If they are found to exist , the page save will use them . Please refer to this KB article for more details . <p> IMPORTANT NOTE : - Getting the changes will require page re-saves , as it is the save action that will trigger the content type and columns to be used . <p> As this uses SharePoint standard indexing and search , content on the pages will not be instantly searchable from your pages on save . This is due to the search updating periodically and may take up to 20 minutes ( subject to your search indexing configuration ) . <p> For more information on this feature please visit the Knowledge Base- here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing the Rich Content tile .

@@109788728 @5188728/ <h> Improving student engagement <p> Too many teachers are frustrated that their students are more interested in their smart phones than the subject matter being covered in class . When a student checks his phone , the typical response by the teacher is to take the phone away and punish the student for being distracted and disrespectful . The student will get angry and leave the classroom in a rage . <p> This anecdote is all too common . Some of todays students care more about their social media and mobile devices than the classroom . They 're not interested in the course content , have no inclination to study and could care less about the latest exam . Rather than lament this , teachers should learn from it . Student engagement is difficult to achieve , and teachers have to work for it . <h> Why Are Your Students Bored ? <p> There 's nothing more frustrating than a sea of bored , disinterested students . One student may fall asleep during an important lecture , and another may check his cell phone . While disheartening , these student engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account . <p> Rather than punish the students for not paying attention , teachers should think about why they are n't  paying attention in the first place . Education experts Richard Strong , Harvey F. Silver and Amy Robinson interviewed a number of teachers and students to explain the secret to successful student engagement . " Engaging work , " they wrote , " was work that stimulated students curiosity , permitted them to express their creativity , and fostered positive relationships with others . " <p> Easier said than done , perhaps , but according to Strong , Silver and Robinson , students were also very specific about what they did n't  like in the classroom : " Work that was repetitive , that required little or no thought , and that was forced on them by others . " <p> So what , exactly , are teachers doing that deters student engagement ? Much of the problem is the traditional education model and many of the failed teaching techniques that are still incorporated into the classroom . <p> Many teachers , for example , still believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . It shouldnt surprise teachers to see their students doze off when they stand in front of them all class period and deliver the same dry , stale talking points . Lectures stymie the student engagement process . <p> In addition , teachers are still clinging to old-fashioned textbooks " those thick ones that have many editions and cost over $100.00 . These textbooks once had a place in the classroom , but as consumption habits have shifted over time and students are getting most of their information from the Internet , it seems counterproductive to have them carry these clunky textbooks that havent been updated since the 1990s . <p> Perhaps most importantly , students are annoyed that they have to complete the same types of projects for different classes . Whether its literature or social studies , students are forced to study for mundane standardized tests and write similar research papers . Of course , students should learn to develop these skills , but if this is all they 're doing , student engagement will not come into fruition . <h> Make Students Curious Again <p> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  make as much of an effort to update the classroom for the 21st century . Teachers can use LiveTiles Mosaic to design a digital classroom that makes their students curious again . <p> Rather than assign a boring textbook reading , for example , teachers can add Ted Talks videos into the digital classroom . These are short 20 minute videos that are meant to stimulate discussion , and they are categorized by subject so that teachers do n't  have to waste too much time searching for the right ones . <p> Teachers can use Ted Talks videos to expand their students learning horizons . According to education expert Maryellen Weimer , teachers should " create educational experiences for students that are challenging and enriching and extend their academic abilities . " That is , students want teachers to push them , and the more they have to use critical thinking skills to reflect , question , conjecture , evaluate and make connections , the more engaged they will be . Ask students to write about a provocative Ted Talk , and student engagement will dramatically improve . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not at all . In fact , teachers can use tools like OneNote to upload more contemporary readings , or link to a relevant article that they found online . The point is that an Office 365 education goes beyond the textbook to offer students a diverse array of digital content . By assigning readings and videos that are contemporary and relevant , student engagement will improve because students will feel as if what they 're learning matters to their lives and the contemporary world . <h> Encourage Creativity in the Classroom <p> Students spend a lot of time developing their test-taking and writing skills , but rarely get the chance to express their creativity . When their creativity is stifled , they lose interest in the class and begin to tune out . <p> One way to solve this is to integrate presentation software like Sway into the classroom . Sway allows users to combine text and media to create a presentation . The presentation tool is stored on Microsofts servers and can be viewed and edited anytime . Sway is a fun way to enhance student engagement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another digital tool that allows students to express their creativity . Teachers can assign group projects and require students to present their PowerPoint to the entire class . Creative assignments like these make students feel more invested in their work and are bound to boost student engagement . <p> To further benefit student engagement , teachers can use Mosaic to add Spotify to the digital classroom . Many students today use Spotify to play their music , and this is bound to capture their attention . <p> In replace of a reading one day , for example , teachers can ask students to pick a song and write a fictional short story about it , or an interpretation of the songs major themes . As teacher Laura Treble explains , creative touches like these " contributes to what should be our ultimate goal as educators : inspiring students to become curious , engaged , and interested in the world around them and within them . " <h> Develop Classroom Community <p> The classroom is more than just a place to learn . Its also a social space . Students spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for them to stay engaged , they must feel like they belong to a community . Strong relationships in the classroom strengthen student engagement and lead to more successful students . <p> Many teachers try to create a sense of community , but struggle to connect in overcrowded classes . At the same time , there are the inevitable shy students who are incredibly intelligent but too timid to participate in person . <p> Every student counts , and every relationship in the classroom contributes something positive or negative to the overall environment . Since most young people today are connected on social media , teachers , as well , would be wise to establish a social network for the classroom to enhance student engagement . <p> Yammer , for example , is an online space in which teachers and students can share important information and insights . Students can post an interesting article they read , or a cool video . Teachers can congratulate their students on a particularly engaging discussion . Whatever the post may be , Yammer is a online space that reminds teachers and student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space " its a community where student engagement matters . <p> However , some teachers worry that a social network for the class will only expose vulnerable students to cyber-bullying and further traumatize them . They fear that their goals of cultivating student engagement and establishing a healthy online community will only backfire . These are understandable concerns , but as youth researchers danah boyd and Alice Marwick explain , there is a significant disconnect between what teachers and other authority figures consider bullying and what students consider to be the insignificant drama of daily life . <p> Boyd and Marwick write , " Teenagers say drama when they want to diminish the importance of something . Repeatedly , teenagers would refer to something as just stupid drama , something girls do , or so high school. We learned that drama can be fun and entertaining ; it can be serious or totally ridiculous ; it can be a way to get attention or feel validated . But mostly we learned that young people use the term drama because it is empowering . " <p> This does n't  mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way . In fact , it should comfort teachers to know that Yammer can be moderated in case cyber-bullying does take place in the digital classroom . An active moderator should encourage cyber-bullies to think twice about posting anything nasty in the digital classroom , and it will give the bullied assurance that this particular digital environment is a safe space . <p> When teachers add Yammer to the digital classroom , they indirectly let students know that they understand youth culture . Yammer will empower students and make them feel that their teachers trust them and their communication habitsthat teachers can distinguish between legitimate cyber-bullying and superfluous drama . This interactive digital environment will improve student engagement as it creates a healthy , transparent relationship between teachers and students . <p> With so many apps , devices and screens , its almost impossible to capture and hold a young persons attention . However , this is the job of the teacher if she wants to be successful . There will inevitably be those days when students are tired and unable to concentrate , but overall , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for teachers to improve student engagement is to embrace technology and join the digital classroom .

That 's what SharePoint expert Mark Kruger believes . As a KM guru , he shares his perceptive thoughts about the role of KM in todays professional world . <p> " Speaking from my own experience , a successful digital workforce needs Knowledge Management and more connections to people within their own company . " <p> So what is KM , exactly ? There are different definitions depending on whom you ask , but to put it simply , KM is managing the knowledge of organizations so that it can be shared . An example that Kruger provides is an exit interview , during which senior members of a company dispense all their knowledge for future executives to use . <p> However , as businesses become more tech savvy , Kruger believes that KM must be updated to match the technology of today 's digital era . That is , all of the important information can not simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced ways to gather and share knowledge . <p> " Whether it is large enterprises or small businesses , employees tend to get siloed , missing out on valuable knowledge due to lack of organization and/or retention . " <p> As companies adopt more advanced technologies , KM can become more sophisticated . Programs such as SharePointcan facilitate KM , which gives digital workers the opportunity to communicate and collaborate on a regular basis . Kruger believes that the essence of SharePoint 's purpose is for users to help one another answer questions to develop a community of shared knowledge . These social intranetscan effectively provide more information than exit interviews combined . <p> In addition , the proliferation of mobile devices and social media allows content to be rapidly shared . As Kruger explains , Facebook , YouTube , Twitter , OneDrive , Google Drive and other external applications provide digital workers with platforms to connect , which can only improve an organizations KM .

KM is a necessary process that creates a massive knowledge database for every employee to utilize . Without it , organizations would not be as successful or productive . As digital technology allows workers to communicate 24/7 , businesses should rethink KM approaches to generate a community of shared , useful knowledge .

It 's what stays with users long after they 've finished working , and it can drive user adoption . For these reasons , the field of user experience designhas shown rapid growth over the couple of years . However , finding the balance between functionality and user engagement can be a tricky compromise for any UX designer . <p> For many companies , Microsoft SharePoint is the go-to when it comes to intranet solutions . In fact , in 2012 SharePointpassed 2 billion dollars in earned revenue and has steadily grown since then .

Most of their industry specific SharePoint packages offer some iteration of a document management solution. - In the broadest sense , these allow for documents to be accessed and shared by different users quickly and easily from within the SharePoint infrastructure . However , at the industry specific level , two document management solutions will have completely different sets of functionality , each tailored to optimize user experience in that specific industry or role . <p> For example , when it comes to user experience design , solutions that cater to the legal profession , The ProjectReady Matter Management Engine from Gig Werks allows for the fully scalable and easy management of all Matter related information and data including the creation of Matter sites , secure external collaboration and task management that is easy to use . On the AEC ( architecture , engineering and construction ) front , there is the ProjectReady document control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage project and program life cycles , maintain control of documents and drive global enterprise collaboration from an easy to use interface . <p> This variety of SharePoint solutions makes Gig Werks a logical choice for parent companies who may have subsidiaries in different industries , but want a UX that facilitates cohesion and agility company wide . It also helps keep documents that need to be accessed by both parent and subsidiary companies secure , as well as accessible to those who need them . <p> By partnering with LiveTiles , Gig Werks is able to bring the user experience design functionality to SharePoint , too , only now they use the LiveTiles platform to create a vibrant and intuitive ecosystem for their solutions to live in . With its responsive design , the LiveTiles platform comes optimized for mobile devices , allowing for Gig Werks solutions to be viewed quickly and easily , as the scenario of employees working remotely have risen in the last few of years .

And while surveys show that social media is in part to blame for the epidemic of wasted workdays , integrating social media into theworkplace has proved to have positive effects . None more important than facilitating a culture of workplace collaboration and optimizing the user experience for all employees . <p> Pulling all these individual solutions together into one coherent ecosystem can have a positive impact on productivity .

For businesses that deal directly with customers , a Google survey has shown that having a mobile-friendly site shows a company cares about the business of users their site on mobile devices . Even for B2B businesses , the development of the mobile digital workplace as a way to connect and collaborate with colleagues from a variety of devices and locations requires that digital workplace tools and intranet pages incorporate elements of mobile responsive design . <p> You most likely know at this point what a mobile responsive design site or page is , and what it can do . So when you 're starting to wireframe your ownmobile page , what elements should you include ? In technical terms , this can get pretty particular . However , one main factor that you should keep in mind when drawing up your idea for a site with mobile responsive design is loading time . Though impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many elements ( and certain types of media ) into a mobile site can slow down the page . For a user on a mobile device , possibly needing to look at something in a hurry , a slow load times is extremely detrimental . Atest conducted on the website of The Telegraph newspaper by Easter IslandHeads andOptimizely has demonstrated that users will return to a slow-loading site less frequently and spend less time there . Therefore , slow loading times or delays can greatly undercut user engagement with your mobile site . <p> Mobile Responsive page with features that may delay loading ( photo gallery , GIPHY , unnecessary image ) , built using LiveTiles Design. - Mobile site optimized for a- faster load time , including team-specific elements more appropriate for mobile use . <p> So what steps can you take at the planning level to aim for a faster load time ? A simple measure , according to a multitude of sources , is to steer clear of sizeable files like images or GIFs ( or make the imagesadaptive ) . These tend to take longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle a page with a great deal oftext , the automatic wrapping it does to fit your screen can slow loading as well ) . Some platforms , including LiveTiles Design , offer conditional loading " meaning you can designate which elements load on particular sized screens . For mobile devices , this means that users on small screens wo n't see some elements that may not be relevant to them on that device ( for example , large images , calendars , whatever you choose ) . <p> Something to keep in mind here is that ( at least on the LiveTiles Design platform ) conditional loading is almost entirely visual . Those elements that only load under specific conditions still exist on that page , and even in small-screen mobile versions can slow down a page 's loading time " regardless of whether or not they 're visible . Ideally then , you would want to design your small-screen friendly page to not include these elements at all . If what you 're after is a responsive page that can work on multiple screen types , how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load quickly on all those devices ? <p> Here 's where another tactic , simple but slightly less straightforward , is important . When you 're planning what features or tools you want to include in your responsive or mobile site , you should take a close look at the page 's intended user base , and include only what elements that demographic are likely to use on mobile devices . If the page is for a marketing team , will they need to reference a marketing calendar on the go ? If it 's for a sales team , would they prefer a link to their tracksheet of potential leads ? Does your IT need a mobile version of their helpdesk or ticketing system ? If you get to know what users you want to actively consume the site , then you can get a better idea of what needs to be on that page and what does n't . Including only what isnecessary and what will be used frequently allows you to not overburden your mobile responsive designed page with features that are n't needed and will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads us back again to how you need to make compromises on content when catering to multiple platforms . The idea of an all-in-one responsive page ( that can work efficiently on small- and wide-screen devices ) seems unattainable given the need to prioritize loading times . Usually , businesses work around this issue and prioritize load time by creating a site with two entry points " a mobile-dedicated version and a desktop version . UsingLiveTiles Design , however , you can have the best of both worlds , and save valuable development time while doing it . Within LiveTiles Design , you can create a SharePoint page using mobile responsive design elements in just a few minutes that can adapt to a variety of screen sizes , and which is entirely customized to your team 's or company 's mobile needs . In this way , you could very quickly build separate pages optimized to smaller and larger mobile devices , which allows you to quicken loading times for smaller devices while retaining all the functions your team needs on the go .

However , advancements in technology are enabling us to challenge this teacher-centered approach to education and put more of an emphasis on the students . These advancements not only permit us to educate more effectively , but to disrupt the paradigms of old pedagogy with digital technology . They allow us to think outside of the box and institute new teaching methods into the classroom . One such method that is gaining in popularity is the flipped classroom . <p> In its most basic form , the flipped classroom is simply the inversion of the learning process . Staples of education that once took place within the classroom are moved online and class time is used for discussion and in-class exercises . And while there is no single model for the flipped classroom , there is one that has come to define what people think of when they think of the flipped classroom . <h> The Nuts and Bolts of the Flipped Classroom <p> Video lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach calls for educators to either record their own video lectures or to draw from a plethora of lectures available on the internet . To some , this approach may seem to be merely the digital version of required reading , but studies have shown that students provided with video lectures are more likely to watch them , as opposed to required reading which they often skip . <p> More so , with increasing functionality of mobile devices , students have more convenient ways to access these lectures . The days of having to lug a textbook on a crowded train are over ! Thanks to digital technology , students can simply whip out their smartphones , start watching classroom lectures , pause when necessary and finishing whenever they have free time . <p> However , the flipped classroom is not limited to video lectures . Podcasts , for example , can be used to replace textbooks or compensate for their shortcomings . Students can also create podcasts of their own to assist in peer-to-peer learning . <p> The flipped classroom represents an inversion of the pedagogical model , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> A Student-Centered Approach to Learning <p> By creating or instituting digital lectures which students can watch on their own time , educators are able to free up class time for more constructive work . The flipped classroom model encourages classroom collaboration and more group work and discussions , which enhances the classroom experience for teachers and students . In the traditional classroom , students are forced to take notes while the teacher dictates . This can be counter-productive and lead to problems with retention and an understanding of the class key concepts . <p> In the flipped classroom , students can pause video lectures if they need a break or rewind if they miss something . This approach gives them more control over how the information is digested . This matters , because during the next day of class , the focus has shifted from what the teacher has to say in a lecture to what the students have to say in a discussion . A student-centered approach to learning is one of the pillars of the flipped classroom . <h> Active Learning <p> The term active learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are participants in the learning process . The flipped classroom , with its emphasis on group discussions and in-class activities , encourages active learning . Educators can institute techniques such as discussion-based activities and team-based learning . Quizzes can be accessed online and reviewed by educators before class in order to gauge student understanding . Class time can be used to institute more personalized learning strategies . The flipped classroom approach moves away from the authoritarian dichotomy between teacher and student , allowing for a more formative assessment of student understanding . <p> While the benefits of formative assessment have been explored in various academic studies , one of the biggest barriers to its implementation has been the time-consuming nature of the technique . With lectures left for students to watch on their own time in the flipped classroom , educators can use more class time to focus on the individual needs of students . <h> Changing Your Classroom , Changing Your Role <p> In the flipped classroom , teachers are no longer the main focus . But rather than make teachers obsolete , the flipped classroom enables them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comes a new set of demands .

They must integrate the in-class elements of the flip intuitively with the out-of-class elements and take time to either carefully select or create video lectures . <h> A Growing Trend : Is the Flipped Classroom For You ? <p> As the infographic above demonstrates , from 2012 to 2014 , the percentage of educators flipping at least one lesson went from 48% to 78% , with 96% of educators saying they would recommend the flipped classroom model . However , while the growing adoption seems to indicate that educators benefit from the flipped classroom , more in-depth research on the flipped classroom should be done . <p> This does n't  mean that educators should back away from the flipped classroom . After all , educators are individuals , too . No two teachers are the same , so why should their approaches to teaching be so similar ? The flipped classroom , with its many different variations , allows teachers to create a classroom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some teachers choose to flip entire courses , and others just a lesson or two . The flipped classroom model offers flexibility for teachers , and gives students more control over the learning process . Even if teachers do n't  embrace every aspect of the flipped classroom , theyll find something that is useful to them . Ultimately , when class time frees up , teachers have more room to be creative . <p> Since schools are moving away from an emphasis on the common core , educators can use the flipped classroom model to engage students with the latest technology in more creative ways . This is what the flipped classroom is all about " to use technology to break from tradition and provide personalized learning experiences for students . <p> For example , before the flipped classroom , teachers would lecture about an important topic , let 's say The Great Depression , and ask students to respond to the lecture in a homework assignment . The flipped classroom reverses this , so that teachers can assign The Great Depression lecture for homework and then have students respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " improves student engagement and makes the classroom a more collaborative environment . <h> Designing the Flipped Classroom <p> So now that teachers understand what a flipped classroom is and some of its benefits , how can they go about designing one ? Let 's start with video lectures . <p> Ordinarily , teachers would post video lectures to sites like Vimeo and YouTube . To make this happen , teachers would have to create an account and then have their students subscribe to that account . From there , they would either upload their own video lectures to their channel , or they can upload curated content from the Internet . This is one approach , but its an incredibly complicated process . Not only would this slow teachers down , students would most likely be confused . <p> Instead , teachers can use LiveTiles Mosaic to take technology integration a step further . Mosaic is a no-code UI design solution that can be used to create intuitive digital classrooms . Offered free to any K-12 class with an Office 365 education tenant , Mosaic significantly improves the learning process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop function to embed video lectures into the digital classroom , which students can access at anytime from their mobile devices . <p> Video lectures are beneficial , but Mosaic is capable of so much more . Within minutes , teachers can use it to design a flipped classroom that is specific to their students needs . As the screen shot below illustrates , Mosaic provides a customizable space where educators are able to integrate the functionality of Office 365 apps like Word , OneNote and Sway , as well as cloud-based services like OneDrive , Yammer and SharePoint . Using Mosaic , teachers can post assignments and grades and embed video lectures and social media services . This online integration further extends the boundaries of the flipped classroom by allowing discourse to flow outside of the classroom as well as within it . <p> Because Mosaic must be linked to an Office 365 account , only those with associated emails can access it . Providing students with their own email addresses solely for educational purposes gives them an increased sense of autonomy , ensures that digital classrooms stay secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . <h> Balance and Synergy <p> Technology is slowly but surely infiltrating the field of education . However , the flipped classroom is still no substitute for what teachers can do . Teachers are essential , and without their hard work and dedication , we would n't have an educated society . <p> In many ways , the flipped classroom honors teachers in ways that the traditional classroom never could . Thanks to the flipped classroom , teachers are more successful as they guide their students to use digital solutions in efficient , meaningful and creative ways . <p> Ultimately , the end goal of the flipped classroom is to achieve balance and synergy in the classroom . In this regard , the digital classroom does n't  replace the human element of the learning process , it reinforces it .

An important way for business to measure the financial benefits from an investment in a solution is to calculate its Return on Investment ( ROI ) . While it may seem straightforward , there are a number of factors that can affect SharePoint ROI measurement and ensure sustainable profit in the short and long term for businesses . <p> Three of the most important factors that may affect your SharePoint ROI calculations are n't factors that will show up in a quarter financial report . They are building customer lifetime value , building a SharePoint team , and sheer amount and utility SharePoint features ( some of which you can see in the image below ) . <p> Most businesses strive to achieve and maintain optimal customer lifetime value so that they not only make a sale , but also so they maintain that relationship for continued and high-value revenue . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can present a great benefit for a systems integrator , or a Microsoft partner that specializes in SharePoint deployment . <p> The time and cost that a partner puts into a project for a customer can add up to a huge one-off investment . By building customer lifetime value in the solutions you provide to your customers , the potential for higher-value and larger projects with the same customers in the future can make the scale of the initial investment less off-putting . Over time , it may increase the ROI on your investment in a SharePoint Practice . <p> Internal Assets <p> Another factor that can affect ROI on your SharePoint Practice is the ability of your internal assets , i.e. a SharePoint team , to develop more skills . A team will typically include a sales person , a SharePoint consultant , a project coordinator and ideally one technical SharePoint professional . All of these individuals work together in order to assess a customer 's business needs and meet them with a solid SharePoint solution . <p> So what does this have to do with calculating ROI on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to invest a higher level of resources into finding the right people to form an effective SharePoint team and build a strong practice . While this initial cost may lessen the SharePoint practice ROI at the outset , as your team works together on multiple projects and grow to understand better how to work together and with customers , they can do more and more high-value work that will increase your ROI over the long term . <p> Utilizing SharePoint Features <p> SharePoint features themselves are a cohort of tools that can affect your ROI over the long haul if used correctly . Over time , SharePoint has consistently both developed new iterations of the platform ( the most recent being the much-anticipated SharePoint 2016 ) that have rolled out brand new features and enhanced existing functions to enhance the digital workplace experience . <p> Easily sifting through content and streamlining workplace initiatives might be more of a priority . Rightfully so , these are the areas partners should focus on when consulting their customers " recognizing the right SharePoint features to meet a customer 's needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool set , SharePoint 's features are in themselves a changing factor that can positively affect your ROI and the satisfaction of your customers the longer you have a SharePoint practice . <p> Products like those offered by LiveTiles present the opportunity to further lessen the investment needed in a SharePoint practice . LiveTiles Build and Blueprint allow a user to cut down on the development and creation process for a SharePoint solution , and thereby reduce the cost of investment . Using LiveTiles Design , you can also include multiple SharePoint features are presented in one streamlined and- beautiful intranet . As a partner , you can potentially also use LiveTiles internally to create pages where you can easily access relevant metrics and ROI information related to your SharePoint practice . <p> In short , there are several long-term factors that you should keep in mind when calculating your SharePoint ROI . Their effects may not be seen or felt in short financial periods , but when you take care in creating a SharePoint team , maximizing the potential of SharePoint features , and building customer lifetime value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthier than it would otherwise appear .

Despite hesitation over the security of cloud-based services , cloud technology is being adopted in force by enterprises of all sizes . According to a Gartner study , despite the fact that only 38% of businesses use the cloud currently , 80% of responding businesses stated they would incorporate cloud services into their practice in the next 12 months . <p> Where traditionally software would be run on local servers housed in data centers maintained by a single company , the cloud offers the opportunity to unleash your work from its physical data center infrastructure .

For customers who do not want to add data center maintenance concerns to their already long list of tasks , SharePoint Online offers a platform for the expected SharePoint collaborative tools , but hosted on Microsoft servers that the customers can alter to suit the compliance requirements of their business . <p> Given the recent announcement of the SharePoint mobile app , SharePoint Onlines promise of being able to work from anywhere , on any device sounds like a strong selling point for the platform . <p> However , for those who are wary of completely abandoning their existing data centers , whether over concerns of security , compliance , or other factors , Microsoft also offers SharePoint Server .

This is only for the minimum recommended services " should the customer wish to scale up the hardware requirements would be higher . <p> In short , though as cloud services continue to expand in the business realm , its natural for old hardware to gradually become obsolete .

Its not good enough to bombard people with email blasts or plaster ads all over a webpage . Instead , companies need to establish a brand that is not only instantly recognizable , but also one with which consumers would be comfortable associating . One way to do this is to engage in corporate citizenship . <p> Corporate citizenship , or corporate social responsibility , is not that complicated of a concept . It refers to companies that attempt to act in an ethical manner . Most businesses practice corporate citizenship by giving back to the community in some form .

We all know about its co-founder Bill Gates philanthropy , but what about Microsoft products themselves ? Office 365 Education is offered free to schools that desire to integrate digital technology into the classroom . Why does Microsoft do this ? Because it can bring digital education to students in a cost-effective way , while at the same time , build a positive brand that promotes social justice and inclusiveness . <p> LiveTiles similarly believes in corporate citizenship which is why we also try to make a difference in education .

In the digital workplace , communication is frequent whether through email , intranet , or social media applications . While this constant chatter stimulates employee collaboration , communicating through so many different avenues can often lead to important files getting lost in transition and digital clutter starts to pileup to make finding specific messages a daunting task . <p> Office Delve , a program available within Microsoft Office 365 , is a product that will make it much easier for employees to find documents instead of searching through their overloaded inbox of emails . Delve shows you documents no matter where they 're stored in OneDrive for Business or SharePoint in Office 365 providing one convenient location to view all documents employees are working on across your company . Delve can store a number of different content through OneDrive or SharePoint such as Office Document ( Word , PowerPoint , Excel ) , PDFs , OneNote sections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , images ( for example jpg and png files ) , videos , Email attachments , and links to Yammer webpages . <p> Delve users have their own profile page , making it easier for employees to connect with each other .

The general sentiment is that pumping fresh blood into these fields will lead to innovation that can bolster a sagging educational system and a national infrastructure . However , a concentrated push for a STEM education is lacking a crucial component : the arts . <p> In his TED Talk , Sir Ken Robinson speaks about how the creation of an educational hierarchy , with the sciences at the top and the arts at the bottom , has served to educate children out of creativity . Giving students an outlet to express their creativity is essential to producing innovative thinkers , and creativity is inherent in art . Not only do the arts allow students to express their creativity , they also benefit them in other academic endeavors . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are giving students an education that is relevant to future industries . <p> As more schools around the country begin to focus on STEM centered learning , the groundwork has already been laid for a STEAM powered education . Now , it is on educators to implement the- arts into the- classroom , and they can do this in a variety of ways . <p> For example , elementary school teacher Shareese Halley Casperz uses dance to explore mathematical concepts . This may sound a bit ludicrous , but given the fact that learner engagement allows for a deeper understanding of core concepts , it is easy to see how an actively engaged learner makes for a better learner . <p> The arts do n't  just let students cultivate their creativity , they also provide them with a different way of visualizing fundamental concepts across a broad range of subjects . The integration of the arts into the STEM curriculum offers a new medium through which students can express their creativity : technology . <p> Along with freehand sketching , engineering students have access to a plethora of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to create a variety of objects using basic shapes . Tinkercad is designed to work with 3D printers so that students who have access to this technology can physically interact with their work . <p> Social media is another medium through which art can be digitized . Apps like Instagram , Twitter and Periscope can be used to create educational artistic projects that can be instantly shared with peers . <p> Furthermore , intuitive UI design solutions likeLiveTiles Mosaic enable educators to unify disparate elements of the digital education into an engaging digital classroom . In this cloud-based digital classroom , all educators across the STEM curriculum can share assignments , resources and feedback . The screen shot below provides an example of this engaging learning experience . <p> Much like Mosaic , an education in the arts can serve as the connective tissue which brings together the disparate elements of the STEM curriculum . Students can visualize their environment and how they can impact it . An arts education grants the perspective necessary for the innovative implementation of the knowledge that students have constructed in their STEM classes .

These models are the face of modern-day educationreform . They are connected to the idea that technology , with its transformative capabilities , can optimize education . Andit can , in many great and interesting ways . Education Technology is changing the way students learn , it is leveling the playing field for children with disabilities and it is challenging conceptions of what can be considered a classroom . With all this , you can see why the folks at Silicon Valley really believe in the advent of a techno-utopia . Still , we can not overlook a simple yet inconvenient truth : Technology is a resource that is not distributed equally. - - <h> The Digital Divide <p> Weve spoken about the digital divide between whites and minorities , and how important it can be to get children from minority families digitally involved . But we can also extend the digital divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to tutors , trips and tech in their personal lives , the pressure falls on their schools to meet these needs . Unfortunately , not all schools have the resources to provide the latest education- technology . And even if they do , they might not be able to allocate additional resources to train educators on how to use it . <p> Herein lies the crux : Its not so much about the education- technology that is being used , but about how it is being used . Most of the nations students have access to computers , which means that they have access to the internet . They have access to whiteboards and projectors and even digital cameras . But if these resources are still being used to reinforce traditional pedagogy , then these students are not seeing the benefits of education reform bolstered by technology . <p> A reformed digital pedagogy puts the focus on the students and allows the educators to play more of a guiding role . This is where the educational benefits come in . There is a lot to gain by allowing students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can construct their own knowledge . <p> Technology optimizes this reformed pedagogy , but it does n't  create it . It is still entirely dependent on the human component . Throwing all kinds of tech at students without taking into account their individual circumstances , or the circumstances of the learning institutions , is very much the one size fits all attitude that has failed us for years . It is the same mode of thinking that has given us the legacy of No Child Left Behind and standardized testing . <h> Access and Adaptability with Mosaic <p> So how does LiveTiles address this ? For a start , our education software LiveTiles Mosaic is free for any K-12 classroom with an Office 365 tenant . It does n't  matter what kind of school teachers work in , theyve got access . <p> However , access is only half the battle . Mosaic is also incredibly intuitive and user-friendly . As the screen shot below illustrates , users can create an engaging digital classroom within a matter of minutes . There is no need to know how to code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook and OneNote onto the same page , and alter the sizes and color of these tiles as they wish . The best part : Teachers can personalize the classroom to suit their students specific needs . <p> Social media , video lectures and online assignments , standard components of the digital classroom , are useless if students cant access them . There is hope with Mosaic . The digital classroom can be accessed across different mobile devices , which means that students who do not have computers can log in with their smart phones , and vice versa . With 77% of low-income Americans between the ages 18 and 29owning smartphones , its easy to see how Mosaics mobile-friendly digital classroom becomes a major factor in closing the education technology gap and fighting inequality . <p> The way we integrate digital solutions is just as important as the solutions we integrate . However , while making our lives more convenient and allowing us to address certain issues and demographics in new ways , these solutions are not a cure all . Inequality is present in all facets of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors . Stamping it out requires more than just education technology solutions .

With education experts from all over the world gathered at the Denver Convention Center , there were countless discussions of the latest trends in education technology . One of the most hotly debated topics was the digital divide between urban and rural communities in the United States . Education reform is very much needed in America , but it is also needed in many other less-developed countries . Yes , interactive learning and theflipped classroom are great forms of digital pedagogy , but they can not realistically be implemented in places where internet access is limited or non-existent . In order to address the issues that plague developing nations , we must first address the digital divide by implementing impactful but feasible digital solutions to improve global education . <h> 3 Solutions for Global Education : <p> - 1 . E-Readers and E-books can grant access <p> E-readers and E-books can have a big impact on raising the literacy level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places where library access is difficult or non-existent can gain exposure to a vast collection of literature curated online .

By utilizing e-books and e-readers across developing nations , we can simultaneously tackle the issues of literacy and digital literacy , skills that are necessary to succeed in the global economy . <p> One laptop per child is a great initiative , but has some drawbacks . In his TED Talk , Aleph Molinari discusses some of these drawbacks and posits an alternative : Community centers that teach digital literacy . His RIA centers provide internet access to the communities that need it , while at the same time , trains these communities to be digitally literate . Digitally enabling those without technological access does more than promote digital literacy , it gives them a voice . It allows their ideas to be amplified and heard across the globe . By analyzing the specific needs and demographics of a community and adapting to cater to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of technology that can lead to lasting change . <p> 3 . Making Smartphones Cheaper <p> The trend in technology is for our devices to get cheaper over time . Smartphones were once a status symbol for the elite , but today your 4-year-old niece probably plays with one . Beyond being just a toy to entertain a child , smartphones represent instant access to the flow of information . Because of this , they can help bridge the digital divide . India , for example , recently shipped a $10 dollar smart phone . By comparison , the latest blackberry will cost the average person $750 without a contract . In addition to internet access , smartphones can be used as e-readers and can allow teachers in these communities to practice mobile learning . <p> The future of global education is a mobile education . It is the most cost-effective way to bridge the digital divide and provide millions with access to the massive flow of information . By using solutions likeLiveTiles Mosaic , global educators and those with access to computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way , a teacher in Europe can curate relevant content and information for students in developing communities , which they can then access with their smartphones . As the screen shot below shows , these engaging digital classrooms combine everything students will need into a single eye-popping page which can be accessed with any digital device from anywhere . <p> Too often , we tend to see technology as the great equalizer . Yes , its true that digital solutions can be transformative , but what we often forget is that these solutions do not exist in a vacuum . There are economic , geographic , cultural and even political contexts that must be taken into account . Forced adoption of digital solutions tailored to the developed world is n't the answer by itself : the implementation of these solutions will save the day . <p> The technology that we bring into education must be sustainable . If not , then these solutions are nothing more than a false emancipation , one that gives the appearance of freedom , but does nothing to change the status quo . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can raise the standard of living for millions of people in need , we must apply the effort consistently and continuously . There is no technological substitute for this .

Hats off to those among us who can . But , given the saturation of web-accessible mobile devices among the average consumer , a business needs to pay close attention to how it chooses to develop mobile-friendly sites , pages , and business apps . For mobile-friendly web development , two methods stand out " mobile responsive design and mobile-specific page design . <p> The relative pros and cons of each approach can be debated endlessly . Some sources state that responsive pages are more suited to informationpresentation , instead of interactive functions . Others argue that the cost of developing a mobile-specific site is higher , while others say that the initial cost of developing a responsive site is higher ( though the ongoing maintenance is less costly than a mobile-specific site ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of time invested as well .

If you develop one responsive site to accommodate all devices , any fixes , updates , or revisions to the original code only need to occur in one place . If you 've built a separate mobile-specific version of the site , then you would have tomaintain two separate sites when updates or changes occur . Though many find a site with both a mobile-specific and a desktop version may be preferable , the ability to very quickly create responsive pages using LiveTiles Design means that a developer may no longer need to prioritize a page 's load time over the time cost of its maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy , you could very build a responsive page that is mobile-dedicated ( including only the elements your mobile employees require ) , in addition to a general page that also happens to be responsive . The development speed with LiveTiles Design allows you the freedom to build both , as well as maintain and update each with ease . <p> In addition to this ease of revision , you can useLiveTiles Design as a presentation layer and page designer with your business ' SharePoint or Office 365 mobile capabilities . While Office and SharePoint have their own set of mobile apps that carry their specific functions into mobile devices , with LiveTiles Design you can very quickly buildresponsive pages that include elements from across the Office suite of mobile apps and even beyond . Due to its easy to use drag-and-drop functions that allow you to design and redesign a page in minutes , LiveTiles Design can greatly quicken process of creating a page using mobile responsive design principles .

A member of a content marketing team on a mobile device might , for example , reference this page to check the status of content in progress in the mastersheet , confirm deadlines in the Marketing Calendar , and keep track of assigned tasks in the task list . <p> In short , mobile-dedicated sites and mobile responsive design pages both have their strong suits ( and weaknesses ) when you 're looking for a way to make your digital workplace mobile . With LiveTiles , however , you do n't necessarily have to choose between the two .

The idea is simple : There are some tasks that are better taken on by a team . <p> Digital solutions have allowed us to extend the notion of a team. - A team- can reach across the office just as easily as it can reach across borders or nations . And as a team gets bigger , sprouts new arms and takes on new members in different locations , it can become harder to manage . Fortunately , Microsoft SharePoint comes with out-of-the-box functionality that allows for team collaboration and let 's members keep track of each others progress . <p> Creating a SharePoint team site provides team members with a designated virtual space in which to collaborate , check in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oversee the collaboration effort , assign tasks and set permissions. - Team members can create a shared documents list to house all uploaded documents and then classify these documents for easy retrieval . SharePoint also allows for co-authoring of documents , so that two members can work collaboratively on the same document . <p> The idea is to centralize all relevant information so that any team member can have access to it , effectively boosting team collaboration . Features like universal search and status reports allow any employee to work autonomously , but remain in conjunction with the rest of the team . Furthermore , with built-in information alerts and audits , team members are kept up-to-date on the status of projects . <p> However , while SharePoint enables team collaboration , getting the most out of its functionality can be a complex task . This is where the LiveTiles SharePoint platform comes in . LiveTiles allows users to access the depth of SharePoints functionality all from an intuitive and customizable UI . It also gives users one-touch access to email and social media feeds , allowing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , LiveTiles Nintex workflow integration helps to keep teams on task by preventing time-sucking oversights . <p> How to Improve Team Collaboration with SharePoint <p> It is this ease of access baked into the LiveTiles SharePoint platform that really helps to ramp up SharePoint team collaboration . Let 's say , for example , that you work in the digital marketing department and you 're tasked with writing copy for a new product . LiveTiles gives you quick access to co-workers who might have pertinent product information , and also allows them to view the completed document as soon as its uploaded , regardless of where in the world they happen to be . <p> This may not be collaboration in the traditional sense , but digital technology has changed the nature of how we interact with one another . Digital solutions have had a considerable impact on what it is to be human . Some would argue that we have become more detached , more disconnected . It s true . Collaboration in the digital world means we are more likely to communicate through a glowing screen rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same office . However , it has also empowered us to be more autonomous , even as we work together . <p> Team collaboration has become a fluid concept , a merging of minds and principles that , having left behind the physical act , can happen at any time . It is in this sense that the term embodies the new virtual identities we have crafted for ourselves , an experience of independent parts all working towards a singular goal . This is the new normal . The new user experience . The thing about user experience is that it reflects the human experience , and the human experience is constantly changing .

Video lectures have left them with more class time with which to engage with their students and- mobile learning- has helped those same- students use something ubiquitous in everyday life as a platform for the learning process . However , - for those who have made to switch , it is important to address the issue of- cybersecurity . <p> Schools have always taken measures to ensure the safety of their students and faculty , whether it be by employing security guards or requiring staff to receive specific training in child safety . More than anything , - the school itself was the biggest safety measure , with students being kept safe inside- of- it . But- as aspects of education- are- increasingly digital , cybersecurity- has become a growing concern for school administrators , teachers and students. - It is essential that everyone involved in the educational system- be endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities and educational institutions . <h> The Problem With Cybersecurity <p> The very nature of the internet- makes- cybersecurity extremely- difficult . The internet was designed to- facilitate- the flow of information between computers at a time when- they were- expensive and- relatively- inaccessible. - Fast forward- to today where- 52.7- percent- of all internet access is made up by smartphone users and you begin to see the problem . The internet is less like a house with locked doors and windows and more like a hive , allowing users to come and go and access what they need . Putting in too many restrictions would have an adverse effect on- the flow of information . Basically , the- internet- would be nowhere near as useful . <p> This freedom to access- information- is what makes- the digital classroom such a powerful educational resource . Its why teachers are making the switch . They can curate lesson plans from a variety of different sources right at their fingertips . They can give students and parents access to- grades and post assignments- immediately , which students can then- view- from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digital classroom also makes it more- of- a security- liability- than , - say , a small business. - The entire pretense behind the digital classroom is that it is- always- online . When coupled with the- practices- of- mobile learning- and- BYOD , hackers have more access to the information stored on school servers- simply because students do , and it is much harder to regulate and secure these- mobile- devices . <p> Also , because most of their IT dollars- are allotted to- the- educational experience , many schools lack the resources to provide adequate cybersecurity . <h> Prevention <p> So how can we tackle these issues- without compromising the educational process ? Well , the first thing- to understand- is that good security enables , - rather than- inhibit. - That is , the digital classroom is more prone to- a breach in cybersecurity due to the transient nature of information . For this reason , - students need to be educated about cybersecurity- practices , - starting with proper web usage . They need to know how easily accessible- their- personal- information- is online . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites such as Facebook- and Instagram and make sure they- secure their information . It may seem basic , but this can go along way to protecting the digital identity of students . <p> Password security is also something schools should focus on when thinking abut revamping their cybersecurity . As much of an inconvenience- it is to go the extra mile , - passwords should be changed every month or so , and they should never be repeated . Hackers have a plethora of options when it comes to brute forcing their way- through- passwords , but longer digit passwords tend to be harder to crack. - Schools should also employ- multi-factor authentication in the same way companies- like- Google do , asking users to not only provide an email address and password , but also linking these to a phone number . <p> In recent years , - hackers have become- experts- at phishing , - or- the act of embedding malware in emails . One click and your computer or mobile device is infected . If you 're connected to a server- or- Wi-Fi- network , - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information- of- everyone who was- connected . Therefore , - it is important that students learn to be- responsible digital citizens and look out for suspicious activity . <p> Another way hackers phish is by embedding malware on popular websites . For this reason , students and faculty need to be aware of these sites so that they can better monitor student behavior online. - Teachers- need to enforce a balance between exploration and- cybersecurity . <h> Integrating- Mosaic <p> In order to enforce this balance , - educators need to have some- modicum- of control over the aspects of the- digital classroom. - LiveTiles Mosaic , while not a solution for hackers , gives educators a bit more control over the user-based element of- security breaches. - As the screen shot below illustrates , teachers can preload vetted resources into their- digital classroom using snippet tiles , - rather than have students scour the web for them , exposing their systems to dangerous malware in the process . On the social media front , while Mosaic is compatible with both- Facebook- and- Twitter , users can also implement a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service that restricts access- to those with- Microsoft email accounts. - - <p> By providing an efficient way to manage the digital classroom , Mosaic helps educators tackle the human error- portion of cybersecurity. - When teachers show students how to protect themselves from the threats they face on the Internet , - this safeguards- users at- the front end of cybersecurity- and- frees up educational institutions to outsource backend security to the- Cloud. - <h> Outsourcing Cybersecurity : - The Role of Cloud-based- Solutions <p> Putting all- of- your valuable data in one place may not seem like the best- idea , especially following- the recent- iCloud hack . However , the- perpetrators of that hack gained access due to a failure at the front end , not due- to- any failure in the actual security of the- Cloud . <p> The cornerstone of- Cloud security lies in encryption . All data should be encrypted before- reaching the- Cloud and double encryption should be the standard for all sensitive date- stored on the- Cloud . Because encrypting all data can be onerous and- impact- the user experience , schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Cloud-based services , - such as- Microsoft Azure , - allow for client side- encryption- of data . Once the sensitive data- is- encrypted client side , Azure generates an encrypted key with which to wrap the users encrypted data , effectively double encrypting the data until it is called on to be decrypted . <p> Beyond just providing users with a secure platform to house their data , being a Microsoft service makes Azure highly compatible with the Office 365 tenant . This makes it a natural choice for schools looking to digitize and store their data on the- Cloud , as it provides- security while optimizing the learning process . <h> Outsourcing Cybersecurity : Building Ethical Hackers <p> Another way to bolster cybersecurity is to promote ethical hacking . Today , the word hacking has a negative- connotation- attached to it . We think hacking and we think of the black hats , the people who exploit oversights in cybersecurity for personal gain. - But- by- encouraging ethical hacking in an educational sense , educators can- provide a- deeper understanding of computers and their security . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers turn this into an educational experience ? One common example is that teachers can assign students- to hack into the schools database for the purposes of exposing flaws in the schools security system. - This- assignment- can bolster future efforts to improve cybersecurity. - By providing students with a better- understanding- of the systems they use on a daily basis , we enable them to better protect themselves , which in turn- strengthens the cybersecurity of the educational institution . <p> Furthermore , - computer science is our future . The physical aspects of our personal lives are becoming digital at a rapid rate , and schools- are starting to- see the need- for a- computer science- curriculum. - A report by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education- states that by 2018 , - 50% of high schools- in the United States- will have some form of- rigorous- computer science program . The same report also states that by- 2018 , - 25% of states will institute cybersecurity education standards for grades K-12 . These future hackers and coders are our best line of defense against the hackers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage- with computers in- more meaningful ways- is the best way to level the playing field . <p> The threat of- a- cyber attack shouldnt keep- teachers- from adopting the digital classroom model . Instead , - it should- reinforce- the need for cybersecurity across all aspects of our digital lives , - including the classroom . A digital education is the future , - and when armed with the proper knowledge and strategies , - students and teachers can help to mitigate cyber threats . And while no platform is ever 100 percent secure from- a cyber attack , - we can not let fear of these attacks dictate- our lives . Instead , we need to use- these threats- to inform- ourselves about cybersecurity- and adapt to- the- changing digital climate. - -

Over time , it has become one of the most widely used digital platforms in workplaces " its been deployed in many organizations to enhance the ability for staff members to work together and be more productive . <p> As a flagship product of Microsoft , Office 365 and SharePoint have massively broadened the scope of how businesses can better handle document management . Working on projects together is made simpler because of the categorization of sites and pages in one centralized location . Clearly , SharePoint integration is a huge commodity businesses can latch onto . <p> Additionally , Microsoft SharePoint users are able to majorly benefit from SharePoint ROI , which put simply is the profit calculated as percentage of money invested in anything imported into SharePoint . <h> What are the Problems with Traditional SharePoint ROI and Current SharePoint Practices ? <p> Much of the issue with traditional SharePoint ROI is its lack of utilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some companies who have not yet updated their current business solutions <p> Most system integrators , small and large , are basically physically installing SharePoint " boxes " in companies in a server room so that the solution can be used internally . Typically , they plug solutions into servers for a group of maybe 50 people , for instance . These solutions may vary but are usually for programs like Exchange , Word and many other Microsoft applications . They may have also set up e-mail on one of the servers , however email has limited capabilities and does not possess the same success as SharePoint ROI . <p> So what issues arise in the midst of this outdated solution process ? It is common that , especially in the entry level stages of enterprise software integration , that there could be some bugs or some minor malfunctions . In the traditional business process , the customer would then have to receive further physical consultation to rectify the situation . So the customer would have to constantly have a systems integrator monitoring the servers . <p> The problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very costly to the customer . This is why the traditional business of SharePoint on premise is dying out and conversely shifting people to the cloud which is migrating and doing any infrastructure to the cloud is a very low margin business . These businesses are realizing that on-premise is no longer providing them a sufficient SharePoint ROI . <h> Why Does SharePoint Provide a Higher ROI ? <p> With a SharePoint practice , you can engage with the customer at a strategic level " you can offer high value services and because you can do so , you can start businesses with more resources and higher margins , and ultimate reach a successful SharePoint ROI for them . <p> With SharePoint ROI , business tasks are easier to deploy with SharePoint , the turnaround time is much shorter in comparison to alternative enterprise solutions . When assisting customers , you 'll see that you can complete more projects at a rapid pace and as such you 'll will have more time to take on additional projects and gain more revenue . <p> Once system integrators have mastered the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun their path to a successful SharePoint ROI and hopefully started creating a reputation for themselves . Studies show that most forward thinking customers find that profitability , strong relationships and reputation in the market are attractive qualities to keep in mind when seeking system integrators or vendors for their business solutions . <p> Although software has recently become very consumer friendly , the need for support regarding integration , pricing , resource management and the like are still very much important . And this is where being skilled in this trade will provide a long lasting SharePoint ROI . <p> So , being a specialized system integrator will is beneficial because even though the customer is perfectly capable of using the solution without consultation , there are specialized areas within and around the software that a systems integrator will typically have expertise in . This becomes a major return on investment as being specialized in a business solution like SharePoint can be a huge commodity in the IT sector . <h> Types of Investments Required with SharePoint ROI <p> The first investment you must make when integrating in Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the workplace in a centralized location for simplified access and successful streamlining of information . In order to do this , you must first understand how to create a SharePoint practice and how to run a SharePoint workshop . <p> Creating a SharePoint team is the first step in starting a SharePoint practice and investing in SharePoint ROI . A SharePoint team will usually consist of a sales person , a project coordinator , a SharePoint consultant and a more technical person . Having skilled IT professionals within the company to fill the technical role in a SharePoint team can really shape teams that that are able to effectively harness all the functions SharePoint has to offer . Another method in creating and sustaining a SharePoint Practice is conducting SharePoint workshops . Workshops will implement strategies to educate and inform new users on SharePoint best practices , and go-hand-in-hand with user adoption of SharePoint . User adoption is also an important step in the process of creating a SharePoint practice ; conducting focus groups , having staff members test the solution , and encouraging feedback inspires forward thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective clients is the amount money you put into a SharePoint project . As previously mentioned , you 'd have to invest some finances into creating a SharePoint team to make sure it is comprised of seasoned representatives to consult and configure the best solutions for a customer . Additionally , once you 've created a SharePoint team , there comes the time to run the necessary SharePoint workshops . So , funding these workshops are essential to partners and customers alike to get a firm grasp on the benefits SharePoint provides . <p> SharePoint is an investment that does not get wholly replaced " new versions are built on top of existing collateral to sustain and enhance workplace functionality . And this is where the attraction from customers comes into play . The highly specialized knowledge in a SharePoint practice creates customer lifetime value . And customer lifetime value is the goal of any systems integrator " to maintain a long lasting relationship with each of their customers that will not wain off or only be a temporary deal . <p> SharePoint via LiveTiles lends itself well to meeting a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has loads of functionality , and has capability to meet demonstrated solutions for customers . Because the majority of purchasers are business-consumer users , you can generate ROI on a SharePoint practice in the long term by being trained in catering to their business needs . LiveTiles software can put all these functionalities into one single pane of glass , which means that all of your digital components are conveniently located in one location " so you do n't  have to put in time and money to deeply customize SharePoint out of the box . Below is what SharePoint can look like using LiveTiles . <h> How Can SharePoint ROI Provide a Higher Revenue ? <p> There are some rather large selling points in creating a SharePoint practice for your customers . Return on investment via SharePoint will provide reduced business risk , faster and better decision making , increased output and ultimately a massive decrease in the cost of integrating such solutions . And as previously stated , because of the rapid streamlining of the workflow , customers can look forward to further project development . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your customers . Return on investment via SharePoint will provide reduced business risk , faster and better decision making , increased output and ultimately a massive decrease in the cost of integrating such solutions . And as previously stated , because of the rapid streamlining of the workflow , customers can look forward to further project development . <p> So , by integrating features like data analytics and automation of tasks for your customers , you are eliminating room for errors in their work initiatives . So in turn , less effort and responsibility is put into trying to find and correct these errors . Because of this , businesses are able to save a massive amount of time on projects so they can move on to other projects and increased revenue . <p> Customers are easily adopting the multifaceted platform and in turn are more productive and more engaged in their initiatives . As a result , users found that they were able to increase the ROI of their existing projects by deploying them more broadly . <p> Via Microsoft partners , customers have drastically experienced an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , these savings in time freed up staff to focus on other activities and to handle additional output with the same amount of effort . In several cases , the productivity gains led to staffing cost reductions or avoided costs . <p> SharePoint ROI minimizes the investment needed and maximizes the return or economic value of an enterprise so of course it is something that should be strongly considered for enterprise deployment . <p> SharePoint ROI is the wave of the future " Microsoft partners should want to be facilitators of this business model and theyll find that their customers will be more than satisfied with this solution at their disposal . And to just glance at it from an IT perspective , SharePoint ROI will supply faster development of integration and deployment , extended lines of business and ultimately reduced service and/or support costs . <p> The take away here is that partners can implement a SharePoint practice for their customers which will help their customers to monetize more on their own projects . In turn partners will be able to take on more customers and increase ROI for themselves as well with SharePoint ROI .

However , there is one aspect of education that has remained predominantly tech free : physical education . <p> And why should technology be associated with physical education ? After all , a popular complaint of many modern day parents is that their kids spend too much time on their computers and not enough time playing outside . Statistics back this up : One out of every three children in the United States is obese . With statistics like these , it is understandable that parents want to keep technology out of physical education . However , we can not overlook the potential of digital solutions to change the way we interact with our environments , especially in a physical way . <p> Coaches and gym teachers can use apps to track their students ' physical activities and stats outside of school and assign daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fitbit bracelets add a visual element to physical activities , providing students with a digital representation of their activity level .

They can also assign different types of physical activities such as bike riding or hiking , allowing students to swap out one activity they do n't like for another they do . <p> Furthermore , with access to online resources , physical educators can greatly expand what constitutes a physical education . There are plenty of online instructionals for Yoga and Zumba that be implemented in class to give students a break from the norm . But beyond just raising levels of student engagement and changing up the curriculum , digital solutions can help can help extend the educators influence outside of the gymnasium and into the classroom . <p> Student athletics is a serious business .

Rather than attempting to anticipate each customized need , the development team has opted to provide an easy and intuitive framework to allow customers to create their own tiles . <p> LiveTiles makes use of a standard programming practice called Object-Oriented Programming , which conceptualizes programs as being made of various actors ( Objects ) that interact with one another . One of the cornerstones of this paradigm is the concept of inheritance , which allows programmers to take existing object definitions and extend them with custom properties and behaviors . <p> This feature will greatly facilitate custom tile design . Since the basic tile behavior is already defined for them , a custom tile author will only need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct , while having the option to override any of these defaults . For example , a basic tile defines properties such as its height , width , whether it appears in the background or foreground of a page , etc. , and defines standard behaviors such as opening the configuration dialog when double-clicked , dragging around on the page while the mouse button is held , etc . A tile author can customize any aspect of this , and for their part will really only need to specify how the tile loads ( e.g. if it needs to load data from a site ) , what configurable properties it will have and what template it will use when figuring out how to display itself . <p> LiveTiles also adheres closely to the programming concept of modularity , which takes the entire program and splits it up into separate pieces , with each representing a logical component that goes into making the whole structure work . The logic for the LiveTiles Designer , for example , is contained within its own module , and the default definitions for a Tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire program more organized , but also greatly eases the learning curve for custom tile authors . Rather than needing to trudge through the entire codebase to figure out what they need , they will likely only need to deal with 3-4 different , clearly defined modules at any one time . <p> LiveTiles runs in a user 's browser , and thus makes use of the language Javascript . Javascript is especially strange among programming languages because it does n't yet have a built-in system for creating modular code . The LiveTiles development team employs a few different technologies to work around this . One of them is a Javascript library called RequireJS , which introduces a means for defining modules into the language . Another is a particular dialect of Javascript , called Typescript , which not only works in conjunction with RequireJS to enable modular coding practices , but also allows the LiveTiles developers to mark each module with a variety of annotations that clarify how the modules are to be used and warn the customer if they happen to use them incorrectly . <p> Custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any workplace environment , and the development team has striven to make the process as easy and efficient as possible . The development team has taken Object-Oriented Programming and modularity as their core guiding principles in the coding and design of the product . It is our hope that this will yield easy-to-understand code and will allow customers to create the exact kind of intuitive and enjoyable user-experience they want from their pages .

Where did they all come from ? They 've sprung up like weeds . Since the Great Recession , more American consumersare shopping with resale value in mind . Preowned goods , formerly gauche , have acquired a thrifty chic , and are popular with price-sensitive younger shoppers who value purchases with low environmental impact . Traditional consignment storeshave been quick to respond to this demographic ; online consignment stores , armed with the same advantages as online retailers , are willing to take a smaller slice of transactions while connecting potentially vast numbers of value-minded consumers . While there have been some failures , reports of triple digit sales growth and successive rounds of raised capitalfor other firms indicate major players and investors alike are bullish on the growing online consignment industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They 'll need every employee , from managers to associates , collaborating and sharing resources on one unifying platform .

The goal is to teach design thinking to those who will be making up the global workforce of the future . With the advent of the digital classroom , it can be easy to ignore the human element of education . Design thinking concerns itself primarily with this human element . It is a customer-centric way of thinking , one that stresses empathy and can be applied to numerous facets of life . <p> Recently , Simon Tyrrell , Todd Schutz , Sam Randall and Fred Showell of the LiveTiles Team traveled to Rokeby High School in Tasmania . They worked with 25 students and two teachers and wound up getting some pretty great ideas for using digital solutions to reform education . For example , the kids came up with ideas for apps , like one that calls out bullies and connects their victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help with self-improvement . <p> If we think of education as a business , then the students are the clients . Their input should be sought after because they are the ones consuming the product , and any product that does n't take into account the needs of its users is fatally flawed . This is the heart of design thinking and what the Designathon is all about : teaching students how to think , not what to think . <p> As Showell , our UX Lead puts it , " The key concept around LiveTiles in education is around democratic design . Taking the page design and creation out of the hands of IT experts and giving educators and students the power to create on-the-fly in the classroom . " <p> Critics of design thinking argue that it is too ideation-based , ending in brainstorming sessions that do n't produce results , or produce results devoid of the energetic mess of creativity . This is what LiveTiles ' Designathons address . If you 've read our last Designathon blog , you know that Tyrrells process does n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas- all the way to the prototype stage , the most crucial part of the process . If there are any flaws , they 'll be exposed in this stage , forcing the students to address the issue head-on . <p> Design thinking is the foundation for creating future innovators and LiveTiles is proud to play a role in promoting education reform principles . We believe that students should be able to put themselves in each others shoes so that they can work together to tackle challenges and solve conflicts . <p> " I see LiveTiles as a way to bridge the gap between ideation and results . By allowing students the power to take their ideas and design , get feedback , refine and get to a state in which they have something that not only brings their ideas to life , but allows them to create something in which they have pride , will give the students the drive and tools needed to get further in their education . " Todd Schutz , Associate Product Manager <p> Most importantly , the Designathon aims to- bridge the digital divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These students are bright and want to be the next entrepreneurs , but they do n't  always have access to the latest digital technology . <p> We understand that we may not be able to address all of the socio-economic issues they face , but Designathons can help foster ideas and great ideas can change the world . The students who participated in our Designathons have great ideas and we allow them to bring them out in the open . Because we are committed to addressing the digital divide , we offer our education product LiveTiles Mosaic for free to any K-12 class . <p> Beyond Designathons , LiveTiles gives users the ability to build a foundation from which to launch their future endeavors . It let 's them build better . Whether designing a beautiful employee dashboard- or- creating a more engaging UX , we give users the tools they need to shape the world .

To combat this as well as boost employee productivity , a recent trend in the new age workplace environment is to offer workplace yoga or meditation sessions . However , even as startups and small businesses transform to provide environments that foster engagement and creativity , if the digital workplace does n't  provide its users with the responsiveness or flexibility they enjoy in the physical workplace , productivity is hampered . This is one of the complaints concerning SharePoint design . <p> SharePoint , for all its functionality , is notorious for being unintuitive and uninspiring . The LiveTiles platform addresses this by adding a layer of intuitive UI over SharePoints UI and allowing SharePoint designers to access that deep functionality in minutes . It effectively simplifies SharePoint design to a series of drag and drops . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from a library of over fifty tiles such as the Cloud Documents tile or the Power BI tile in order to craft an intranet that is equal parts sleek and responsive , as well as powerful . And with new features auto-released every two weeks , SharePoint designers can continually build in functionality quickly and easily . <p> More so , the LiveTiles platform allows users to do more from a single screen , integrating site collections and disparate apps into a flexible ecosystem . In contrast to the rigidity of the SharePoint platform , the LiveTiles platform allows the user- easier access to what they need in order to boost productivity . This could be access to cloud documents , access to email , a Spotify playlist or the company Yammer feed . In this way LiveTiles is like yoga for the SharePoint soul , imbuing SharePoint design with freedom of movement between digital solutions , co-workers and social networks . At the same time it makes more complex or tedious tasks , like migrating information architecture , much simpler . Where , in the physical world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance between the mental and physical , LiveTiles unlocks productivity by balancing functionality with an intuitive and responsive design . <p> Seasoned SharePoint designers and new users alike are empowered- to make quick , but efficient changes to a site or site collection in order to meet new business needs . Furthermore , LiveTiles intuitive UI allows end users to quickly make changes to the intranet while SharePoint designers can focus on the more complex aspects of SharePoint design . <p> The big plus when it comes to backend SharePoint design is that LiveTiles does n't  reinvent the wheel , it- just provides intuitive access to it . All the key mechanisms for IA , list/library data storage and permissions are respected , making scalability relatively straightforward . Developers can easily access in-built APIs or incorporate vendor specific APIs if they need to . More so , LiveTiles responsive canvas gives SharePoint a much needed mobile facelift . This allows developers to design for mobile in a device agnostic way and make changes on the fly . Being able to design effectively yet efficiently for mobile is a major element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of work cuts ties with the paradigms of the early 20th century .

There is an age old adage that speaks of the stiffest branch being the most easily broken . This is true just as much in the digital world as it is in the physical . Our new-age bodies spend an incredible amount of time confined in tight spaces . We mash ourselves together on public transportation , pack ourselves into traditional offices and hunker down in front of screens for hours on end . This can have a detrimental effect on our physique , and so it is no wonder that the yoga industry has grown so rapidly . It gradually allows us to reshape our bodies and their boundaries .

@@109788916 @5188916/ <h> Integrating mobile learning into the classroom <p> At the height of the digital revolution , teachers everywhere established a strict no cell phone use in the classroom policy in an effort to control their students . Their intentions were noble : They wanted to ensure that their students would avoid digital distraction and pay attention in class . Today , as digital technology permeates all aspects of students lives , teachers are embracing the mobile learning phenomenon . <p> What explains this sudden shift ? Its not that students have suddenly started to use technology less , or that technology developments have slowed down . To the contrary , students have established a " second self " online , and their smart phones , which are always on and always on them , serve as digital limbs . <p> Instead , the rest of the world has learned to adapt to the digital natives . This includes teachers , who increasingly must meet todays students where they are if they want to succeed . And where are todays students ? Somewhere between the digital realm and physical realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Who Do Some Teachers Resist Mobile Learning ? <p> Mobile learning is learning across different mobile devices , and its related to the latest bring your own device ( BYOD ) trend that is taking over the workplace . Rather than have students use a schools outdated technology , or worse , no technology at all , the concept of mobile learning presumes that students prefer to use their personal devices . In a sense , students can bring the classroom with them when they go to school in the morning , and take it with them when they leave in the afternoon . <p> There are many benefits to this , but before discussing them , its important to acknowledge the perceived drawbacks . There are five reasons why some teachers are still reluctant to integrate mobile learning into the classroom . They are : <p> These fears are understandable , if unrealistic . While its true that there are negative aspects of digital technology , and in a mobile learning environment , some students will take advantage , the same amount of students already take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about technology integration , but such worries assume that all is well with the traditional classroom . This couldnt be further from the truth . In fact , many of the scenarios teachers fear with mobile learning are already happening in the traditional classroom . <h> Mobile Learning Enhances Student Engagement <p> In the traditional classroom , teachers struggle to engage their students . Part of this has to due with the generally acknowledged truth that school is an obligation for students and theyd much rather be playing outside with their friends . When students have to sit in a classroom for days on end , it makes sense that theyd get bored from time to time . <p> However , education experts are starting to realize that students are also distracted in the classroom because traditional teaching practices fail to excite them . Rote memorization , oral recitations and standardized test do n't  give students a reason to pay attention and love school . The same dry , stale textbooks are n't  exactly the page turners that will entice students to read . In other words , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to do on a day-to-day basis is boring . <p> Teachers can change this by integrating mobile learning into the classroom . The simplest way to do this is to use LiveTiles Mosaic to design an exciting digital classroom . Mosaic is a free UI design solution that sits on top of SharePoint and can be used by any K-12 class with an Office 365 tenant . With its user-friendly drag and drop function , teachers can add pre-configured Office 365 apps like Word , OneNote and PowerPoint and cloud-based services like Yammer and OneDrive to make learning fun again . As the screen shot below illustrates , this mobile-friendly digital classroom is bound to engage students . <h> Students Can Learn How to Combat Screen Addiction <p> Its reasonable for teachers to worry about screen addiction , but mobile learning wont cause it . Just like schools do with drugs and alcohol , teachers can show students the negative consequences of screen addiction , and how to develop a healthy relationship with their mobile devices . This is one of the key aspects of mobile learning " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let their devices control them . <p> Easier said than done , perhaps , but teachers can use Mosaic to inform students about screen addiction . For example , the Ted Talks tile can lead students to intriguing videos in which medical professionals discuss addiction . Ted Talks videos like Judson Brewers nine minute " A simple way to break a bad habit " will cause students to think about the ways they 're using digital technology , and whether or not they have to change their practices to avoid addiction . <p> Still , teachers can only do so much . They are n't  responsible for their students lifestyle choices outside of class , and they should n't be held accountable if one of their students develops an unhealthy addiction to digital technology . <h> The Digital Classroom is Not a Place for Cyber-Bullies <p> Its true that bullying is a problem , but as youth researchers Alice Marwick and dinah boyd point out in their op-ed published in The New York Times , teachers should distinguish between legitimate , life-threatening bullying and the daily dramas of teenage life . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today has existed for decades , and is just part of growing up . <p> At the same time , journalist Emily Bazelon makes an interesting point when she posits that the so-called " bullying epidemic " may be overstated , however todays cyber-bullying is more powerful than yesterdays traditional schoolyard bullying because it can occur 24/7 . <p> Teachers should n't worry too much , though , because they can monitor their students interactions in the digital classroom across mobile devices and quickly take action if there is ever a legitimate case of cyber-bullying . While teachers ca n't be the protectors of the world , they can ensure that the digital classroom is a safe space where cyber-bullying will not be tolerated . <p> How do teachers do this , exactly ? With Mosaic , teachers can add a Yammer tile to the digital classroom and moderate the interactions . Yammer is a fun social media tool that allows students and teachers to converse outside of school . Students can use Yammer to ask questions or share important insights about a particular subject , and teachers can use it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many benefits , and teachers should n't let a few cyber-bullies ruin it for everyone . <p> Since Yammer is a social space , and since students will access it outside of class , teachers may fear that some students will engage in cyber-bullying . These fears are unfounded because teachers can regulate the Yammer feed and immediately remove any offensive or inappropriate content . <h> Mobile Learning Encourages Creativity <p> Why do students cheat ? This is an age-old question that teachers are still trying to solve . Some students cheat because they are pressed for time , but many others do so because they do not feel as if the assignment matters , such as homework or other " busywork . " Students will be less likely to cheat if they feel as if their assignments have educational value . <p> Mobile learning encourages classroom creativity and allows students to feel invested in their work . With Mosaic , teachers can add the Sway tile and have their students create interactive websites . Perhaps teachers can weave in a lesson about plagiarism in the process . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the implications of cheating , how to source materials or the fine line between copying and " culture jamming . " This can be a fun way to engage students with their work and educate them about the consequences of cheating . <p> If teachers use Sway to assign interactive group work , they can make cheating somewhat inconsequential . That is , by encouraging students to work together , the idea of copying another students work would n't be an issue . Classroom collaboration would be the new norm , and students would be expected to share their ideas and insights with each other . <p> What about those students who may skate by without putting in as much effort as others ? To avoid this , teachers can ensure that the collaborative assignments are engaging " something students do n't  mind completing . Its also fair to assume that if students have to work together , those typically lazy students will feel pressured to put in their fair share . It sounds a bit mischievous , but a little social shaming goes a long way , and lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacking off on collaborative assignments . <p> Many education experts believe that collaborative assignments benefit students , which means that classroom collaboration would simultaneously solve the cheating problem and make students more proficient in their studies . <h> Teachers Can Still Make a Difference <p> Perhaps the biggest reason why teachers are reluctant to integrate mobile learning is that they fear digital technology will replace them . These technophobic concerns can be situated within a broader historical context , in which a panicked group of people have always warned about the technology takeover . <p> In the 19th century , for example , the Luddites rejected the newly developed technologies in England because they believed this technology would lower their wages , or worse , replace their jobs entirely . <p> then , that those remaining teachers who wont embrace mobile learning are thinking about the future of their careers , and whether or not theyll be needed in decades to come . <p> The truth is that technology , for all of its wonderful benefits , can not replace teachers . Think about it : Just as the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity and improved student engagement , the advent of digital technology will similarly make teachers and students more effective . That being said , teachers who embrace technology are more likely to succeed than those who resist the inevitable digital revolution . <p> Technology is just a tool , and its up to the individual to decide how to use it . Committed teachers who seriously think about exciting ways to integrate mobile learning will actually be more involved in the learning process because they will need to guide their students in the right direction . Its not productive or practical for teachers to put students in front of their mobile devices and let them run wild . Basic teacher skills like efficient classroom management , engaging instruction and effective student engagement will still apply . <p> Ultimately , in order for mobile learning to be successful , teachers will be needed to guide their students to use digital technology in productive ways . By creating a digital classroom , teachers will be one step closer to achieving this goal .

Is it any wonder that at least 50 percent of digital marketing campaigns fail ? <p> This is what Jason Falls , founder and partner in the Conversation Research Institute , describes as the biggest marketing mistake . The problem with marketing teams , he believes , " is not having enough understanding of their audience and assuming too much when building strategies .

" Pablo Picasso- <p> There 's an assumption out there that inspiration comes to a person out of nowhere . That the most innovative ideas spring from the heavens and enter an entrepreneurs mind at some odd hour in the morning . This assumption is false . As artists like Picasso , quoted above , remind us , inspiration is a combination of hard work , trial and error . Or as Bruce Springsteen once sang , " Spend your life waiting for a moment that just do n't  come , well do n't  waste your time waiting . " <p> The point remains the same : Innovative ideas do n't  come to you , you have to find them .

We also have bi-weekly meetings in which each member of the company shares what he or she is doing . We do this because we want everyone at the company to feel part of a community . Only then will everyone be working toward the same goal : to grow the company and ensure its sustained success . <h> - 5. - Use technology to eliminate time-consuming tasks <p> According to Tom Goodwin , in order for businesses to be innovative , there needs to be a " fundamental rewiring of business from the core .

We believe that there are three ways early childhood ed tech programs can help low-income students succeed . <h> 3 Benefits of Early Childhood Ed Tech : <p> 1 . Accessibility <p> According to a 2015 survey , nearly two-thirds of Americans ( 64% ) own a smartphone . And while laptops and tablets have become ubiquitous , for a fraction of low-income students , the internet is solely accessible via smartphones . Educational apps designed specifically for smartphones circumvent the issue of accessibility that can hinder early childhood education . <p> 2 .

This , in turn , improves their chances of social mobility going forward , as they are more prepared to use technology in high school , college and the digital workplace . <p> Education has always been a game of resources : Those with more receive a better one . By implementing tech-based solutions such as educational apps , we can not only increase the number of resources available to children from low-income families , but better prepare them for the ever-evolving digital workplace . <p> Summative Assessment . Midterms . Finals . Historically , this has been the focus of the American educator . But as we move into thedigital classroom , teachers are beginning to worry more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Students are more than just numbers and statistics , more than just groups of percentiles . Students are individuals . And with the help of some innovative digital tools , educators can grade these students more efficiently , and also glean important information from these grades in order to provide a better learning experience . <p> This is called formative assessment , and along withpersonalized learning , it is the future of education . The following list highlights some digital tools that help educators implement formative assessment techniques in a timely manner . <p> Naiku is a digital platform that allows educators to assess students understanding of classroom material . By providing instant feedback , educators get a clearer picture of student comprehension . A versatile tool in the classroom , Naiku features automatic assessment grading , as well as automatic transfer of grades . It is able to scan bubble sheets and monitor assessment when educators or learners are outside of the classroom via the cloud . <p> Furthermore , educators can conduct class polls in real-time in order to gauge understanding . With the changing climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevance of standardized testing , Naiku is a refreshing tool that emphasizes the importance of how we learn , rather than the test results .

WriterKey <p> WriterKey is a web-based application that aims to help educators improve the teaching and assessment of writing across the curriculum . All you need is internet access to use the app on any mobile device , or in conjunction with Google and Google Drive . <p> One of the key features of the app is the digital portfolio . This allows educators to access and assess a students work overtime through different grade levels . WriterKey features real-time feedback and stores all feedback and notes digitally. - This creates an environment that enables teachers not only to track progress , but to encourage revision and offer clear constructive criticism .

EssayTagger <p> EssayTagger is a web-based essay grading tool created by a teacher to alleviate some of the tedium of grading . This is not an auto-grader ; it still requires educators to do the work . However , it does help streamline the grading process . <p> EssayTagger makes it easy to identify the core elements of student essays and then evaluate them with a custom rubric designed by the educator . As is the norm these days , users of EssayTagger can provide feedback that will automatically be saved on the web , and make edits as they see fit . As more papers are graded on EssayTagger , more comments will be compiled and saved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments . <p> 5 . Nearpod <p> Nearpod has the same standard features of many formative assessment platforms . What sets it apart , however , is that it can be used by teachers to create web-based presentations and sync all students devices to them . From there , teachers can either guide learners through the presentations or allow them to participate in self-guided instruction . <p> Moreover , since Nearpod is mobile responsive , it encourages a responsible culture of consumption , rather than penalize students for using what has become a modern life staple . <p> In an open letterto his daughter , Mark Zuckerberg recently stressed the importance of personalized learning and the impact it will have on future generations . Although still in its infancy , with further development and investment , personalized learning has the potential to not only change the way we think about education , but make quality education more accessible . <p> The foundations of personalized learning , or adaptive learning to some , - are Learner Profiles and PLPs ( Personalized Learning Plans ) . <p> Learner profiles document individual students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other important data . They allow teachers to better visualize and access the needs of a student and implement a personalized learning plan for that student . <p> PLPs are strategies created from learner profiles for achieving academic success based on individual needs .

Here are five that are being instituted in the digital classroomright now . <h> 5 Personalized Learning Platforms : <p> 1 . Gooru : Gooru is a learning navigator that allows teachers to curate content from multimedia to digital textbooks , making them instantly accessible to K-12 students . Students also have access to real-time data , helping them understand exactly what is required to reach their goals . <p> 2 .

Zuckerberg understands this , and sees these challenges as a further call to action . As he so aptly says , " Once we understand the world we can create for your generation , we have a responsibility as a society to focus our investments on the future to make this reality . " <p> Just because you 've finished school and are working a full-time job does n't mean that you should stop developing new skills .

For example Twitter has launched a program designed to train participating employees in programming and software engineering skills . There are also services like Udacity 's Nanodegrees , which provide credentialed programs in such skills as Programming , Data Analysis , and Web Development . <p> Nintex , a pioneer in the Microsoft SharePoint add-on space , also offers Nintex Certificates that demonstrate an employee 's proficiency with Nintex systems .

The purpose of this training is to utilize continuing education to enhance the abilities of the employees , and at the same time the business as a whole , in using new technologies that facilitate productivity . <p> Obtaining knowledge and adapting to technological change is always a valuable goal , regardless of age . However , for today 's businesses such continuing education can be beneficial to success. - Thankfully , there are many solutions out there for companies trying to integrate continuing education into their workplace . <p> WhenChristopher Ward saw his mother for the first time , he remarked on how pretty she was .

" <p> However , as Gates himself admits , this is merely an assumption.University bureaucracy is a real problem . It can hinder educational goals and bog down students with unnecessary and onerous procedures . All of this works to stifle motivation . If students are unhappy with the administration , it really wont matter how much tech you throw at them in the classroom . <p> Beyond these two issues , however , Gates makes many profound points about ed tech . For example , he rightfully argues that VR could be used to positively augment the learning experience and expand the boundaries of the classroom , especially in certain fields like engineering . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of design , lots of engineering things , there 's lots of places where it will play a practical role and hopefully draw people in . Even if you cant , say , build a car in the virtual world , you can sit there and put the pieces together . " <p> In addition , Gates warns about the potential risk factor of too much tech in the classroom , and how it can become a distraction . This further emphasizes the need for a healthy relationship between tech developers and the educators who employ their products . <p> If we can successfully cultivate this relationship , we can encourage a healthy consumption of media and use it to facilitate learning , all while progressing smoothly past some issues like unintuitive UIs and unnecessary- bureaucracies.

Its easy to forget this as we take advantage of the current digital workplace and all its complex tools . However , it if werent for the basic PC , we would n't be where we are today . With so much sophisticated technology around us , its only bound to get more interesting . <p> " Ever since the introduction of the PC into the workplace we have been finding ever more- useful ways to harness its potential to save workers from the repetitive manual tasks and let them focus their time on more meaningful tasks . " <p> Cameron Dwyer sees the digital workplace we experience today as an evolution of previous technological eras that have emerged since the introduction of the PC . For example , the " Paperless Office " era found everyone in the office scrambling to transfer paper files onto computers . This was considered a revolutionary advancement at that time . Its truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced . <p> Social media has exploded and innovative mobile devices allow workers to collaborate anytime , anywhere , with almost anyone . Though its all about continuity and change , according to Dwyer the goal still remains the same : simplification . <p> " To me the digital workplace is to be able to simply open a laptop , anytime , anywhere and do my job If a bolt of lightning strikes that laptop , I just grab another and within a few hours my workplace is back to where I was . " <p> How will the digital workplace evolve in the future ? In Dwyer 's opinion , the digital workplace has potential to spill over into ones " digital home life . " Today , programs like Skype and Dropbox are used for both personal and professional purposes . Dwyer believes the industry will create more applications such as these that can be utilized in both the work and home settings . <p> " The problem now is n't digitizing information , the problem is how to get the right information to the right people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The digital workplace has to be navigated carefully . Dwyer notes that the massive amounts of information can be bombarding and users must cope with " all that noise . " With existence of Facebook , Yammer , SharePoint , Twitter , Skype and more , its easy to feel overwhelmed by emerging social media platforms . <p> For those who can sift through the excess information , the digital workplace has enormous benefits , Dwyer concludes . Evolving technology has broken down geographical communication barriers . Employees are happier because mobile devices provide more flexibility with work schedules . Organizations are run more efficiently as governance is centralized . There are also environmental benefits , as companies travel less and save paper . <p> " It 's critical to see the world from the eyes of your users . " <p> As an expert on end user tools , Dwyer stresses that businesses should provide a personalized cross section of partial systems to users , since users do n't  use every aspect of each system . An example is OnePlaceLive , a product Dwyer has been developing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need it . <p> Those who can filter the endless flow of information will find that there is much to love about the digital workplace . Its always expanding and only the most progressive tech minds know what 's on the horizon . <p> We would like to thank Cameron Dwyer for his expertise . <p> About Cameron Dwyer:Cameron has a passion for delivering optimized business processes through the application of technology .

@@109788989 @5188989/ <h> 3 Fascinating Ways Digital Technology Encourages Adult Education 172296 @qwx1032296 <p> Jul 20 , 2016 <p> Digital technology is n't just disrupting teaching practices in the classroom , but also our conceptions of what a classroom consists of and who can enter this sacred education space . When we focus on education , we tend to place an emphasis on K-12 and higher ed , often neglecting those seasoned individuals who do n't  fit the typical mode . This is unfortunate , but thanks to digital technology , more people are starting to embrace the concept of adult education . <h> 3 Ways Digital Technology Encourages Adult Education : <p> 1 . The Technical Aspect : Education anytime , anywhere <p> If there 's one thing that defines digital education , its instant access to learning materials across different mobile devices . That is , teachers and students do n't  have to rely solely on the physical classroom space and the traditional class schedule to communicate . They can use cloud-based technologies and mobile devices to take the learning environment with them wherever they go . <p> There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many of them traditionally could not because school hours conflicted with work or they did n't  have the funds to earn a higher degree . Online GED and higher education classes andMOOCs for credit change this by allowing adults to earn their degrees on their own time , often for free or at limited expense . <p> Moreover , since many adults have to use technology in order to take these classes , there is a significant closing of the generational knowledge gap betweendigital natives and digital immigrants . When all participants must use the same technology to learn , this has the potential to put everyone on an equal playing field in their post-education endeavors . <p> When students of all backgrounds are enrolled in a class , participants are inevitably going to be exposed to different points of view . In fact , this is what the internet is at its best " a diverse melting pot in which people from all walks of life express their ideas . <p> Its beneficial to have people collaborate with each other in pursuit of a common goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ashamed for not having completed their education , adults can offer their unique experience to the younger students . At the same time , the younger students can share their perspectives with adults , which will undoubtedly inform adults and make them think about the world differently . A diverse social environment enriches everyone and makes a compelling case for adult education <p> This speaks to a broader philosophical shift that prioritizes learning for its own sake , as opposed to learning for the purposes of putting degrees on a resume and getting a good paying job . TheKhan Academy is a perfect example of a free online learning center that is open to anyone who wants to participate . The participants do n't  earn any kind of measurable credit , they just learn new information . <p> To make the most out of digital education , teachers can download LiveTiles Mosaic to customize a state-of-the-art digital classroom . These digital classrooms integrate collaborative apps into a 21st century education experience , as the screen shot below demonstrates . Mosaic can be used for blended learning environments that implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as for distance learning environments that abandon the classroom space all together . <p> As a society , we 've decided that being smart matters and an education does n't  stop . Learning a lifelong process . Thanks to digital technology , adult education is the new normal . 
@@109788990 @5188990/ <h> Category : Uncategorised <p> SharePoint provides a plethora of applications that simplify workplace productivity . Among the most utilized of these applications are the softwares search forms . Search capabilities in SharePoint are very much advanced in that they provide analytics for the documents that staff members access , which is extremely helpful when SharePoint is used to store necessary employee paperwork and other relevant information . <p> Search forms can cover many moving parts in an organization , across all departments . However , we will focus on 10 major forms for SharePoint that businesses frequently use . <p> 1. - Marketing <p> You can store marketing collateral like branding , logos , messaging and possibly go-to-market roadmaps in easily-searchable forms on SharePoint . You can also potentially find statistics , including - - - product growth cycles , metrics and possible forecasts for future marketing initiatives . Depending on how you store the information , you can allow staff members to update the forms as they implement marketing campaigns . <p> 2 . Human Resources <p> By easily searching and accessing forms in SharePoint , staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts . SharePoint can also be used to store forms for requesting vacation or other time off , to minimize the amount of time HR staff has to send these forms to each individual employee . <p> 3 . Feedback <p> Organizations need to hear ideas and/or suggestions from all workers within the establishment to provide more insight into workplace initiatives . Storing feedback forms on SharePoint so they are easily searchable and accessible allows the process of obtaining feedback from your employees easy ! <p> 4 . Expense Forms <p> Depending on your business process , you can use SharePoint to store expense forms and requests for reimbursement for easy employee access , and if this form is frequently used you can have a direct link on your SharePoint homepage to it for ease of use . <p> 5 . Products/Services <p> If your business is retail-oriented , a useful piece of information to store in the easily-searchable SharePoint could be a comprehensive list of products and services , with accompanying price ranges . For example , a dish detergent company will have a list of all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 6 . Finance <p> You can create a form containing all accounting and finance records , and allow access to individuals in the finance and other relevant departments so they can update the information and track financial information . <p> 7 . Design &amp; Development <p> Developers or IT staff can store coding information as they craft it so that their team members can work using this information and create more effective and timely backend solutions . <p> 8 . Sales <p> Though this often coincides with marketing forms , a sales form may contain other important information . These can include for example , selling methods , quotes , pricing , NDA agreements , etc . <p> 9 . Customer Engagement <p> This form is used for design concepts to efficiently target consumers , handle trial requests and also consists of demos . <p> 10 .

This is no secret . The most successful companies today use social media to reach consumers , data visualization software to collect information and mobile devices to collaborate with colleagues . Not since the industrial revolution have business practices changed so profoundly in such a short amount of time . <p> However , the key to digital technology integration is cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness . A company can experiment with all of the latest devices and apps in the world , but if the costs of deployment and maintenance far outweigh the benefits , and if the difficulties of using the technology are more prevalent than any short-term or long-term benefits , it will be a futile endeavor . <p> Jean-luc Ahlers , Director of Software Development at CBM Technology , stresses the importance of timeliness , especially for companies that want to compete in todays increasingly fast-paced workplace environment . Any technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time is worth the investment , Ahlers believes . <p> This is especially true when it comes to developing your companys intranet . Meant to be a collaborative space for employees to conduct business , intranets can sometimes be complicated to use . For example , every company knows that Microsoft SharePoint has its limitations . According to a 2014 user study , 67% of SharePoint users found the experience unfavorable . Its widespread use notwithstanding , companies are not fully sold on SharePoint 's functionalities . <p> CBM Technology has spent 40 years providing innovative IT services , and it knows that instead of taking months to get an intranet up and running with traditional SharePoint , a company can use LiveTiles to speed up the process . An average organization of 90,000 employees across 200,000 SharePoint sites would see a cost saving of 80% with LiveTiles . This cost amounts to over $8 million in the first year with expectations that it will grow over time . In addition , there is an 80 % time saving when it comes to the deployment and maintenance of SharePoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intranet is expensive to deploy and maintain . Ahlers describes one company that spent 3 years and about $100,000 in development costs to implement a customized intranet . This story is not atypical . Many companies want to create user-friendly intranets for their employees , but SharePoints complex , often confusing information architecture causes them to stall . <p> Ahlers explains that when another company used LiveTiles , the companys intranet went from concept to live in under 2 months with a total development cost of $9,000 . This is a massive savings that allows companies to use their resources for more productive activities related to growing their revenue . <p> A digital workplace created with LiveTiles <p> CBM Technology and LiveTiles believe that companies shouldnt have to spend countless hours and dollars on technology integration , which is why we enjoy a fruitful partnership . By following Ahlers advice , companies can use no-code digital solutions like LiveTiles to save time and money on SharePoint development and enhance the user experience of employees
