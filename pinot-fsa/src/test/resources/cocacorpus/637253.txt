Skiing is still possible into April , but the snow melts as May arrives , bringing fast flowing rivers and a variety of birdlife , best spotted in Denali National Park , Glacier Bay and the Kenai Fjords .

The day-to-day weather varies considerably depending on elevation , but in general the best time to travel is between October and May , when it 's warm and dry .

It is the peak travel period though , so you wo n't have the temples to yourself , although November and December offer a little more peace .

Most of our friends were curious ; it 's not the obvious romantic destination after all . But anyone who knows my husband and me and our world-wandering ways ca n't have been too surprised that we went a little off-piste for this , the most significant of trips . We did once holiday in Brunei after all . <p> If like us , you too choose to take a romantic break in India , you 'll soon find it full of beautiful , dream-like spots and wonderfully atmospheric accommodation . And you do n't have to forgo that idyllic beach honeymoon completely . So , to set your heart a-fluttering , here are my favourite romantic things to do in India : <h> The Taj Mahal <p> The ultimate monument to love , the Taj Mahal is exquisite . This glorious structure was commissioned by Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife , Mumtaz Mahal , who died in childbirth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly from marble and semi-precious stones . I challenge you to find a more beautiful building , one more delicate in its detail and shape or more romantic in its setting . Right by the Yamuna River , the jewel-encrusted fa+ade reflects perfectly in the still waters , offering many a picture opportunity from the rose-filled gardens on the other side . Remarkably , the Taj 's white marble changes colour as the sun rises and falls ; come at sunrise for soft pinks and purples , or sunset for glowing orange . It 's every bit as spectacular as you imagine . <p> A boat trip on Lake Pichola <p> The self-proclaimed most romantic city in India , Udaipur is where many Indians go to honeymoon . Here the tranquil Lake Pichola shimmers in the sunlight , overlooked by the 900-metre-long City Palace with its sumptuous mosaics and stained-glass windows . For star-crossed lovers , nothing beats a sunset cruise on the lake , with its fabulous views of the palace and the hills beyond . Be sure to stop off at the landmark Taj Lake Palace , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , the perfect spot for a refreshing sundowner . <h> Look for wild tigers <p> Safari always has had an air of romance about it , and you do n't have to head to Africa to find it . The deep forests of India 's Ranthambore National Park are home to the most regal of the big cats , the Bengal tiger , and make for a great wildlife-watching adventure . If you are not lucky enough to glimpse this elusive creature , fear not , because leopards , jaguars , jungle cats , crocodiles , antelope and a wide variety of birds can also be spotted . On our visit we climbed to the top of Ranthambore Fort where , on the spur of the moment , we had our marriage blessed in a small Hindu temple . The pujari , or priest , tied red and yellow kalavas ( string ) around our wrists , which neither of us removed until they fell of naturally , almost a year later . <p> Goa 's beaches <p> For those in search of the classic beach honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Dip your toes in the softly lapping waves , feel the fine sand under your feet , and kick back under a coconut palm . With 43 miles of almost unbroken coastline , there are plenty of cocktail-sipping spots to choose from , while the town 's crumbling colonial architecture gives the place a soft , olde-worlde charm . <h> Sail the backwaters of Kerala <p> Kerala 's tranquil backwaters are a picturesque water world of nearly 950 miles of canals , 38 rivers and five lakes fringed by lush palms . Your best bet is to slow down the pace and explore the waterways by traditional houseboat , allowing you to soak up the watery scenery . You 'll sail past local villages , coconut trees , tea shops , rice paddies and temples , and watch the sunset over the water , perhaps with a glass of bubbly or two . <p> Camp out in the desert <p> Believe it or not , India is home to the world 's seventh largest desert , the Thar Desert , encompassing 92,200 square miles of sand dunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Jaisalmer , the Thar Desert offers such romantic exploits as sleeping out under the stars , allowing you to take in the raw beauty of nature . You 'll ride a camel into camp , watch the sun sink below the sand , then sit around the campfire and recount the day 's adventures as a dazzling display of stars appears above you . If you 're not into camping , you can opt for some truly luxurious camps instead . Try The Serai by Relais &amp; Ch+teaux : with its air-conditioned tents , double beds , plunge pools and spa , it 's like a five-star hotel in the desert . <p> Breakfast at Wildflower Hall <h> Shimla <p> We stayed in Shimla for the last few nights of our honeymoon and what a place it is . In complete contrast to the deserts and temples of Rajasthan , Shimla is found at the foothills of the Himalayas , and offers panoramic views of the snow-capped Himalayan peaks surrounding it . The town is particularly romantic between November and March when it 's sprinkled with snow , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Therefore it 's very difficult to summarise its climate succinctly or indeed to choose the best time to travel : it will always be high or low season somewhere . So , to help you choose the best time to travel for your interests , we 've split the year into four seasons : <p> Spring <p> April " May <p> Spring is a lovely time to visit China . The flowers are blooming , and days are warm and sunny without being too hot . Temperatures hover around the low 20s , and visitor numbers have not yet reached their summer peak . Rains creep across the southern mountains , bringing wonderfully scenic mists to the Li River and Yellow Mountains . Avoid travelling during May Day week , when the mass migration of domestic travellers can make transport difficult and hotel prices soar . <p> Go for : <p> Sisters ' Meal Festival : In mid-April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and spring with singing , dancing , and elaborate and beautiful ethnic costumes . <p> Water-Splashing Festival : This annual Dai festival involves three days of spraying and being splashed with water .

The south is very sticky , and typhoons can occur here . Summer is the busiest time for domestic tourists , as locals head off on their summer holidays .

During this time the summer rains have stopped and cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are at their sunny best . The domestic summer crowds have gone back to work too , making this the ideal time to hit the tourist hotspots such as the Terracotta Warriors and Chengdu 's panda sanctuary , with autumn colours bringing additional delights to the landscape . <p> Go for : <p> Longji Rice Terraces : the stepped hills of Longji are at their glorious best in autumn , when they turn various shades of gold and look especially resplendent at sunrise . <p> Mid-Autumn Festival : In late September or early October , join the locals to celebrate the annual harvest with lanterns , lights , mooncakes and incense-burning across the country . <p> Winter <p> November " March <p> With temperatures plummeting well below freezing , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China can be bitterly cold .

When not chilling by the sea , wander around town and check out the architecture , a throwback to Goa 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings that this town inherited from the Portuguese " locals also enjoy the daily siesta , so why not join them ? <h> Cruise Kerala 's backwaters <p> Forget 50 Shades of Grey , it 's more 50 shades of green in Kerala , where the emerald palm leaves , grasses , rice paddies and coconut trees merge together to create a lush landscape , made all the lovelier by the watery network of gentle rivers and tributaries running through it . The best way to explore is by houseboat ; you 'll sail leisurely along the waterways while tucking into fried river fish and freshly squeezed coconut juice . Better yet , stay overnight and fall asleep to the sound of lapping waves . <h> Look for elephants in Periyar National Park <p> Deep in the heart of Kerala 's Periyar National Park , the Periyar River teems with wildlife , making it a great spot for a relaxing safari . Your best bet is to take a boat trip along its winding waterways , keeping a look out for deer , bison and birdlife among the pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India 's largest tiger populations , you 're not all that likely to see one . Instead , set your heart on spotting an Indian elephant ; they like to play on the water 's edge , squirting water at themselves and each other to keep cool . <h> Tour the temples of Mahabalipuram <p> In Mahabalipuram , also known as Mamallapuram , stands a collection of 7th-century temples . Most of these impressive monuments are carved straight into the rock , but the oldest structure is the free-standing Shore Temple , built in 700-728AD , which has been eroded over the years by the wind and sea " and even a cyclone at one point " giving it a crumbling , mysterious atmosphere that would n't be too out of place in an Indiana Jones movie . Another worthwhile stop is the Five Rathas , a cluster of five stone chariots watched over by an enormous elephant . <h> Eat Keralan food in Kochi <p> Talking of food , Kochi , an island city , is renowned for its delicious Keralan cuisine . Being a former spice trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fact which comes through loud and clear on local menus . Coconut , fish and rice are the staples , as well as the aforementioned spices , often served up with warm parotta , the local bread . Try the various fish curries " fish molly ( with coconut milk ) or fish peera ( with tamarind and coconut ) are seriously tasty , and look out for curry with banana too . <h> Sail to Mumbai 's Elephanta Island <p> Most visitors to southern India will pass through Mumbai at some point , but did you know that it 's actually an island , connected to the mainland by a series of bridges ? Even further out to sea , and accessed by boat from the city , is Elephanta Island , a complex of rock-hewn temples built in the 6th century . You 'll need a bit of stamina to reach the main temple , 100 steps up the hillside , but it 's worth the slog for the huge reliefs surrounding the chapel at the top . <h> Shop for saris in Chettinad <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chettinad , famous for its beautiful handmade saris , known locally as a kandangis . Woven on a loom using a variety of eye-catching colours , with a bias towards fuchsia pinks and vivid greens , the saris come in a range of intricate patterns , often involving checks and stripes . If you plan on wearing your sari , it 's a good idea to ask for a demonstration of how to tie it , which is an art form in itself . <h> Drink tea in Munnar <p> Among the tea plantations in south India 's largest tea-growing region , Munnar is the ideal spot for a cuppa . With hills varying in altitude from 1,500 to 2,695m , it 's no wonder the British developed it as a hill station , attracted to its cool breezes and verdant greenery . It 's a peaceful place , with mountain streams , winding walking trails and a pretty church , but the main attraction is sampling a cup or two of freshly-brewed loose leaf tea and learning more about the tea-making process . <h> Admire Madurai 's gopurams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's oldest cities , giving it a rich history and fascinating treasure trove of architecture . Its most famous sight is the glorious Sree Meenakshi Temple , whose 12 towering gopurams ( ornate , monumental towers ) protrude high above the treetops and are recognisable for miles around , each one intricately carved with figures from Hindu mythology painted in vivid colours . The temple is so vast it 's almost a town in its own right , and it 's filled with sculptures and shrines dotted among the markets . <p> Explore India 's sensational south with Round the World Experts ' Tranquil Kerala holiday , or call us for a tailor-made quote .

But make the effort to reach this offbeat country and you 'll be rewarded with vast wildernesses , diverse wildlife and some thrilling adventure sports that give New Zealand a run for its money . To start you off , here are seven of our favourite things to do in Zambia : <h> Victoria Falls <p> Known in the local language as Mosi-oa-Tunya , or the Smoke that Thunders ' , Victoria Falls is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World . You 're spoilt for choice of how to see this raging torrent : bungee it , zip-line it , walk it , fly over it , raft it or simply look at it . Come in low season to jump into the Devil 's Pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night during a full moon to see the fabled lunar rainbow . However you see this mighty waterfall , it 's a truly awesome sight . <h> Kafue National Park <p> Stretching for 8,649 square miles , Kafue National Park is larger than Wales , and even richer in flora and fauna . Lions and leopards prowl the forests in search of the various antelope , zebra and wildebeest , while hippos , crocodiles and elephants are often seen by the river banks . Luckily , being less well known than Zambia 's South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi national parks , Kafue receives relatively few visitors , so you feel like you have the animals to yourself . Get up early and hop in a Jeep or take a boat trip on the Kafue River for your best chances of spotting the game . <h> Walking safaris <p> For a more in-depth look at Zambia 's wildlife , try a walking safari in South Luangwa National Park . The guides here are some of the continent 's most knowledgeable , and joining one for an intimate look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rewarding ways to see the bush . On foot you 'll pay more attention to the smaller things such as footprints and droppings , and you might have a close encounter with some of the larger animals as well . <h> Raft the Zambezi <p> Between July and February , lower water levels on the Zambezi River create the ideal conditions for white water rafting . Not for the fainthearted , this is one of the world 's best rafting spots , so fasten your seatbelt for a thrilling ride down Class 5 rapids with fear-inducing names like The Washing Machine , Terminator I and II and Oblivion . Rafting trips usually take a full day and include lunch . Come prepared to get very wet ; flipping rafts are not uncommon . <h> Kasanka National Park <p> If you time it right , you can watch one of nature 's most fascinating spectacles in Kasanka National Park . Every October , straw-coloured fruit bats start arriving in search of ripening palm fruit and flowers , reaching numbers of around eight million by mid-November .

Located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe , Livingstone combines the Edwardian architecture of a former British colonial city with the laid-back charm of a quiet South African town . Its proximity to Victoria Falls makes it a popular spot for thrill-seekers , while those looking for a quieter stay can shop for handmade wares and sample local flavours in town . For a more sedate activity dine onboard the Royal Livingstone Express as it travels across the famous Victoria Falls Bridge or don your finery and take afternoon tea at the rather swanky Royal Livingstone Hotel . <p> Head to Livingstone and with one of Round the World Experts ' Zambia Holidays .

And with no less than 27 national parks and countless other reserves , forests and wetlands , you wo n't be short on walking adventures . Here are seven of the best trail-laden regions to tread : <h> 1 . Santa Rosa National Park <p> Costa Rica 's first national park , established in 1972 , Santa Rosa is Central America 's largest remaining area of dry tropical forest . Its collection of diverse habitats " including mangrove swamps , woodlands and savannahs " provide homes for jaguars , ocelots , howler monkeys , vampire bats and over 250 species of avifauna .

Cerro Chato <p> A dormant volcano that flanks the more well-known and active Arenal Volcano in the Alajuela province , hiking to the top of 1,140m Cerro Chato is n't a walk in the park but then again , the most rewarding ones never are . Start from the Arenal Observatory Lodge and you 'll rub shoulders with sloth , monkeys and iguanas on your steep climb through dense rainforest from the volcano 's base . Once at the top , catch your breath by admiring Chato 's milky emerald crater lake and even though it 's tempting , it 's advised not to take a dip because of its concoction of minerals .

At nine miles long and 3,000m high , it 's a tough trek , but a number of mountain huts provide welcome respite for anyone looking to stay the night . The trek through its namesake national park is just as rewarding as reaching the summit . Flanked by 50m-high oak trees , its one of Costa Rica 's wilder parks so you 'll have more chance of seeing its many inhabitants , such as peccary , pumas , woodpeckers and spider monkeys . <h> 6 .

Manuel Antonio National Park <p> Often named as one of the most beautiful national parks in the world , Manuel Antonio combines white sand beaches with lush rainforest along the Pacific coastline . It 's Costa Rica 's most popular park and small in stature , but do n't let that put you off : its maze of short and simple trails will lead you to fantasy-feel waterfalls ( find a great gem along the Sendero la Catarata trail ) and is home to both two and three-toed sloths hiding amid the guarumo trees .

Glacier-fed , this high-altitude pool is a lake of postcard perfection , the water a milky , turquoise blue , fringed by crimson-striped rocks and a carpet of emerald forest . <p> Descend to Saskatchewan Crossing before entering the Icefields " unsurprisingly the best part .

If you 've got a head for heights , do n't miss the dizzying Glacier Skywalk either : a new glass-bottomed lookout that hangs over a cliff edge , with nothing but a 280-metre drop beneath your feet . <p> For one last photo op before reaching Jasper National Park , make a stop at the severely underrated Tangle Creek Falls .

Room-only rates start from -113pn . <p> As for petrol , make sure you top up your tank in advance .

You wo n't regret it - although you may feel the slight pang of panic and remorse if you hit the road without fully preparing for the journey ahead . Rest assured though , we 're here to give you a brief lesson on the dos and don'ts of driving holidays in Australia , so you can get behind the wheel and enjoy the ride . <h> Do familiarise yourself with local signs <p> While most Australian road signs are either similar to those in the UK or self-explanatory , some may seem a little different . To prepare yourself before getting behind the wheel , we recommend taking a look at the Government website for the state you are driving in . This is an example of the signs you 'll need to know when driving in Queensland . <h> Do n't miss the tourist drive signs <p> If you 're looking to take the scenic route , most popular tourist areas will have signs directing you along the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map , turn the GPS off and enjoy the drive . <h> Do take a break every few hours <p> Australia is a big country . When it comes to seeing the country by road , a rookie mistake is to bite off more that you can chew . For example , most locals see driving from Brisbane to Sydney as a big journey " averaging 10 hours with no breaks . While you 're on holiday , only drive a few hours each day so you can truly enjoy yourself . There 's no fun in rushing to the next town before dark . When you do need a break , most highways have regular rest areas along the way . <h> Do n't assume all highways have the same speed limit <p> Most highways in Australia have a 100 kilometres ( 62 miles ) per hour speed limit . The two exceptions to this rule are Western Australia and Northern Territory , which have a 110 kilometres ( 68 miles ) per hour speed limit . When in doubt , do n't exceed 100 kilometres per hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught over the speed limit , you will be presented with a hefty fine . <h> Do wear sunscreen " even in the car <p> It 's a common occurrence to sport a tanned right arm in Australia , just from having it close to the window when driving . To keep an even tan , we recommend wearing sunscreen at all times , even when in the car . <h> Do n't go off road unless you are well prepared <p> If you plan on driving in the outback or along sand dunes , you 're going to need more than just a 4X4 . Driving in these environments can be tricky , with many travellers getting lost , overheating their car , or more commonly , getting bogged . To play it safe , we recommend letting an expert tour company take the wheel for you , or at the very least driving with a group . <h> Do keep a look out for wildlife ( especially at dawn and dusk ) <p> One of the best parts about visiting Australia may be seeing the country 's cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on where you are driving , it 's not uncommon to see road signs warning about kangaroos , koalas , emus and even echidnas being near roads .

With some kangaroos weighing up to 14 stone , hitting a roo ' can often be just as dangerous for you and your passengers , as well as the animal . <h> Do n't ignore bush fire warnings <p> Bush fires can be quite common in Australia , particularly in rural parts of Victoria and New South Wales in summer . In some cases , fires can be controlled burns designed to rid the land of fuel , while others can be uncontrolled fires . Before driving , always check the road 's conditions for bush fire warnings .

Away from the bars of Bangkok , Thailand is a country steeped in ancient traditions and a dominant ideology ; centred around religious beliefs , patriotism and a societal hierarchy . <p> As a teacher living in Thailand , Sandy Dhaliwal has mastered the general etiquette and traditions underpinned by Thailand 's Buddhist beliefs . Read on to make sure that you avoid a social faux pas on your trip to Thailand . <h> Head and feet <p> In Thailand , your head is seen as the holiest and most honourable part of your body , as it carries your soul . Your feet , on the other hand , are the lowest and therefore the unholiest . Because of this belief , it is considered extremely impolite to touch someone 's head , especially if said person is older than you . <p> Thailand is a delight for the Podophobia 's among us . When it comes to feet , avoid touching people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In temples , try to point your feet away from any images of a Buddha so as not to cause any offense . Additionally , you must not put your feet on money , as the king 's image is on the currency . So if you drop it and it blows in the breeze either try and catch it with your hands or just accept your loss . <h> Temples <p> It 's not uncommon to see food and drink offerings outside shrines , but try to leave it alone . Thais are very superstitious , and if you start helping yourself to the free sample 's ' you could be disturbed by spiritual forces . You will also see orange-robed monks roaming the grounds of most temples . Unfortunately , if you 're a woman traveller you must respectfully keep your distance . Monks have to go through a lengthy cleansing process if they come into bodily contact with a woman and that 's just hassle . <h> Greeting people <p> Instead of waving , shaking hands , hugging or even kissing , the Thais have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wai " clasping hands together in the prayer position and bowing or slightly nodding . It is the most common and respectful way to acknowledge another person ; and you can use it to say hello , goodbye and thank you . <p> How you wai depends on who you are actually speaking to . There are three places to position your hands ; determined by whether the person is older or respected , the same age as you or a monk . If you are wai-ing a monk , you should have your hands placed adjacent to your forehead " same goes with an image of Buddha . If you are wai-ing someone older , place your hands adjacent to your nose . Lastly if you are wai-ing someone that is your own age , you place your hands adjacent to your chin . Basically , the higher up your hands , the more respect you are expressing . One thing you do n't have to do though is wai children . But they will more than often wai you as Thailand is all about showing respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fiercely patriotic and love their royal family . So much so that you will hear their national anthem played publicly , twice a day , every day . And out of respect you must stop what you are doing and stand still if you hear it . At 8am and 6pm , if you are in a public place such as at a train station , drop everything as you 'll know the drill ! Additionally , if you go to the cinema in Thailand , you will have to stand for the anthem in there before the film starts . I love the novelty of it all really , it is just so different to back home . <p> Another thing that you must be aware of is that in Thailand , their culture is taught not to question their monarchy or government . This could even lead to a custodial sentence , so save your political views for discussing down the pub when you 're back home . <h> What we find rude , is not rude in Thailand <p> Thais can be preoccupied with appearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in preference you will become or respect you will get . <p> Appearances are often commented on .

Things that would have driven me insane in England just do n't bother me here and as long as you keep an open mind , and respect the local culture you 'll find that these traditions are what make travelling in Thailand great .

Besides from rugging up in warm clothing " Banff can get down to -26-C on a mild ' winter 's day , clipping a pair of snow cleats onto your boots is a life saver . Their purpose is to help you keep traction on snow and ice so you spend more time upright and less time on the ground . Two easy and enjoyable walks , and my personal favourites , are the Johnston Canyon Icewalk and trekking across Lake Louise . The iconic emerald blue lake freezes over in winter , opening up a 4km trek , a round trip that ends at the base of a stunning 100 metre-high frozen waterfall . <p> image : Alexa Gordon <h> Take a ride on a horse sleigh <p> I must confess , ever since Carrie took Big on a romantic ride in a horse drawn carriage in cult hit Sex and the City , I have been slightly obsessed in recreating the much loved moment .

Sitting back and relaxing while magnificent creatures take you through incredible landscapes is a truly memorable experience .

Just keep in mind it is a little bumpy at times and take advantage of the blankets offered by the driver " it can get quite chilly . <p> image : Alexa Gordon <h> Soak in the hot springs <p> It might sound counterintuitive when it is -26-C outside , but bringing your cossie to Banff in the dead of winter is a must . There is something magical about sitting in deliciously hot water , the air around you Arctic-cold , the steam blowing up from the water , the majestic mountains nestled in the backgroundhave I convinced you yet ? Banff Upper Hot Springs is a haven and offers nutrient filled water for sore , tired muscles . Just make sure to avoid peak times otherwise you will find yourself sharing the space with many other travellers .

Cup of hot chocolate in one hand , magazine in the other , the feeling of warmth slowly seeping through your body is divine . Looking out from your cozy spot in front of the fire to the glittery snow falling down outside brings a feeling of sweet content . If you 're anything like me , within 10 minutes of finishing your hot chocolate , you will be snoozing away . <p> image : Alexa Gordon <h> Go on a wildlife safari <p> Bear spotting is almost a sacred right for tourists visiting Canada 's first National Park , and for most a once-in-a-lifetime experience .

The guided tour allows you to get up close and personal with a wide variety of wildlife from the safety and comfort of a heated bus .

The first time I spotted an elk , nudging its nose along the frozen ground in search for food , was a wonderful moment I will not forget in a hurry .

To help you choose , we 've split the year into its two seasons : <p> Dry Season <p> May to October <p> Peru 's dry season is the most popular time to visit . Temperatures hover around the high teens , and bright , sunny days and cooler temperatures in the Andes bring ideal conditions for hiking in the mountains and cruising Lake Titicaca .

Quiet and still , spectators can cruise along the smooth waters and gaze in awe at the mountains that are believed to have first been discovered by the Maori more than 1,000 years ago . <h> Sky gaze at Lake Tekapo <p> Famed for its spring bloom of the pink and purple Russell Lupine flower , Lake Tekapo is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palette is the turquoise lake , which gets its milky blue colour from the fine dust created by the glaciers of the Southern Alps grinding against the rocks .

This now restored castle was founded in 1583 , and re-constructed in 1592 after an invasion from Korea . Unfortunately , this seemingly cursed castle faced further destruction from an earthquake and destroyed again by a fire in 1881 . The remains of the rebuilt castle can be found adjacent to the Kenroku-en Garden .

@@9537587 @2737587/ <h> 5 of the Greatest Train Journeys Worldwide <p> There 's something thoroughly romantic about travelling by train . Before you say it , we 're not talking about the Piccadilly Line from Leicester Square to Covent Garden at the height of the sweltering , humid British summer . We 're talking about those iconic , cross-country rail journeys that everyone ca n't help but add to their bucket list . We love them . The way they rumble and clatter across the tracks , powering through landscapes that few other modes of transport have even touched , battling extremes of weather and wilderness . <p> Riding the rails is one of the most beloved ways to get around " especially for lovers of overlanding " so it 's only fitting we share our favourites with you . Without further ado , here are five of the greatest train journeys worldwide <p> The Rocky Mountaineer is one of the most legendary train rides in North America , nay , the world . It can thank its renowned Gold Leaf Service for that " a two-tier luxury carriage , best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views above , through a high , glass-domed roof . <p> A flight may get you from Vancouver to Calgary in less than an hour , but the two-day Rocky rides to Jasper ( Journey Through the Clouds ) and Banff ( First Passage to the West ) via Kamloops are undoubtedly the best ways to take in all that breathtaking scenery . An aerial perspective will mostly afford cloud-covered views , interspersed with the jagged peaks of the Rockies ( if you 're fortunate and the weather 's good ) and some ant-sized wildlife . Compare that to this double-decker locomotive where , from the comfort of your seat , you can watch on as the blue and gold behemoth carves a path across desert landscapes , right through the middle of mountains and past big-horn sheep , bald eagles and , if you 're lucky , a grizzly or two . I know which view I 'd prefer . <p> The legendary Ghan runs deep into the heart of Australia , through the wilderness of the Red Centre , for a jaw-dropping 1,861 miles from Adelaide to Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire epic desert crossing and you 'll spend two days and three nights on board , wowed by the burnt orange dust of the vast desert landscapes and crimson-hued canyons by day , and lulled to sleep by the gentle chugging of the train at night . <p> Stop off at Alice Springs ( or Alice ' as the locals call it ) for a real taste of the outback . This isolated town has only 27,000 inhabitants and little else surrounding it but red sand . In fact , the closest city is nearly 1,000 miles away " this is as remote as it gets . If you did n't realise quite how big Australia is before you booked , you will after this landmark journey . <p> Okay , so Shinkansen ( or as it 's better-known , the bullet train ) rides are n't strictly journeys , but that does n't make them any less unmissable . For starters , they 're the epitome of Japanese living : sleek , futuristic , clinically clean and punctual " the British rail network could learn a thing or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , whizzing passengers across a 1,500-mile network of six lines at speeds of nearly 200mph . Do n't expect to be knocked over by the g-force , but you can expect to arrive at your destination promptly , having zipped across the Land of the Rising Sun in mere minutes . Even the journey from Tokyo-Kyoto takes just two hours , 20 minutes by bullet . <p> And when you buy a season pass ( from -160 for a week 's unlimited use ) you 'll actually see huge cost benefits " another thing we 've yet to adopt in Old Blighty . <p> The affectionately-monikered Toy Train ( aka the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway ) is the tortoise to the Shinkansen 's super-speedy hare . Travelling at a meagre 7.5mph through the soaring elevations between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling , you 'd be right in thinking you wo n't get anywhere fast but that 's sort of the point . You 'll have plenty of time to take in emerald tea plantations , snow-capped peaks and thick forests that way , not to mention the narrow gauge train feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On the popular Shimla-bound route from Kalka , you 'll pass through a staggering 103 tunnels and over more than 900 bridges as you climb to altitudes in excess of 2,200 metres . It 's like no other train journey on earth . <p> Not many locos can boast hosting presidents and worldwide royalty , so the Blue Train is rare in that respect . It 's easy to see the allure though . This decadent hotel on wheels feels as though it 's trapped in time , decorated with luxurious 19th century era fixtures and furnishings that , combined with magnificent views from Cape Town to Pretoria , provide a memorable experience for all its passengers . <p> Renowned for its opulence , guests benefit from gourmet dining , a butler service , an observation car , soundproofed en-suite compartments and gold-tinted windows .

Whoever finds it in their slice is king for the day and gets to wear a crown . Further afield , Venezuelans celebrate by roller-skating to church , while in Spain , a Christmas log poops out presents .

@@9537593 @2737593/ <h> 10 Must-sees in Malaysia <p> Malaysia is blessed with a heady mixture of wonderfully diverse wildlife , picture-perfect beaches and history-filled towns . So where to start ? Here 's our pick of the top 10 attractions . <h> Malacca <p> The historic port city of Malacca ( also spelled Melaka ) is an intoxicating blend of heritage architecture , diverse fusion cuisine and a vibrant waterfront . Chinese traders have strongly influenced the history , culture and food of Malacca , and where better to witness this than buzzing Jonker Street , lined with countless museums , souvenir shops and restaurants serving the sweet yet spicy Nyonya cuisine ? <h> Petronas Towers <p> The Petronas Towers were the tallest buildings in the world from 1998 to 2004 , and are a much-recognised symbol of Kuala Lumpur . Ride the lift up these twin skyscrapers and see the city stretching into the distance , a sight that 's particularly impressive when lit up at night . For the best views , choose from the Skybridge on the 41st floor , which forms a bridge between the two towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although you can always do both of course . <h> Mount Kinabalu <p> The 4,095m peak of Mount Kinabalu towers majestically above the rainforest canopy of Mount Kinabalu National Park . The forest is filled with animal and plant life , including over 800 orchid species and the insect-munching pitcher plant . You can choose to simply explore the park and admire Kinabalu 's peak from afar , or grab your hiking boots and climb to the summit , a two-day trek requiring a reasonable level of fitness , but no prior experience . <h> Orangutans <p> To see Malaysian Borneo 's most famous resident , the old man of the forest ' , known to you and me as the orangutan , is a real treat . Despite these magnificent creatures being endangered , it 's not too difficult to spot one : head to Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah for your best chance , and observe the orangutans as they are taught the skills needed to be introduced back into the wild . Orangutans are also sometimes sighted along the Kinabatangan River ( see below ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a magical experience to see these sociable apes interacting , so do n't forget your camera . <p> Image : Angela Griffin <h> Cameron Highlands <p> Think of the Cameron Highlands and no doubt emerald green tea plantations , rolling hills and misty peaks will spring to mind . A visit to a tea plantation is a must-do " a personal favourite of mine is the Boh Tea Estate where you can sip on different brews and feast on home-baked scones stuffed with clotted cream and plenty of jam . For a more energetic approach , pull on your hiking boots and take a walk through the hills , admiring the gorgeous views . <h> George Town <p> The capital of the state of Penang , Georgetown ( George Town ) is a World Heritage site filled with crumbling mansions and atmospheric shophouses , where the sounds of the prayer calls emanate from the mosques and the waft of incense from Chinese temples hangs in the air . The main activity here is eating ; tuck in to Chinese-style char kway teow ( noodles with soy sauce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup with coconut milk ) in the hawker stalls or restaurants for an authentic taste of Malaysia . <h> Kinabatangan River <p> Malaysia 's second longest river , the 347-mile Kinabatangan , is all about the wildlife . Take a boat ride through the mangrove swamps or trek to the oxbow lakes to spot crocodiles , macaques , orangutans and proboscis monkeys . There are plenty of birds too , such as hornbills and kingfishers . If you are really lucky , you might even spot wild elephants . <h> Batu Caves <p> Just outside Kuala Lumpur , and easy to visit on a day trip , the Batu Caves were discovered in 1878 and today are used as temples by Hindu priests . To go inside the vast caverns you 'll need to ascend a muscle-aching 272 steps , past an enormous gold statue of Lord Murugan who stands guard at the entrance . The impressive interior is filled with shrines , monuments and a troop of cheeky monkeys who are out to steal your lunch . <h> Snorkelling and diving <p> The seas around Malaysia are wonderfully warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nearly 3,000 miles of coastline , there are plenty of pretty beaches and islands to choose from . Langkawi is perhaps the most famous of the islands , dotted with upmarket hotels and blessed with clear seas . Or , if you 've just climbed Mount Kinabalu , perhaps try Manukan Island , within the Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine National Park , where you 'll find many multi-coloured fish just 20 minutes by boat from Kota Kinabalu . Alternatively , try the remote Gaya Island , accessible only by boat and surrounded by coral reefs and mangroves . <h> Food <p> Malaysia 's population is made up of Malays , Chinese and Indians , creating a wonderfully diverse fusion cuisine unlike anything else in Southeast Asia . Start your tasting menu with a plate of murtabak ( pictured ) , a delicious unleavened bread ( known as roti canai ) stuffed with spiced curry . Another favourite of mine is mee goreng , a fried noodle dish with garlic , onions and prawns or chicken . And do try a dosa " a huge very thin pancake that you dip in curry sauce or gravy .

@@9537612 @2737612/ <h> 10 Things to Do in Christchurch , New Zealand <p> The largest city in New Zealand 's South Island , and a popular arrival point for those flying in from Australia or Asia , Christchurch is a lovely , peaceful city . More than a little reminiscent of a quaint English town , albeit one with a few tower blocks around , the city 's vibrancy and remarkable recovery after the devastating earthquake of 2011 have shot it straight into Lonely Planet 's Best In Travel lists . If you 've been pre-earthquake , you 'll remember a laid-back , attractive place with plenty going on ; go post-earthquake and you 'll find an optimistic , fun-filled city bouncing back after one of the worst periods in its history . Here are 10 of our favourite things to do here : <p> The TranzAlpine Train runs daily from Christchurch to Greymouth , a 139-mile journey that crosses the Canterbury Plains and winds between the towering peaks of the Southern Alps . It 's a beautiful route , with spectacular scenery at every turn , and in our opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train journeys . It 's possible to do the round trip in one ( rather long ) day , departing at 08:15 and returning at 18:31 , or you could travel one-way and pick up your hire car in Greymouth , home to the intriguing Punakaiki Pancake Rocks , to continue exploring the South Island . <p> Have a picnic in Hagley Park <p> The largest urban open space in New Zealand , Hagley Park has added a touch of green to Christchurch since 1855 . Its lawns and paths are perfect for a picnic , although there are plenty of nearby cafes to try if you do n't want to bring your own lunch . Come in spring for the blooming flowers , summer for various concerts and arts events , autumn for the gorgeous foliage colours and winter for twinkling white snowscapes , or if you fancy building a snowman . <p> Learn more about Maori history at the Canterbury Museum <p> The Canterbury Museum , established in 1867 , tells the story of Christchurch and Canterbury from prehistoric times to present day , with exhibits including nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the Egyptian mummy and the dinosaur skeletons , but learning more about the Maori people , including the excellent examples of Maori art and pounamu ( greenstone ) jewellery , are the stand-out highlights . <h> Go punting on the Avon <p> Punting on Christchurch 's Avon River is one of the city 's most relaxing pastimes , and is especially enjoyable if you have a bright , sunny day to play with and are in no hurry whatsoever . With the help of a guide , you 'll glide past the Botanic Gardens and various historic city centre buildings as you take in the leafy riverbanks and overhanging willow trees . Punting is possible all year round , even in winter , when blankets and hot water bottles are provided to ensure you are extra cosy . <h> Pay your respects at the Earthquake Memorial <p> On 22nd February 2011 , a 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch , six miles southeast of the city centre . The tremor brought down Christchurch 's Cathedral , which had stood since 1904 , as well as many other city buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 185 empty chairs , one for each of those who died that day , has been erected on the site of the former St Paul 's Trinity Pacific Presbyterian Church , which was also destroyed . Although not your usual tourist attraction , it 's a quiet place for peaceful reflection . <h> Check out the Cardboard Cathedral <p> When Christchurch 's beloved cathedral was damaged in the 2011 earthquake , city dwellers were left without their main place of worship . So as a temporary fix , the Cardboard Cathedral was built out of , yup , you guessed it , cardboard . Designed by architect Shigeru Ban , the A-framed structure incorporates 86 cardboard tubes rising 21 metres skyward and connected by a triangular mosaic of stained glass . The effect is impressive , and well worth a look , even if cathedrals are n't usually your bag . <p> Shop in the Re:START mall <p> Another symbol of Christchurch 's recovery from the 2011 earthquake , Re:START was built to replace the mostly destroyed City Mall , much of which was later demolished . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution , but such is its popularity that it still stands over five years later . The shops here are located in brightly-painted shipping containers and include quirky gift shops , cosy cafes and funky boutiques " well worth a browse even if you 're not buying anything . <p> Experience a snowstorm at the International Antarctic Centre <p> Out by Christchurch International Airport , making it a good pre-flight option , the International Antarctic Centre is very popular city attraction , in no small part due to its adorable family of little blue penguins . Home to the New Zealand Antarctic Programme , the centre allows non-polar explorers a glimpse of life at the South Pole , and includes a chilly recreation of an Antarctic snowstorm , plus the opportunity to ride in a Hagglund , a type of all-terrain vehicle .

To mark the occasion you 'll find events and ceremonies happening at zoos and elephant parks up and down the country , with the animals being treated to banquets of fruit and sugar canes , while Buddhist ceremonies take place with the hope of bringing luck to both the animals and their mahouts ( handlers ) . <p> When : 13th March <p> Where : Zoos and elephant parks nationwide <p> Muay Thai <h> National Muay Thai Day <p> Muay Thai is an exciting martial art that hails from the Land of Smiles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely worth the trip , especially if you 're a fan of combat sports .

Visit here to enjoy week-long festivities , including displays , blessings and of course , matches . <h> Songkran ( Thai New Year ) <p> Who does n't love a water fight in the summer ? Well , how about a festival dedicated to your favourite childhood past time ? New Year in many Southeast Asian countries , including Thailand , is celebrated with lively street parties and a whole lot of enthusiastic water splashing .

As a people , they are deeper superstitious and have a strong belief in the paranormal " my students particularly loved me telling them ghost stories " and they believe that throughout the month , the veils separating Earth and the afterlife are lowered , allowing spirits to roam the living world . These ghosts are thought to be searching for food and entertainment , so in turn will be left offerings during special ceremonies at temples and shrines .

However , the land that was home to a ruthless regime and a protracted civil war well into the 1990s has finally started to attract tourists to its amazing sites . <p> With nearly 3 million foreign tourists in 2012 , Cambodia is quickly changing from a forgotten third world country to an exciting travel destination . <p> However , before you go , there are a few things you should know before visiting Cambodia . <h> More to see than Angkor Wat <p> There 's no denying that Angkor Wat is one of the world 's most amazing sites , and its popularity is quickly increasing . However , if you think Angkor Wat is the only temple worth seeing , you 're in for a surprise . <p> First off , Angkor Wat is just one of the many temple complexes that comprise the Angkor Historical Site . Have you ever watched a movie where they show a giant stone face ? It 's taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with giant faces . Or what about a temple with a tree growing through it ? That 's the insanely beautiful Ta Prohm ( which was featured in the movie Tomb Raider ) . <p> Further afield , you can get away from the tourists and the heavy restoration by visiting beautiful temples like Beng Mealea , Koh Ker and Preah Vihear . <h> See the Irrawaddy Dolphins <p> A rather unexpected creature lurks in the waters of the Mekong River in northern Cambodia : dolphins . While we normally think of dolphins as ocean animals , the Mekong River is home to one of the last remnants of Irrawaddy river dolphins in the world , a critically endangered species . <p> While Irrawaddy dolphins may not jump like their oceanic cousins , watching them breaking the water all around you is a beautiful sight . <p> What just a few decades ago was a thriving population of thousands has now been reduced to less than 100 , most living in a stretch of river near the town of Kratie . <p> The local government has set up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats and encourages the local population to save this beautiful species . <p> While Irrawaddy dolphins may not jump like their oceanic cousins , watching them breaking the water all around you is a beautiful sight . Where else can you see such a great concentration of a critically endangered animal ? <h> Cambodia might have your dream island <p> When travellers come to Southeast Asia , many dream of relaxing on a secluded island . Unfortunately , though , this dream is becoming less and less of a reality as development changes many islands from peaceful sanctuaries to tourist meccas . <p> However , thanks to significantly lower tourism numbers , Cambodia is home to several islands that can offer you the escape you dream about . <p> For those looking for a Robinson Crusoe-type island , but with a touch of civilization , head to Koh Tonsay , also known as Rabbit Island . Located a short boat ride from the town of Kep , Koh Tonsay is the perfect destination for anyone who does n't mind roughing it . While your accommodation might just be a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secluded beach , cheap massages and fantastic food more than make up for it . <h> Cambodia uses US dollars <p> Yes , Cambodia does have its own currency , the Riel , but for day to day use , the US dollar rules the roost . Commonly fixed at 4,000 to 1 against the Riel , you 'll have to get used to thinking in two different currencies during your time in Cambodia . If the price is listed as $1.50 , and you pay with $2 , you 'll get 2,000 Riel back as change ( of course , you could also pay with $1 and 2,000 Riel or simply 6,000 Riel ) . <p> Fortunately , getting US dollars is easy , as they are the currency dispensed to foreigners in the local ATM machines . Unfortunately , though , you 're likely to get $50 or $100 bills .

Having heard all about its strong pilgrim history , charming architecture , rugged beaches and fresh lobster rolls , I was eager to get out and about to explore . Here are my top five things to do in this popular holiday region : <p> Clams <h> Gorge on seafood <p> Clams clams clams . Stuffed clams , clam strips , clam chowder . There are clams everywhere . Not only are there clams , there are crabs , scallops , oysters , mussels , lobster rolls and fish galore being sold in abundance and they are DELICIOUS !

The island is quite big but it has custom-made cycle paths which meander around the charming towns and along the coastal roads . <p> You could do a whistle-stop tour in a day , or stay overnight and spend a few lazy days eating lobster rolls . <p> Top Tip : Visit Edgartown and stop off at the Seafood Shanty , a restaurant with cool vibes and a terrace overlooking the marina . <p> House in Cape Cod image : Lucy Tolley <h> Drive Route 6A <p> If you need to get across the cape in a hurry , Route 6 is the road for you .

Turns out : she had n't . It was a revelation that got me rather excited " after all , untouristy spots anywhere in the world are pretty hard to come by these days . <p> Departing the docks on a blissful , blue-sky morning , I could n't imagine a better day to be visiting a secluded isle , fringed by the Great Barrier Reef . We reached paradise in under an hour and while Fitzroy was n't exactly a well-kept secret , it was relatively crowd-free , which is what made it such a heavenly experience . The island is home to a hotel , water sports centre , shop , restaurant , bar , turtle rehabilitation centre and , well , little else .

It did n't give us much time to explore beforehand , but we were keen to combine our tour with a one-hour snorkel on the reef " and this was the slot in which to do it . Under the watchful eye of our guide , we cruised out to the opposite side of the island , grabbed our flippers , masks , snorkels and noodles ( or to non-Aussies : floats ) and plunged into the water . <p> There 's plenty of snorkelling opportunities in the waters around Fitzroy ( Image : Tourism Tropical North Queensland ) <p> The scene beneath us seemed murky at first , but as the sun emerged from behind a cloud suddenly the corals were injected with colour . Marine life darted between rocks and reef , and nearby one of the group called out saying she 'd spotted a small reef shark .

We headed over to Foxy 's " located on the opposite side of the hotel to the water sports centre " where we were treated to a feast of fresh fish ( including some delicious calamari ) , chips and salad . That , washed down with a crisp glass of cider , was exactly what I needed to refuel me for the afternoon . Full and happy , we sat on the decking and took a moment to take in where we were : the floating isle , the crystal-clear skies , the pristine , still waters , only rippled by a light summer breeze It was utter bliss . <h> Do your bit for injured sea turtles <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially as we knew what lay ahead : turtles .

Do n't worry though , there 's still plenty of time to cram in all the good stuff I 've talked already talked about before you depart . There 's also time to expend any excess energy too , with a hike along the Lighthouse Track . <p> The island has plenty of hills to climb and trails to tackle " all offering great views across the reef and surrounding isles " but this one is undoubtedly the most rewarding .

@@9537683 @2737683/ <h> 9 Things to Do in Beijing <p> Featured destinations : Beijing <p> Published 30 March 2017 <p> Angela Griffin <p> Fly into Beijing and you 'll arrive into a teeming pass of people , beeping horns , interweaving bicycles and general craziness . It can be somewhat overwhelming at first , especially if it 's your first time in Asia , but give it time , visit a few of the city 's historic sights , and you 'll soon come to love the freneticism , bright lights and endless chitter chatter . After all , that 's what makes Beijing Beijing . Here are our favourite things to do while you 're in town : <h> Stand in the centre of Tiananmen Square <p> Right next door to the Forbidden City , you 'll find Tiananmen Square , the seventh largest city square in the world . Famous for all the wrong reasons , the square was the site of the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 , and the following day when an unknown man stood in front of a line of tanks in protest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Heroes and the Great Hall of the People , Tiananmen Square is home to the mausoleum of Chairman Mao , who governed China from 1945 until his death in 1976 . If you 're curious , you can view his rather waxy looking embalmed body . <h> Walk on the Great Wall of China <p> If you want to see the Great Wall of China , and quite frankly , you 'd be crazy not to , then you have a few choices to make . Either take short route from Beijing to the wall 's easiest accessible point at Badaling or Juyongguan , popular with day-trippers , or head further afield to Jinshanling , around three hours ' drive from Beijing . Here you take a cable car to the top , soak up the views and then , if you 're feeling up to it , walk along the wall for 6.5 miles to Simatai . There 's some scrambling involved , plenty of steep bits and lots of avoiding the postcard sellers , but it 's worth it for views of the wall and the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine miles from Beijing 's city centre , but worth the effort to reach , the Summer Palace is a delightful spot to while away a sunny ( or not so sunny ) afternoon . Made up of the huge Kunming Lake , pretty landscaped gardens , numerous pavilions and bridges , and a boat made of marble , the Summer Palace complex is best explored at slow place , taking the time to wander the pathways or perhaps hire a pedalo or a dragon boat to explore the lakeshore in more detail . <h> Admire the Temple of Heaven <p> Built in 1420 , the Temple of Heaven is notable for having been constructed without the use of nails . It 's a vast complex , larger than the Forbidden City , with many buildings to explore and plenty of open spaces where you might spot locals singing , dancing or playing musical instruments .

These shows , first performed over 2,000 years ago , are pretty impressive , and very popular for their death-defying feats of balance and skill . Popular acts include balancing on seemingly impossible objects , juggling , martial arts and use of props such as hoops , vases and chairs . The shows are so popular that the best acrobats can even become minor celebrities . Catch it at the Chaoyang Theatre and prepare to be amazed . <h> Smell the incense at the Lama Temple <p> Also known as the Yongehegong Temple , Beijing 's Lama Temple is a wonderfully preserved example of a lamasery .

Follow our top tips and long haul will be a breeze . <p> Prebook your seats <p> Most long haul carriers allow you to prebook your seats .

If time allows , stay up late or sleep in before your flight , and make sure you are well rested . Having said that , do n't try to stay awake to make yourself sleep on the plane ; you 'll just arrive frustrated and panda-eyed , and no one needs that .

Despite what jet-setting celebrities think , this is n't a fashion show and you 'll be far happier in comfy , loose-fitting tracksuit bottoms and soft , worn-in shoes than skyscraper heels and a figure hugging dress . <p> Bring a pillow <p> Unless you 're in business class , sleeping sitting up is unavoidable on a plane , and it usually comes hand in hand with neck ache .

They might not be the cheapest option but bring noise-cancelling headphones and you 'll sleep in blissful silence , whatever 's going on around you . Alternatively , plug yourself into the airline 's entertainment system and drown out the din . <p> Bring a book <p> In this busy world it 's not often we get time to ourselves .

We 're not talking running or weightlifting , but simple circling with your arms and ankles , or a short walk up and down the aisle to get the blood circulating , will help avoid any aches and pains . <p> Do n't stress <p> If you ca n't sleep , do n't stress .

Come to soak up the sun , laze on the beach and watch the sunset , or for the more active , explore the surrounding rivers and islands . Whatever you 're into , there 's plenty to see and do here in the tropics ; here are a few of our favourite things to do in Darwin : <h> Visit the markets <p> Darwin 's Mindil Beach Sunset Markets are some of the most popular markets in the entire state . Their beachside location makes them a massive draw , particularly at sunset , when seemingly the entire population of Darwin shows up with a picnic blanket and a bottle of wine to watch the sun sink below the horizon . The market stands sell all sorts , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open during the dry season from May to October only . <h> Hit the beach <p> Darwin 's location on the edge of the Timor Sea brings warm waters and soft sandy beaches to the region . One of the city 's most popular sunbathing spots is the lovely Casuarina Beach , a vast swathe of white sand popular with dog walkers and sunset watchers . Named after the casuarina trees that grow here , the beach , which includes the sandstone cliffs of the Casuarina Coastal Reserve , is affected by high and low tides , so do check before you visit . <h> Watch for wildlife at Berry Springs Nature Park <p> If you wake up to a bright sunny day and fancy a picnic , then Berry Springs Nature Park is the place to go . Here , crystal clear pools are filled with fish ( bring your goggles or snorkelling mask ) , waterfalls cascade , and there are plenty of easy walks through the forests to try . The park is home to numerous birds , and is located right next door to the crocodiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom at the end of the wet season in March and April . <h> Swim with crocs at Crocosaurus Cove <p> If you 've always wanted to get up close to a giant saltwater crocodile ( and if so , are you crazy ? ! ) then this is the place to do it . At this wildlife park , in the heart of Darwin , brave swimmers are lowered into crocodile infested waters inside a Perspex box , allowing them to get closer to crocodiles than ever before . If that 's a little too extreme , you can also check out the turtles and barramundi , and even cuddle a baby crocodile , although we ca n't vouch for how cuddly they actually are . <h> Cruise the Adelaide River <p> Continuing the crocodile theme , these fearsome creatures lurk in the murky waters of the Adelaide River , about an hour and a quarter 's drive from Darwin . To see them , your best bet is to join a river cruise , many of which feature Jumping Crocs which are tempted out of the water by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity not for the faint-hearted . <h> Sail to the Tiwi Islands <p> Around 60 miles north of Darwin , out in the middle of the ocean , you 'll find the Tiwi Islands , a small cluster of landmasses with a population of just 2,000 people , most of whom are aboriginal . Day trips to the islands by ferry from Darwin are easy to arrange and highly recommended for the insight they give into Tiwi island culture , including the beautiful Tiwi artwork on display . Local artists produce exquisite and pretty distinctive pieces including paintings , pottery , carvings and sculptures , and you can even learn how to create your own piece to take home . <h> Ride the Ghan Train to Adelaide <p> The Ghan Train makes the 1,851 mile journey from Adelaide to Darwin and back twice a week , taking four days and three nights . The ride is a great way to take in the vast emptiness of the Red Centre without the hassle , as it 's easy to arrange with transfers to and from your Darwin hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine dining atmosphere , and watch the red sands and rock formations roll by from the comfort of your private cabin . The train makes stops at Katherine and Alice Springs along the way . <h> Make a day trip <p> There 's a list as long as your arm of day trips to take from Darwin , but some of our favourites include Kakadu National Park , where you can hike to caves filled with ancient aboriginal rock art , Litchfield National Park , where swimming to refreshing waterholes is the order of the day , and Katherine , where a dramatic , steep-sided gorge is the ideal spot to have a go at canoeing or kayaking among the birds and wildflowers . Why not stay a while and do them all ?

Blessed with one of the globe 's most spectacular landscapes , Yosemite is simply stunning . It 's no wonder this World Heritage Site , found in northern California 's Sierra Nevada mountain range , welcomed five million visitors in 2016 , making it the USA 's third most visited national park after the Great Smoky Mountains and the Grand Canyon . Here are nine reasons why you should go too : <h> There are waterfalls aplenty <p> Yosemite National Park has a high number of waterfalls within its boundaries , many of which are strikingly tall or sheer-sided . If you want to see the cascades at their most impressive , come between April and June when the melting snows fill the rivers with water . Notable waterfalls to seek out include Yosemite Falls , the highest in North America at 739m , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical drop , and Horsetail Fall ( pictured ) , which is famous for its firefall ' , when February 's setting sun hits it at just the right angle to illuminate it in bright orange light , like lava . <h> It 's ideal for walking <p> If you like walking , you 'll be in your element in Yosemite . The park is criss-crossed by a large network of footpaths and hiking routes , with everything from a 10-minute stroll to multiday wilderness adventures on offer . Particular favourites include the Half Dome , 17 miles of waterfalls and forests that requires the help of cable wires for the final , super steep part , and the much easier hike to Glacier Point , just one mile of flat trails with fabulous views throughout . <h> You can spot wildlife <p> Not content with offering breath-taking scenery and world-class hikes , Yosemite is also home to a number of creatures that you can spot while you 're out exploring . Look out for over 90 mammal species , including bears , coyotes , raccoons , bobcats and skinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of birds , including the California spotted owl . <h> It 's worth staying the night <p> Long after the day-trippers have gone home and the sun has sunk behind the mountains , Yosemite 's night skies come to life . With very little light pollution , millions of stars light up the inky darkness and a number of local tour companies offer stargazing tours so that you can learn more about them . So , grab your telescope , look up and look out for meteor showers , comets , plants and constellations little seen in busier parts of the planet . <h> You can ski <p> Not a lot of people know that you can ski in Yosemite National Park . Not only that , but the Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area , previously known as the Badger Pass Ski Area , is the oldest ski area in California . Open from December to April for both downhill and cross-country skiing , with ski huts available for overnight ski trips , Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area is also one of just three ski areas with lifts found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear not ; lessons are available . <h> Summer activities abound <p> In summer all manner of activities are on offer in Yosemite . So if walking does n't take your fancy , why not explore the scenery with a rafting , biking or horse-riding trip ? No experience is required . For the more adventurous , Yosemite has some of the most exciting rock climbing routes in the world or , if you do n't mind getting wet , you could try white water rafting or kayaking on the Merced River or Tenaya Lake . Or just jump in " wild swimming is permitted almost everywhere . <h> The views are amazing <p> I 've mentioned the scenery already , I know , but it really is that spectacular and by far the number one reason to visit Yosemite . Even if you do nothing more than find a shady spot and look at the view , you ca n't fail to see why visitors flock to this park . The most famous of the panoramas is Tunnel View , which gives a sweeping view of Yosemite Valley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better yet , this view is n't far from the road , so you do n't have to walk far , meaning it 's accessible for everyone . <h> The park is home to giant sequoia trees <p> You might not think that Yosemite 's flora would be as interesting as its fauna , but you 'd be wrong . While the bears might steal the headlines , the park 's giant sequoia trees , towering elegantly from Mariposa Grove are quite a sight to behold . The most famous was the Tunnel Tree , which stood at 69 metres tall with a 27-metre circumference . A tunnel was cut through its base in 1881 , allowing carriages and cars to pass , and later tourists to pose for many a photo . Sadly the tree fell in 1969 at an estimated age of 2,300 years . <h> Yosemite is a park for all seasons <p> Yosemite National Park is open all year round , rain or shine , or indeed snow . Come in spring for sunny days filled with wildflowers , summer for water sports and outdoor swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing and snowshoeing . Summer is by far the most popular time to come , as all walking trails are open , while in winter parts of the park can close completely , although it 's delightfully free of crowds .

@@9537709 @2737709/ <h> 8 Things to Do in Auckland <p> Auckland , the largest city in New Zealand 's North Island , is a popular entry point for exploring the country 's mountains , hot springs and serene lakes . But before you set off to see them , do n't forget to take a look around the city itself ; you 'll be pleasantly surprised by its laid-back feel , pretty views and fabulous restaurants , all sent against the delightful backdrop of the Hauraki Gulf . Here are eight of our favourite things to do in Auckland : <h> Climb ( or jump off ) the Sky Tower <p> At 328 metres tall , Auckland 's skyline-dominating Sky Tower is officially the 25th tallest tower in the world . Nearly half a million people per year take the lift to the top , where they are treated to far-reaching views of the city and the sea beyond . The Orbit 360-C revolving restaurant is a good option up here , but for more of an adrenaline rush , you can also choose to don a full body harness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pergola , the wind whipping around you . Feeling extra brave ? Jump off ! With a harness of course , as part of the SkyJump experience . <h> Sail the Hauraki Gulf Islands <p> At the mouth of Waitemata Harbour lies a string of islands . The most famous of these , and ones you 're most likely to want to visit , are Waiheke Island ( pictured ) and Rangitoto Island , a dormant volcano with a distinctive cone-like shape . You can choose to sail amongst them on a harbour cruise , or head across on the ferry and spend the night . Rangitoto Island offers summit hikes and lava tunnels , while on Waiheke you can treat yourself to wine tasting , pristine beaches and plenty of art galleries and historic sights . <h> Go sea kayaking <p> Auckland is a great spot to try sea kayaking , whether you 're a complete beginner or have done it many times before . The sea is ( usually ) calm , the scenery spectacular and there are plenty of picnic-perfect sandy beaches to stop off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Waitemata Harbour to both Rangitoto and Waiheke Island , or even spend the night on one of the islands if you 're looking for a true adventure . If you 're very lucky you might spot the odd kiwi ( the bird ) while you 're at it . <h> Look for whales and dolphins <p> Talking of wildlife , you 've also got every chance of spotting bottlenose or common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park , sometimes in pods of 500-plus individuals . Orcas , Bryde 's whales , humpbacks and even blue whales can be seen , with the occasional sperm whale also spotted . Although you might come across a cetacean or two while kayaking , the best way to see one is on a whale and dolphin watching safari , which usually involves a short boat ride from Auckland 's Viaduct Harbour . You 'll also see gannets hunting , firing themselves into the water at speeds of 87mph in search of fish . <h> Sample the local wine <p> New Zealand is famous for its fabulous wines , and sampling them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them taste even better than usual . Wineries are all about , with four wine regions in Auckland 's immediate vicinity , so you can choose to tour the vineyards and take in the scenery on a foodie-friendly day tour or simply ensure that you order a local grape when you go out for dinner . Waiheke Island is a popular place for a sample or three due to its pretty coastal scenery and seriously tasty wines . <h> Hike up Mount Eden <p> Just over two miles south of Auckland 's city centre , Mount Eden is a dormant volcano that rises 196 metres above the surrounding streets . Resembling a large , green hill with a crater in the middle of it , a walk to the top is a pleasant way to pass a sunny morning , and will give you some spectacular views over the area . There are plenty of cafes around too , so make a day of it and stay for lunch and some suburb wandering afterwards . You can even cycle to the top if you prefer . <h> Tour the museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries in Auckland , and the difficulty is choosing which ones to visit . It depends on your interests of course , but popular options include the War Memorial Museum ( pictured ) , which covers natural , military and local history , the Museum of Transport and Technology ( MOTAT ) and the New Zealand Maritime Museum . If art 's more your bag then try the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki or the Nga Taonga Sound &amp; Vision , which displays moving image and audio . <h> Chill on the beach <p> The greater Auckland region is littered with beaches , some wide and sandy , some small and sheltered . So whether you 're looking for a place to flop down and enjoy the summer sun , or hoping to try some swimming , surfing or horse-riding in the waves , there 's definitely a beach for you . Believe it or not , you can even try snorkelling here , at the Goat Island Marine Reserve . Fishing is banned here , allowing the marine life to flourish : look out for snapper and stingrays.

Yet beyond this frenetic welcome is a city brimming with a wealth of history , art and culture , one that is home to a distinct blend of Southeast Asian , Chinese and French influences . <p> Visit Ho Chi Minh 's mausoleum and see the Cu Chi tunnels , which represent the sheer grit and determination of the Vietnamese people . The War Remnants Museum brings the harsh realities of war into focus , while the Mekong Delta and floating market showcase the soulful farmers who grow the country 's rice and intensely flavoured fruit .

You 'll find buffalo wallowing in rice paddies , coconut and fruit laden boats and cities that play home to ornate pagodas and Buddhist temples . <p> One of the loveliest things to do here is take a traditional boat trip , sitting back to be rowed down the canopy of mangrove swamps and estuaries of the Mekong river , quiet but for the rhythmic lapping of the water , the presence of swamp creatures and islands that offer reprieve to the fishermen . <p> Visit a family-run coconut candy producer to learn the simple process used to mill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix for cooling and then cutting them into small squares which are hand-wrapped and packaged . They are really delicious and a lovely gift to take home . <p> Alternately , visit a family-run rice noodle factory , which offers a fascinating look at the process and ease with which the liquid base is poured into circles , dried in the sun and then cut to noodles . <p> Cu Chi Tunnels <h> Immerse yourself in the Cu Chi tunnels <p> A guided visit will offer an excellent perspective on what is referred to in Vietnam as the American War , which saw North Vietnam supported by China and other communist allies , against South Vietnam supported by the United States and anti-communist countries . America 's occupation lasted from 1961 to 1975 and waged a devastating war against the Viet Cong and their allies in the Saigon region . <p> The Cu Chi tunnels are one of the greatest works constructed by the Vietnamese people as a place to live and hide from being attacked and served as the Viet Cong 's base of operations during this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground tunnels , now preserved as a war memorial . The tunnels served as communication and supply routes , hospitals , food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters and were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces . <p> As you will see as you venture 3m deep into one of them on your visit , it was not an easy way to live with air , food and water scarce and the tunnels infested with ants , poisonous centipedes , scorpions , spiders and snakes . You 'll have some time to watch a movie about the war , before walking around the historical battle site . <p> Floating market image : Dawn Jorgensen <h> Cai Rang floating market in Can Tho <p> Visiting a floating market in the Mekong Delta is a must for travellers to Saigon and the best place to do this is at Can Tho 's Cai Rang Floating Market . Located about 6km from Can Tho , you 'll want to get there as early as possible , joining the sellers and buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This kind of market is common in the Mekong Delta , where waterways are interconnected to people 's daily life . Traders exchange goods with farmers from the region , who in turn sell to local dealers and from there on to the neighbouring towns . <p> Each boat is marked with a pole from which the wholesaler hangs the goods he buys or sells , which is an effective way for the smaller boats to know where they need to go . There is more to be enjoyed than just selling of goods , with floating restaurants , coffee traders and insight into the lives of the people who live on the water . You 'll also pass painted boats anchored along the shore , merchant vessels carrying loads down the river and the stilt houses that hang over the water . <p> Busy Ho Chi Minh City street image : Dawn Jorgensen <h> Walking tours of the City <p> As is true of all great cities , walking offers a more intimate experience and this is certainly true with vibrant Ho Chi Minh City .

Also try banh xeo , the delicious Vietnamese crunchy pancakes , the sweet sticky rice ( Xoi Dua ) in various fruity flavors , coconut water served straight out of the shell and the distinctly sweet Vietnamese coffee . Stock up on dragon fruit , watermelon and mangosteens too . <p> Beyond the food , there is excellent shopping around Ben Thanh and you 'd do well to remember that all prices are negotiable .

Transferring out of the city by road , you 'll bike to the National Forest Park , Monkey Island , and visit the Can Gio Museum along the way . Enjoy some time in the park , cycling the extensively restored mangrove forest while on the look out for saltwater crocodiles , wild cats , otters , pythons , deer and some of the 1000 resident wild monkeys . <p> From there , canoe the Mangrove Forest Ecosystem and visit the Rung Sac Guerilla Base . The Tang Bong tower is a good place to pause and take in the views of the park .

Here are 10 of our favourite Great Barrier Reef highlights : <h> Hamilton Island <p> Nestled in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef 's Whitsunday Islands , Hamilton 's azure waters and bleached beaches are admired the world over . Once reserved for romantic honeymooners and laid-back yachties , Hamilton has stretched its restless legs and now offers quad biking , go-karting , fishing and world-class golfing , along with more than 12 miles of walking trails .

Chartering a fully crewed yacht and sailing around the Whitsunday Islands is a popular choice , but there are all sorts of cruises you can join too . With day sails on catamarans , simple there-and-back reef visits , speedboat tours from Hamilton Island or Airlie Beach , overnight snorkelling trips and luxury multiday cruises from Cairns all on offer , the choice is endless ! <h> See the reef from above <p> Flying over the Great Barrier Reef is an excellent way to take in its enormity , and to admire the wonderful shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its clear seas are blessed with an abundance of marine life , including reef sharks , trigger fish and wrasse , which you can view by glass-bottomed boat . Keep a look out for the shadows of manta rays , sometimes visible from the plane window as you fly in .

Do n't miss the Fitzroy Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre " take a look around this centre and learn about the work they do to look after sick and injured sea turtles before returning them to the wild . <h> Sleep on the reef <p> Sleeping on the Great Barrier Reef may sound like a bizarre activity , but banish all thoughts of prickly coral mattresses and rather soggy duvets , and think more floating hotel .

Prime hatching time is from December to March , where you can observe the newborns dashing frantically towards the ocean . Even if you ca n't make it for breeding season , the turtles can be seen year-round on Heron reef , so why not book a stay at the island 's only accommodation " Heron Island Resort " and observe one of nature 's greatest spectacles ? <h> Walk on the ocean floor <p> Yes , you heard us correctly .

@@9537729 @2737729/ <h> A First-Timer 's Guide to Attending an NFL Game <p> Until recently , all the knowledge I held of American football was the slogan ' clear eyes , full hearts , ca n't lose ' from American TV drama Friday Night Lights . All that changed however when , on holiday in Dallas/Fort Worth , I attended a Dallas Cowboys game at their home stadium . <p> The experience was eye-opening for many reasons , firstly in terms of just how big a spectacle it is . Before the players even run onto the field you 've got cheerleaders , mascots and fireworks trying their hardest to get the crowd going , while food and drink vendors work each aisle so you never need to miss a thing . <p> Secondly , I was amazed by how American football culture is so different to the UK . It 's seen as very much a family event , banter between the teams is quite friendly and every single person in attendance wears their team 's colours . And I mean EVERY SINGLE PERSON . <p> Needless to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few learnings to pass on : <h> Which game to go to : college , pre-season or play offs ? <p> Not all football games are made equal in America . If you 're a complete NFL ( National Football League ! ) novice and just want to experience a game for the sake of it , attending a college game is probably the easiest option in terms of getting tickets . Do n't think you wo n't get the full experience at a college game though as they 're sometimes even better in terms of live performances ( think school marching bands ) and passion ( current and previous college alumni ) , and garner just as much of a loyal following as the professional league . <p> If you 're looking to see the pros in action though , you can see them in a pre-season game from August to early September , or in the all-important play offs from early September to early February , which ends with the world famous Super Bowl . <h> How to get tickets <p> Ticketmaster is the official ticket exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top team such as the Dallas Cowboys or the New England Patriots play , you may find tickets to those games sell out within hours . If this happens , it 's possible to purchase re-sale tickets on websites like StubHub or , for a safer option , you can purchase a package through companies like Sports Traveler , which specialises in helping tourists , passionate fans and big groups attend NFL games . They even offer Super Bowl Packages if you 're looking for the ultimate experience . <h> How to get to the game <p> As you 've probably already guessed , the NFL stadiums in the USA are big . I 'm talking stadiums like those in Michigan and Ohio that seat over 100,000 people ( to put that into persepctive , Wembley Stadium in London has 90,000 seats ) . In fact , the AT&amp;T Stadium that I visited in Dallas seats 80,000 but felt so much bigger than Wembley as it had all the trimmings including luxury suites , standing areas , an art programme and , most impressively , a HD TV video screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With this mammoth size , most NFL stadiums are located reasonably far from central areas . For example , the AT&amp;T Stadium was located smack-bang between Dallas and Fort Worth , around a 30-minute drive from each city . Unfortunately , the public transport to these events is n't great , with most people opting to drive or take a dedicated NFL bus . If you book with Sports Traveler , they 'll transfer you from your hotel to the game both ways , which was a blessing , especially after the game when looking for a taxi or Uber would have been a nightmare . <h> How to attend a tailgate party <p> What was once a casual pre-game party in the parking lot of the stadium has grown into an incredible beast that involves professional-style party set ups . In fact , with stadium parking costing up to US$75 , many people opt to throw a tailgate party instead of attending the actual game . Walking to the stadium I was blown away by the amount of effort people put into the tailgate party set-up , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TVs and more . <p> If you 're not driving , but still want to attend a tailgate party , it 's possible to buy tickets to an official gathering . I attended one as part of my package with Sports Traveler and got to mingle with plenty of passionate fans , as well as enjoy a pre-game meal and drink via the all-you-can-eat buffet and open bar ( which I was delighted to find included delicious margaritas ) . After the meal I browsed the merch tents , enjoyed a meet and greet with a veteran player and watched the entertainment as rival fans got up to compete in trivia questions and dance competitions . It was an event that perfectly prepared me for the game and got me into the spirit of things . <h> What to wear <p> As soon as I entered the tent of the tailgate party I became very aware that I was the only person in the room not wearing team colours and this feeling only increased when walking to the stadium . If you want to blend in with the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's just a cap ( which is what I ended up going for ) , it 'll help you get into the spirit and tie you to a team to cheer for . <h> What to bring <p> Now this is the most important thing to know when attending an NFL game in America . There are restrictions in terms of the size and type of bag you can bring . Clutch-style bags , clear plastic tote bags up to 12x6x12 inches and one-gallon plastic freezer bags are the only types of bags permitted into the stadium . You can however store things in your pockets , which is what I opted to do in the end , and I just carried my camera in my hand . Easy !

Although Tahiti is primarily a place to relax and do very little , there are outdoorsy adventures to be found in its rugged interior , while its waters are home to plentiful marine life . As if you need any more persuading , here are six reasons to go to Tahiti : <h> The resorts are amazing <p> Tahiti is home to many hotels and resorts , most of which are found near or on its beaches . Many feature the now legendary overwater bungalows , rooms built on stilts over the ocean , allowing you to swim straight from your bed . Many international hotel groups have properties here , such as InterContinental , Sofitel and Le Meridien ( pictured ) , which is a tropical haven surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Pacific 's largest sand-bottom swimming pool . <h> You can truly get away from it all <p> If you 're looking to get far away from the stresses of modern life , relax in the sun and do absolutely nothing on holiday , then Tahiti is the place for you . You could easily fill a week doing little more than lazing on the fine white sands , ordering the occasional cocktail and cooling off with the odd swim in the pool or the ocean . Most hotels include transfers and have a choice of restaurants too , so there 's no worries about how to get around or what to eat ; you can simply lay back and take it easy . <h> There 's plenty of sealife <p> Diving and snorkelling are very popular activities here in Tahiti . Dive beneath the surface of the ocean and you 'll find all sorts of marine life , from turtles and sharks to dolphins , clown fish and manta rays . If diving 's not your thing you can choose to don a helmet and walk along the seafloor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , some overwater bungalows and hotel restaurants feature glass floors , so you can gaze at the fish over dinner . <h> Papeete 's pretty cool <p> Papeete is the capital of Tahiti and French Polynesia . But banish all visions of Paris or Berlin , Papeete is a rather functional little place with a population of just 25,000 . That said , it has a lively harbour brimming with waterside restaurants , markets and boutiques , with all sorts of Polynesian and Asian flavours available to try and locally made handicrafts to buy . The Jardins de Paofai are worth a look too for their green lawns and shady trees , as is the Notre Dame Cathedral with its striking bright yellow fa+ade . <h> Paddle boarding is a great way to get around <p> Stand-up paddle boarding seems to be all the rage these days , with everyone from Jennifer Aniston to Julia Roberts having a go . The good news is : paddle boarding is n't too strenuous and anyone try it , with Tahiti 's calm , warm seas being an ideal spot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the coastal scenery , or perhaps head to the Air France Paddle Festival , held in April in Punaauia , to see the professionals in action . <h> The forested interior is filled with adventure <p> If all that doing nothing is starting to drag , or you 've overindulged at dinner and need to wear it off , then Tahiti 's forested interior offers activities aplenty . Hire a guide and explore the Hitiaa Lava Tubes , join a 4x4 tour to Lake Vaihiria or go canyoning in the Papenoo Valley . If that 's all a bit much there are plenty of hikes to be found , including the 2-day climb to the top of 2,066m Mount Aorai or various treks in the Fautaua Velley near Papeete.

But there 's a whole lot more to the region than that : the peaks of the Himalayas tower over the far north , tigers roam the jungles and the scent of toasted spices fills the air . Whether it 's your first visit to India or your hundredth , you ca n't fail to be blown away by the chaos , colour and culture of it all . <p> Here are our top 10 suggestions for what to do while you 're here : <h> Watch the sunrise over the Taj Mahal , Agra <p> If you see just one sight in India in your lifetime , this should be it . The delicately designed fa+ade of the Taj Mahal , a monument commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631in honour of his late wife Mumtaz Mahal , changes colour depending on what time of day you visit .

To reach the fort , you have to ascend the steep pathways , a sweaty walk of around 10 minutes . Although it is possible to take a taxi ( or an elephant , but this is highly discouraged due to welfare concerns ) the walk is a much better way to take in the pretty views down to Maotha lake and the Kesar Kyari Gardens below .

One of the best is the Jama Masjid , the largest mosque in India . It 's a huge complex , with space for over 25,000 worshippers . If you like , you can climb the 40-metre-high minarets , which afford excellent views over both the mosque and the maze of streets that surround it . If there is n't a service on , it 's worth having a quick peek inside too , as marble and red sandstone detailing is exquisite . <h> Feast on north Indian cuisine <p> Northern India 's cuisine is packed full of flavour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region , especially if you 're a fan of Indian curries back home . Garam masala is a popular spice here " look out for it in the curries , such as palak paneer ( spinach and cheese ) and aloo ghobi ( potato and cauliflower ) . Dishes here are mostly vegetarian and often served with naan bread , roti or samosas , all washed down with a fresh cup of chai . <h> Cruise Udaipur 's tranquil Lake Pichola <p> After the craziness of Delhi , Agra and Jaipur , Udaipur makes a refreshing change . The city , surrounded by forested hills , backs onto the delightful Lake Pichola , giving it an open , breezy feel much-loved by local and international visitors . The best way to explore is to set off on a lake cruise , admiring the temples , ghats and houses as you go .

Visiting Varanasi 's ghats , either by boat or on foot , is a great way to gain an insight into a culture and way of life of the Varanasi people .

@@9537748 @2737748/ <h> A Long Weekend at Rio Carnival <p> I 've never travelled to South America before . Although the exotic appeal of the Latin continent has long been a temptation , for some reason I 've never had a catalyst to actually get me there . One day I found myself questioning what exactly it was that I was waiting for ; I did n't have an answer . And so , to make amends , I planned an intense long weekend in Brazil 's soon-to-be-Olympic city of Rio de Janeiro . Luckily for me , I timed my visit perfectly for the Rio Carnival . <p> When I travel I love to see and do as much as I can ( after all I only have 4 weeks annual leave each year ) so with just a few days to play with , they had to be loaded with the very best that Rio had to offer . After all , this flying visit would be plunging me head-first into the deep end of South America 's most significant cultural event . So , here 's a breakdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of my life . <h> Ascending Sugarloaf Mountain <p> Rio 's unique scenery ( think urban jungle meets actual jungle with incredible beaches thrown in for good measure ) means that any opportunity to get up high and snatch a view out over the city should be seized with both hands . In one weekend you can easily get yourself to both of Rio 's most inspiring and iconic viewpoints " Sugarloaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer . And so , on my first morning in the city , I headed up two cable cars to the summit of Sugarloaf Mountain . Despite the fact it was carnival weekend it was pretty quiet at the top when I got up there at about 10:30am . While the crowds were absent , the sun was not , so when you visit make sure you pack sun cream as well as your camera because you will definitely need both . <p> Image : Chris Steel <h> Eating , drinking &amp; dancing <p> Of course Rio has its must see ' attractions but I wanted to get a complete Rio experience rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious eating , drinking and dancing . In Rio , this means churrasco ( grilled meat ) , caipirinha ( a cocktail made with cacha+a , sugar and lime ) , and samba ( an energetic dance ) . <h> Churrasco <p> To tick off the first one , I visited Churrascaria Palace for lunch , a 60 year old Rio dining institution that 's set just off Copacabana beach ; I have never tasted meat so delicious . Churrasco is traditional Brazilian barbequed meat that is carved from giant skewers by waiters at your table . One other important fact is that it is usually all you can eat ' . They 'll bring out different types , cuts and differently seasoned meats for you to try and they 'll keep it coming so my decision to avoid the dangerously tempting buffet cart turned out to be a wise move . <p> image:Chris Steel <h> People watching at Ipanema Beach <p> At 9pm , I was due to be collected from my hotel and taken to the famous Sambadrome to see the renowned carnival parades , which meant I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 15 minutes ' walk from Leblon and Ipanema beaches , so I decided to do the local thing and run along the beachfront to work off the tonne of meat I had consumed at lunch . Of course , I 'm not used to the heat so my pace was fairly slow , but this made it easier to people watch . And it seemed that that day was a perfect day for people watching . <p> image:Chris Steel <h> Carnival time <p> At about 5pm and the main street that runs alongside Ipanema Beach was rapidly filling up with revellers in fancy dress . Opportunistic drink vendors had set up temporary stands with large cold boxes , and were trying to sell me beer as I ran along the footpath . Before long , the volume of people made it too hard to keep running so I turned back , only to realise that the way I came was now crawling with people high on the carnival air . Some of the fancy dress was amazing " I passed by a man covered in soap-suds and surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hid behind in mock embarrassment . If there is one thing I 've learned about the people of Rio , it 's that embarrassment is not an emotion they are familiar with . <p> image:Chris Steel <h> Watching the parade <p> Our minibus pulled up outside the Sambadrome at about 11pm . We stepped out to the beating of drums and into an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation . Our guide led us through various security gates before we walked out into the arena where the music was ringing out , and immediately a samba-influenced shuffle appeared in my step . For the next six hours I was closer than I could ever imagine to the greatest show on earth and I loved every minute . I could n't keep still as the rhythmic drum beat seemed to infect my body . Another side effect of being there was the permanent smile that fixed itself across my face . Each procession that passed by was more elaborate than the last . Thousands of brightly costumed participants streamed past me singing their hearts out and , hopping from one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grinned back at them . <h> The next morning <p> I did n't make it home until 8:30am the following morning when , aching from all the dancing ' , I estimated that I could get five hours sleep and still make it for lunch before being collected from my hotel for the next stage of my Rio adventure .

@@9537754 @2737754/ <h> 8 Reasons Why You Should Go To Mexico <p> Mexico has been top of my travel wish list for as long as I can remember . Those golden sandy beaches , sparkling cenotes and magnificent ruins have been calling me for years , but for one reason or another , I have never quite made it . So when I was asked where I wanted to travel to last year , I was determined not to put off a Mexican adventure any longer . I spent 10 days exploring and I loved it so much , I am already planning a return trip . Here are eight reasons why you simply have to include Mexico on your bucket list : <p> Nachos image : Tessa Watkins <h> The food is incredible <p> I am a huge fan of Mexican cuisine . Tacos and fajitas form a large part of my staple diet and I would happily eat nachos every day if I could ; so it goes without saying that I was pretty excited at the prospect of enchiladas on tap . And I was not disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plate after plate of sumptuous food . Crunchy nachos dripping in cheese , sizzling chicken and beef fajitas , crispy tacos oozing with sour cream and guacamole " I enjoyed all of this and more . The best thing I ate ? A fish tostada served in a traditional family-run restaurant on Isla Mujeres . Sometimes the simplest of dishes are the tastiest . <h> Swim with whale sharks <p> Swimming alongside the largest fish in the sea is an experience I was desperate to tick off my bucket list . Unfortunately , our visit in November meant we were off-season and I 'll have to wait until next time , but friends have regaled me with tales of what a once-in-a-lifetime experience it is . The sharks arrive to feed and mate from July to September , and August is the peak month to see them . Growing to lengths of more than 12 metres , they are seriously impressive up close , and swimming with them in the crystal waters of Isla Holbox is something I am determined to achieve on my next trip . <h> Experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , every year between 60 million and one billion Monarch butterflies make their way from eastern Canada to the forests of western central Mexico " a journey spanning more than 2,500 miles . Arriving in Mexico in October , the colourful creatures set up home in the tops of the trees high in the mountains , before the mating season during February and March . This is the best time to visit the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Michoac+n . Wander through the sanctuaries and you will see trees and leaves completely blanketed in beautiful hues of orange and black . <p> Tess at Chichen Itza image : Tessa Watkins <h> Explore Ancient ruins <p> It goes without saying that a visit to Mexico would not be complete without exploring the many ancient ruins the country is famed for . As well as Chichen Itza " one of the seven new world wonders " you can also take in Teotihuacan , the UNESCO-world heritage site of Campeche and Tulum . It may not feel like it when you 're hauling yourself up at 4am , but it really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We arrived at 8am , refreshed after a three-hour sleep on the coach journey from Cancun , and had the entire site to ourselves for half an hour . What 's more , we were able to explore before the searing midday heat became too much . <h> Swim in a cenote <p> One of the things I was most looking forward to about my Mexican adventure was diving into a cenote and enjoying a refreshing swim . After a morning spent exploring the Mayan ruins , there was nothing more appealing than a splash about in a groundwater pool . Formed as a result of limestone bedrock collapsing and exposing the groundwater underneath , you will find almost 7,000 cenotes across Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . We spent a happy hour floating around our secret swimming hole and I would have stayed there all afternoon if I could . <h> Dive off Cozumel <p> A jewel in the Caribbean Sea , Cozumel was a sleepy fishing community until 1961 , when explorer Jacques Cousteau declared it one of the most beautiful scuba diving areas he had ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations in the world , home to a year-round sunny climate , golden sandy beaches and spectacular coral reefs . I highly recommend spending a day here . Plus , if you prefer staying on dry land , there are plenty of boat tours to choose from . One of my favourite holiday memories is cruising over the glittering waters at sunset while feasting on fresh lobster and sipping my favourite cocktail . Decadent , but unforgettable . <h> Drive a golf buggy around Isla Mujeres <p> We 'd spent a few days swimming and relaxing on the beaches of Cancun when we decided we were ready for a day trip . Isla Mujeres was perfect for us ; what could be better than exploring an island on your own terms and at your own pace ? Around 13 kilometres off the coast of Cancun , Isla Mujeres is best experienced by golf buggy . You can hire these all over the island , and drive yourself around the many sites the island has to offer . From a sea turtle sanctuary to the remains of a Mayan temple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . We parked up and wandered around the local shops and markets , before stopping at a tiny restaurant overlooking the ocean . It was here that I tasted some of the best tacos I have ever eaten ( as mentioned earlier ) , washed down with a flavour-packed margarita . A mariachi band even serenaded us as we ate ! <h> Watch sea turtles hatch <p> Thousands of sea turtles come ashore in Mexico every year to lay their eggs , and the Yucatan Peninsula is one of the best places to experience this . Head for Akumal Bay , X'Cacel Beach and Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve between July and October to witness the turtles hatch , and you can even help expert guides release them back into the ocean . Sadly , our visit fell out of turtle season " just another reason why I simply have to return . <p> Jet off to Mexico with Round the World Experts ' Mexico Holidays , or give your Expert a call today .

@@9537757 @2737757/ <h> Orangutans in the Mist : Jungle Trekking in Indonesia <p> I could see the whites of his eyes . Well actually that 's not strictly true , unlike us , orangutans have dark brown eyeballs " something I learned as a huge 150kg male hung motionless in the trees a few feet from me . His faced turned towards ours , just watching ... <p> Earlier that morning I met my jungle guide , Ketut , in a tiny town named Bukit Lawang deep in the Sumatran rainforest . Nestled along a river , Bukit Lawang has no ATM , few guesthouses and can only be reached by an arduous , pothole-plagued journey by road . <p> In the early hours the breaking dawn signals the call of the jungle . The screeching cries of wild primates and the vibrant birdsong resonates through the valley , bringing with them a sense of lingering expectation . Here the trekking guides gather , the walking boots are laced and a short walk away a simple stone rises out of the vegetation , stoically marking the boundary of the national park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alien ecosystem , praying it would be long enough to spot an orangutan ( or two ! ) from afar . Sumatra has made its name as one of the few remaining places in the world that you can still see wild orangutans in their native jungle , and without which no trip to Indonesia would be complete . So focused on catching a glimpse of the great ape , I almost forgot that the rainforest would be home to a multitude of other captivating creatures and nearly fainted with excitement when within ten minutes , we found ourselves surrounded by a 70-strong family of long-tailed macaques . Curious and unfazed , they continued their journey through the bush around us and I found myself face-to-face with a new mother who had her tiny , hairless baby clinging to her chest , its big unblinking brown eyes looking right at me . <p> We pressed on through the muggy undergrowth and I tried my best to ignore the sweat clinging to my back . Ketut 's pace quickened and we soon saw a group of other hikers with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze and there it was , our first orangutan ! Peering back at us , bemused , a mother sat high up in the tree canopy as her young son played with the vines , learning to swing between trees . He also learned to throw sticks , it seemed , and we moved on as broken twigs rained down on our heads . <p> The lunch we were given was simple but utterly glorious ; warm spicy rice wrapped in banana leaf was eaten with our hands , followed by fresh passion fruit , rambutan and sweet pineapple . Just as we were about to throw away the pineapple rinds , Ketut motioned for us to look behind the log we were using as a seat . He had spotted it a while ago , but with his wicked sense of humour had decided to let it get unbelievably close before he pointed it out . A large male baboon silently crept up behind us , eyeing up our fruit before scurrying away into the undergrowth with some leftovers . <p> That night we descended into the valley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . I took the coldest , yet possibly the most welcome shower I have ever taken in a natural waterfall to wash away the day 's grime . It took only a few seconds before I was lost in my thoughts , just watching the stunning natural world go by from my refreshing vantage point . Dragonflies landed on my outstretched arms as the last of the afternoon sun fell through the leaves onto my skin , and I felt completely care-free . <p> During our trek we barely saw another living soul , Ketut liked to stay away from the other trekking groups for a more authentic jungle experience . He broke his rule once more , though . The guides would fill their lungs and bellow out loud calls that to the untrained ear , sounded like any other wild primate call , but signalled to each other the presence of something worth seeing . One day he heeded the calls and that 's when we came within a few meters of one of the largest male orangutans in the forest . He hung low between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round face slowly rotating to make direct eye contact with each of us in turn . <p> When you find yourself so close to any of these amazing creatures , it 's easy to see why they are so loved by researchers and are the source of such intrigue . Instantly , it felt as though we were staring into the eyes of another , albeit slightly hairier , human . There was a common understanding ; a mutual acceptance of intelligence and an unspoken agreement to keep ones distance in order to happily coexist . <p> Nothing showcased the intelligence and learning capabilities better than an orang-utan affectionately-named Jackie , though . The following evening we arrived at our second camp to meet her , a female orangutan with two children in tow ; one tiny baby and one cheeky youth . This family was far from domesticated or tame , but had on occasion ventured down into the camp to steal biscuits from the hikers . Orangutans are incredibly observant animals and from her previous visits Jackie had learned that , much like the humans , she too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . <p> While we were distracted , baffled even , watching her on the edge of the river , the older of her children made a swing for my raised camera but missed , grabbing instead my ponytail for a ( slightly painful ) memory that I will never forget . He later scampered into our tent , stealing loose items of clothing and handkerchiefs to take with him as he rushed back into the trees , only to rip up and drop them once he 'd had his fun . <p> The three days spent in the jungle were exhausting but utterly exhilarating . We made our way downstream back to Bukit Lawang , clinging onto a raft made from huge air-filled tyres , recounting stories and marvelling at how spoilt we had been with all that we had seen . It may have been the first , but it certainly wo n't be the last time I set foot in a rainforest . <p> Talk to an Expert today about jungle trekking in Indonesia on a tailor-made Journey or see our wildlife holiday ideas .

Like little printed travel medals that transport you back to a time and a place , every time you spot them on the page . <p> In my passport , my most prized stamp would be for Norfolk Island , a tiny island territory located between Australia , New Zealand and New Caledonia . Not everyone you come across has a Norfolk Island stamp , and it 's for that reason that it 's my favourite . <p> There are a few other stamps I 'd like to see within the pages of my passport though . Here I count down the five passport stamps I 'd like to brag about . <h> Antarctica <p> A visit to Antarctica will earn you a cute red penguin stamp , and the bragging rights of having visited the coldest and driest continent on earth .

To make sure you enjoy a comfortable stay , talk to your Round the World expert . <h> Easter Island <p> With flights to Easter Island are only possible via Santiago , not everyone is up to the trek . Those who do make the journey though are rewarded with a mystical island sporting 887 mysterious statues , and a statue in their passport to match !

Whether you decide to take the breathtaking Incan Trail with a guide or go it alone and head straight to Machu Picchu , all visitors are required to purchase tickets and show their passport upon entry .

@@9537761 @2737761/ <h> 8 Things to Do in Namibia <p> Featured destinations : Namibia <p> Published 04 January 2017 <p> Angela Griffin <p> The first time I went to Namibia , I expected a safari destination teeming with wildlife . What I got was a landscape plucked from another planet , a refreshing lack of people and buildings , and mile upon mile of vast open skies presiding over the desert sands . Yes , there is excellent safari to be had , but it 's really not about that ; it 's more about the peace and quiet of the wilderness , and spending your days far removed from anything resembling the modern world . <p> I love Namibia so much I got a job selling Namibia safaris , and spent months in the country writing and researching a Namibia travel guide . I have good Namibian friends , and feel I know the place better than any other country outside the UK . Here are my favourite things to do here : <h> Climb Dune 45 in Sossusvlei <p> Sossusvlei , a collection of bright orange dunes and swirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other place I 've ever been . In the centre of the dune cluster , you 'll find Deadvlei , a collection of scorched trees that are unable to rot due to the extreme sun , even though they died in a drought 700 years ago . Apart from depleting your camera battery , the thing to do here is to climb a dune , and Dune 45 , at 170m tall , is one of the most accessible . Climb in the morning and watch the sunrise , or try the sunset like I did and watch the desert turn every shade of purple as the stars appear in the sky . <p> Look for desert adapted elephants in Damaraland <p> Found only in Namibia and Mali , the desert adapted elephant is a close relative of the more commonly known African bush elephant , it 's just that this one has special features to allow it to live in harsh , dry conditions . For example , these pachyderms have larger feet to help them walk on the soft sands , and longer trunks to enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll need to head to Damaraland or Kaokoland in Namibia 's north , a remote and beautiful place of russet rocks and dazzling night skies . <p> Surf the sands in Swakopmund <p> On Namibia 's west coast , Swakopmund is a strange little place . The first time I visited it reminded me of something out of The Prisoner , its colourful houses lining empty , dusty streets that lead nowhere at all . Aside from gorging on bratwurst and Black Forest gateau in this former German colony , Swakopmund 's attractions lie in the surrounding desert . And , for me , top of the list is sandboarding : whizzing down a duneside with a snowboard attached to your feet . It 's not quite as fast as real snowboarding , but still heaps of fun . Warning : you 'll find sand in every crevice for days afterwards . <p> Kayak with seals in Walvis Bay <p> Just south of Swakopmund , Walvis Bay has less of the fanfare enjoyed by its more famous neighbour , resulting in a far more chilled-out place . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter than in Swakopmund , so for me , it 's the more appealing of the two towns . My favourite activity here is kayaking with seals on the Pelican Point peninsula . They 're curious creatures , and will come right up to your kayak to say hello and give you a friendly splash . If you are very lucky you might spot the odd passing dolphin too . <p> Gaze across Fish River Canyon <p> At 100 miles long and 550 metres deep , Fish River Canyon is the largest canyon in Africa and second only to the Grand Canyon for impressiveness . Having never been to the Grand Canyon , it 's by far the most remarkable canyon I 've ever seen . To take it in , your best bet is a rim hike , although with a bit of prior planning it 's possible to trek down into it too . I 've been lucky enough to stay at the wonderful Fish River Lodge , where the rooms are perched right on the cliff edge , looking out over the vast chasm below . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L++deritz , a fascinating destination in its own right , Kolmanskop is a former diamond mining settlement . Once very prosperous , the town fell into decline after World War I and , after being completely abandoned in 1954 , fell into disrepair . The wind brought the desert sands into its buildings , which include houses , a school , a theatre and a bowling alley , and you can take a look around on the daily guided tours . It 's an eerie place , and a snapshot of a forgotten time that to me feels post-apocalyptic , like something out of a movie . <h> Go on safari in Etosha National Park <p> Top of the Namibian game-viewing areas is Etosha National Park , a huge reserve whose numerous waterholes attract thirsty giraffes , elephants and zebra , where leopards laze in the mopane trees and rhinos roam across the salt pans . One of the joys of Etosha is driving yourself " the roads are good and the waterholes well signposted " but if that does n't appeal , join a guided 4X4 safari and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the beaten track in the Caprivi Strip <p> Look at the above picture and you would n't guess it was taken in Namibia ; there 's far too much water ! On Namibia 's panhandle ' this little-known region is a far cry from the dusty deserts of the centre . Here , the Kwando and Chobe Rivers flow through wildlife-rich national parks before joining the Zambezi River and dropping dramatically over Victoria Falls . A drive along the strip " stopping to search for hippos and crocs on a river safari or two , and calling in at Botswana 's Chobe National Park to spot elephants before entering Zambia or Zimbabwe at Victoria Falls " is the stuff of true African adventure . My top tip : look out for elephants crossing the road . <p> Chat to your Expert for further information about our holidays to Namibia

Think again ! In fact , this beautiful mountain resort is open all year round for hiking , biking and scenery watching , and with plenty to do that does n't involve going anywhere near a set of skis , it makes a lovely addition to any west coast Canada itinerary . Here are our top eight things to do there , other than skiing : <h> Snowshoeing <p> If you 've never tried snowshoeing before , then why not ? Suitable for all ages and abilities , this is basically walking with some rather large shoes strapped to your feet , stopping you from sinking into the snow . Whistler 's trails are easy to follow , so you do n't need a guide . Instead , take your time exploring the winter forests , spotting animals and birds as you go . This activity could n't be easier ; you can even take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking trails , with paths ranging from short and flat to steep and challenging . Just like snowshoeing , routes are well marked , and you do not need a guide , just a good map and a sense of fun . Be sure to wear good walking boots , take lots of layers and plenty of water , and keep your eyes open for chipmunks . You could even take the Peak 2 Peak Gondola to Blackcomb to access even more trails . Wherever you go , the views are sure to be stupendous . <h> Snowmobiling <p> For snowmobiling you will need a guide , as this is a little more technical . But do n't worry , no experience is required as you take to the slopes and follow the pathways through the trees . Some snowmobile tours include a meal in a cosy fireside mountain lodge , or take place at night so you can zip about by moonlight , underneath a blanket of stars . <p> image credit : Sandinave Spa <h> Pampering <p> There 's no shortage of spas in Whistler , with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Four Seasons , having their own onsite . For something a little more magical , you could try the lovely Scandinave Spa , which features various steam baths , saunas and waterfalls , set in the heart of nature surrounded by peaceful forest . They offer a full range of treatments too , so if your legs are weary after all the hiking and snowshoeing , this is the place to come . <h> Wildlife watching <p> Believe it or not , there 's plenty of wildlife to be found in and around Whistler , from bears and deer to hares and birds . The smaller creatures can often be spotted as you walk or snowshoe through the forests , but you 'd have to be incredibly lucky ( or unlucky , depending on how you look at it ) to see a bear . For your best chances , try one of Whistler 's bear viewing tours , which take you to the bears ' natural habitats by 4x4 and allow you to get pretty close . Just do n't forget your camera . <h> Zip-lining <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try zip-lining ? You 'll be strapped into a harness and gloves , tied to a metal rope and off you go , sliding along across the valleys , flying like a bird . Zip-lining tours give you a great aerial view of Whistler 's forests and streams , and take place in both winter and summer . One zip line is 731m long and descends over 30 storeys " dare you try it ? <h> Kayaking and canoeing <p> Canoeing and kayaking are great ways to explore Whistler 's lakes and rivers . Popular spots include the lovely Lake Garibaldi ( pictured ) and the wonderfully-named River of Golden Dreams , both of which offer superb mountain views . If you want to try something a little different , you can even try stand-up paddle boarding , although do be prepared to get wet . <p> Head to Whistler in summer or winter with Round the World Experts ' Whistler Holidays .

@@9537777 @2737777/ <p> Varanasi , which is also known as Kashi or Benares , roughly translating to the City of Life , dates as far back as 1200 BC and is the one of Hinduism 's seven holy cities . For Hindus , a trip to India 's spiritual capital may be one of the most significant journeys that they will undertake in their life ; with many embarking upon pilgrimages from across the globe in hopes to purify their soul in the Ganges ' waters , as well as cremating their loved ones " and hopefully releasing them from their cycle of reincarnation " along the riverbank 's ghats . <p> This ancient city is also where the Hindu deity Shiva is thought to have lived , as well as where Buddha was believed to have founded Buddhism and delivered his first sermons . <p> It is difficult to capture this magical city 's true essence in words , but you 'll find that it 'll be easy to be inevitably swept up in the intoxicating sounds , colours , aromas , rituals , personalities and overall spirituality of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to Varanasi is completely life-changing , be it dramatically enlightening or overwhelmingly humbling . Whatever your take , you will at the very least be left with a long lasting impression of a place that most likely got under your skin and shifted your perspective , even in some small way . It is a sight not to be missed when travelling in India . <p> To make the most of your break , here are the seven things I recommend doing while in the city . <h> Wander along the famous ghats <p> Stretching along the western banks of the River Ganges are the ghats , colourfully painted temples and steps leading down to the water . Take time to explore this picturesque part of Varanasi as it offers a fascinating glimpse into the city 's daily life . Here you 'll see people engaged in a number of diverse activities including yoga , selling flowers and religious offerings , washing clothes , bathing and worshipping the river itself . You will also see brightly robed priests offering spiritual services , many different animals grazing and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traditional Hindu cremation ceremony <p> The ghats are also where you will find the ceremonial cremations taking place . These occur at the Burning Ghats and offer an extremely daunting yet deeply moving experience insight into Hinduism 's time-honoured traditions surrounding the commemoration of their dead . You 'll be faced with rather confronting images of mourning processions and funeral pyres , as well as large numbers of the elderly and sick who travel here to live out their last days . But for many , it also conjures a moment for reflection and even spiritual awakening , with visitors often taking time to ponder over life 's mysteries , as they watch the vivid events unfold around them . <h> Take a dip in the holy Ganges <p> Those who follow the Hindu faith believe that the river is in fact the living embodiment of Ganga , the elder sister of Parvati , Shiva 's wife , and hence regard and worship the water as a living and breathing goddess . Holy scriptures encourage followers to bathe in the Ganges in order to wash away the sins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soul 's final journey to Nirvana . You 'll see people taking to the waters around sunrise ; if you 're daring enough to brave the morning temperatures , why not take the plunge yourself ! <h> Make time for the evening Puja ceremony <p> Every evening at the Dasaswamedh Ghat , commonly known as the Main Ghat , the Ganga Aarti ritual is held at around 6pm . Here you will see priests honouring Shiva through dance , chants , music and fire in a mesmerising performance . Thousands of oil lamps and candles are then set afloat along the water , for an enchanting finale that sees the river lit up by the illuminated offerings . <h> Experience a boat ride at dawn and dusk <p> Visiting Varanasi and not taking a boat ride would be like going to Agra and not visiting the Taj Mahal ; it just has to be done ! These rides offer a contrasting view of the area , as well as the opportunity to view the scenery and its people in full panoramic glory ! <p> The morning ride will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rising sun , as well as people taking part in varying activities in the river and along the banks . Go in the evening and you 'll feel further immersed in the Puja ceremony as you float on waters surrounded by the glow of the candle-lit river . <h> Get lost in the city 's galis <p> The galis are labyrinth-like narrow alleys and streets located close to the ghats . They are fascinating to explore and equally as challenging to navigate . But you 'll never be lost for too long , as you 'll eventually always end up back at the river , enabling you to easily find your way again " plus it 's all part of the fun ! Here you 'll see a vibrant variety of shops , markets , restaurants , animals , street art , shrines , temples and more all cosily tucked away , just waiting to be discovered . <h> Explore Varanasi 's temples and fort <p> Unsurprisingly , there are temples at literally every turn in Varanasi , but the grand Viswanath Temple is the most important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside is stunning in itself . There is also the Buddhist Dhamekh Stupa , located 10km north-east of the city , and the place where Buddha was believed to have first preached . <p> Finally , Ramnagar Fort offers a change of scenery along the eastern banks of the river . The lavish 17th Century structure has long been used as a royal residence , as well as a film location ; and its museum houses an eccentric collection of American vintage cars , weaponry , jewel encrusted sedan chairs , intricately patterned elephant saddles and more . <p> Visit India on a Journey with Round the World Experts .

Here are some of the most egg-ceptional ( sorry ) : <p> For those not au fait with all things craft , decoupage is a decorative art form whereby coloured paper is cut into shapes then glued and varnished onto an object , often a box , a wooden chair or , in this case , an egg . While decoupage is practised all over the globe , this method of Easter egg decoration is particularly popular Stateside as it 's an easy do-it-yourself way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the San tribe who first engraved ostrich eggs , using the surprisingly sturdy vessels as water carriers . Decorated eggs thought to be over 60,000 years old have been found in South Africa 's Richtersveld region , and while they have n't got anything to do with Easter , they 've inspired countless artists to create their own versions for the spring festival . Ostrich eggs have thick shells , making carving an easier option than with plain old chicken eggs ; sometimes holes are drilled into the shell and lights put inside to make an attractive lampshade . <p> Originating in Japan , washi paper , made from natural fibres such as bamboo or tree bark , was traditionally used for origami , painting and woodblock printing . These days , since the invention of washi tape " which is similar to masking tape but comes in a wide variety of colours and pretty designs " washi is a popular crafting tool not just in Japan , but all over the world . Simply stick the tape to the egg in the desired pattern and enjoy . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter eggs are a Ukrainian tradition thought to be over 2,000 years old . In a process similar to batik , brightly coloured designs are drawn on using beeswax . The egg is then dyed , but the paint does n't stick to the wax so , when the wax is removed , a lighter shape remains underneath . At Easter , Ukrainians play a game called egg tapping , whereby they tap each other 's eggs together until only one person is left with a non-broken egg , and declared the winner . <h> Painted Easter eggs , Romania <p> Visit Romania at Easter and you 'll see painted eggs all over the place . While they may look pretty , painting them is a time-consuming process that requires accuracy and a steady hand , as well as a touch of creativity . The colours are significant too " red symbolises love , black represents eternity , yellow is youth and green is nature . Designs vary from region to region and all have their own meanings , which you can learn all about at the Museum of Decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter eggs , Slovakia <p> As Easter approaches in Slovakia , decorated eggs start to appear in shops and markets , egg exhibitions pop up , and classes are offered so that you can learn how to decorate your own . It 's not just carving that 's popular either ; Slovaks also use the same batik method as Ukraine : dye their eggs with herbs or plants , paint them , or wrap them in wire , wool , leather or lace . <p> Otherwise known as cascarones , Mexico 's take on the Easter egg involves a hollowed out chicken egg filled with glitter , confetti or small toys . These eggs , usually decorated or at least painted on the outside , are thrown at people 's heads , showering them in confetti and supposedly bringing good luck . They are n't just an Easter thing either , as cascarones are often seen at Halloween , Cinco de Mayo and Day of the Dead celebrations , and occasionally at weddings . <p> Vegreville , Alberta , is home to the Vegreville Egg , a rather impressive roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Ukrainian pysanka , this giant art installation is nine metres long and weighs 2.5 tons , which made it the largest Easter egg in the world until it was overtaken by the one in Kolomyia , Ukraine , in 2000 . It is notable for the fact that it is made up of 2D tiles , fitted onto a 3D structure , which involved some complicated mathematical equations eventually solved by geometrist Ronald Resch from the University of Utah . <h> Onion peel Easter eggs , Greece <p> While there are many methods used to dye Easter eggs , in Greece they are traditionally coloured using onions skins and vinegar , creating kokkina avga , or ceremonial eggs . Usually made on Holy Thursday , along with tsoureki , Greek Easter bread , the first finished egg is used to ward off evil , while the rest are used to play tsougrisma , an egg tapping game similar to the Ukrainian version mentioned above . <h> Mona de Pascua , Spain <p> This Easter cake is a Spanish favourite , baked to symbolise the end of lent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by godparents to their godchildren , and originally took the form of a giant doughnut topped with hard boiled eggs , with the number of eggs representing the age of the godchild .

Sold at bakeries across the country , they 're very popular , especially in Catalonia , where around 6000,000 are sold every year on Easter Monday .

All that 's left is the matter of paying for it <h> How much do you really need ? <p> To give you an estimate cost of travelling ( which can vary widely , depending on your destinations and the level of luxury you need ) the ball park figure is around -1,000 a month ( not including pre-trip expenses ) . Of course , in cheaper countries such as those found in Asia , you can get by , comfortably , on a lot less . Then again , if you want to go skydiving in Australia and glacier hiking in New Zealand , you need to allow considerably more . <p> Now , that figure is just what you should aim for whilst you are on the road , let 's not forget the all-important <h> Pre-trip expenses <p> When you decide to save for a RTW trip , do not underestimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've even stepped foot on the plane , which brings us to the obvious : plane tickets . <p> If you can be flexible , look around for the best deals that stop at your main destinations . Do n't worry if the route does n't include every destination on your list : overland travel is the norm in many places . <p> For example , you want to go to Thailand , Vietnam , Cambodia , Malaysia and Singapore , grab a flight that drops you off in Singapore , travel up for a few weeks and fly onwards to your next destination from Bangkok . Use the cheap ( and sometimes cheerful ) buses and trains that connect the whole region.Next are the other major costs : vaccinations , travel insurance and visas " my latest trip set me back almost -400 in visas before I 'd even left the country ! Add these up and you could have quite a sizable figure . Add the things you may need to invest in prior to leaving , such as a backpack and walking shoes , and you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even get yourself away . Still , the bright side is once these major expenses are paid for , you never have to think about them and there is no going back ! <p> So with pre-trip expenses taken care of , savings must commence . There is a wealth of ways ( no pun intended ) you can save for your trip and here are just a few . <h> Have a set target each month <p> Be strict with yourself here " but not so strict you have to miss out on everything and end up becoming a social recluse " and set yourself a savings target . Quantitative targets are great as they mean you can really measure and track your progress . Set up a direct debit from your main bank each payday , or if your wages vary aim to save a certain percentage . As you see the total figure steadily climbing each month , knowing you are getting closer and closer to your ultimate total , and dream trip , is incentive enough to keep going ! <h> Open up a high-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , it is wise to open a savings account with a high interest rate . If you 're not familiar with all the jargon that comes with the world of banks , a quick Google search will soon provide you with various money saving forums that will point you in the right direction . Once you 're all set up , sit back and enjoy the free money as it rolls in each month . The more you add to your savings account , the more interest you will earn . The interest I accrued during my recent saving stint paid for accommodation in Paris , for 5 nights , and 2 people . And , it took all of 5 minutes to open . <h> Sell everything you own <p> Okay , well , not literally , but selling unwanted possessions can make you a few bob . Ebay is a great way to sell your unwanted stuff ; a few photos and good description later you could be onto a winner . As the saying goes " one man 's junk is another man 's treasure ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds up and depending on how much you sell and how much time you have , you could make a few hundred which can go a long way when you 're on the road . <h> Do n't be too hard on yourself <p> Making yourself miserable is no good . If you 're going away on a dream trip , the experience of a lifetime , you do n't want to spend the months building up to departure wallowing in your own existence . Instead , if you feel you need a treat , or fancy a meal out one evening , by all means do it . Just not every night or every day . When saving I would always allow myself to maintain some kind of social life " saving does not have to mean you are trapped at home ; you just have to make your decisions more wisely .

@@9537788 @2737788/ <h> 4 Things to Do in Kuranda <p> A tiny , picturesque village in the heart of the rainforest , Kuranda is a true Queensland gem . Easily explored in a day , Alexandra Gregg had just half that time to make the most of its many offerings " here are her top recommendations for things to do in Kuranda : <h> Soar above the rainforest <p> Gondolas are 10-a-penny these days , but going on one that stretches for 4.5 miles over the rainforest canopy " and used to be the longest in the world " is something else entirely . That 's the experience we got when we took the Rainforest Cableway up to the village of Kuranda . If done in one solid hit , the journey takes a sedentary 45 minutes , serving up views of the forest , the Coral Sea and even Cairns . It 's best to spread out the trip though and stop-off en route , like we did . <p> The Kuranda Skyrail ( Image : Alexandra Gregg ) <p> First there was Red Peak Station , where we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees ( the strangler fig was my favourite ) . Our guide talked a bit about the history of the Skyrail , as well as the age-old forest that surrounded us : the Daintree , better known as the oldest continually surviving rainforest on the planet . <p> Touring the rainforest at Red Peak Station ( Image : Alexandra Gregg ) <p> At Barron Falls Station we went off-piste , no guide this time , and walked purposefully along the boardwalks until we reached the highlight : a lookout point over the steep , majestic cascades of Barron Falls ( 125m ) . The deep chasm boasted an emerald fringing , not to mention natural pools ripe for swimming in . Even better : the lookout was incredibly peaceful and the only sound that disturbed the silence was the thunderous roar of the falls . <h> Explore the markets <p> When you finally reach the top , there 's plenty to keep you busy in this diverse village . Souvenir hunters will be spoilt for choice at the original and heritage markets , both of which sell a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather purses and bags , wooden ornaments and jewellery . There 's plenty to keep you fed and watered : try a coconut cocktail ( in a real coconut ! ) before munching on some Queensland grown macadamia nuts . <p> The Koala Gardens at Kuranda ( Image : Alexandra Gregg ) <h> Meet the wildlife <p> We were desperate to meet the wildlife in Kuranda , and started with the butterfly sanctuary " home to over 1,500 of these technicolour creatures and the biggest aviary of its kind in the southern hemisphere . The vibrancy and sheer volume of them brought me to a halt . As I stood , soaking up the beauty of them all , they fluttered all around and one even landed on my hand . They reckon the brighter the clothes you wear , the more likely it is that the butterflies will be attracted to you . <p> Birdworld Kuranda ( Image : Alexandra Gregg ) <p> With little time to dawdle , we powered onto Birdworld Kuranda next to see the infamous southern cassowary and plenty of free-roaming lorikeets and cockatoos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .

Despite following much the same route as the Skyrail , it 's a completely different experience . Rather than chugging above the rainforest , you 're completely ensconced by it , seeing all the same sights but from an entirely unique vantage point . There 's the element of danger too " the train leaps over death-defying drops and bridges that will undoubtedly make your heart pound , while serving up spectacular views of the forest and the coast as you make your descent .

While it might not be a road trip in the traditional sense , trains and buses between North American cities can be an economical and fun way to get between your destinations , especially if you are mainly interested in cities . <p> So , do n't worry if a road trip across North America sounds daunting , sit back and relax on the way to your next destination .

@@9537798 @2737798/ <h> What to see in the Galapagos Islands <p> For the ultimate wildlife adventure , a cruise on the turquoise waters of the Galapagos Islands is hard to beat . Found 563 miles west of Ecuador , the archipelago is made up of 13 major islands and six smaller ones , with over 100 islets too , some little more than a lonely rock jutting out of the ocean . Home to numerous endemic species , the islands were made famous by Charles Darwin , who used the results of his studies there to write his ground-breaking Theory of Evolution . Today , around 25,000 people live in the Galapagos Islands , with many more coming to see the unique wildlife . <p> To help you choose which islands to put on your Galapagos must-see list , we 've summarised the best things to see on each island . Just to confuse matters , most have both Spanish and English names , which often do n't resemble each other at all . Here we 've put the more common Spanish names first with the English names in brackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Floreana was one of the first of the Galapagos Islands to be inhabited when a colony of political prisoners was established here in 1832 . Nowadays , the main reason to stop by is Post Office Bay , known for its unusual postal system whereby letters are posted into a barrel and passers-by root through them to see if there are any they can deliver to their homeland . Wildlife-wise , there 's a good chance of spotting stingrays at Devil 's Crown , an underwater volcanic cone where you 'll also find flamingos and nesting sea turtles from December to May . <h> The Cerro Negro Crater on Isabela ( Albemarle ) <p> The largest of the Galapagos Islands , Isla Isabela is dominated by the 1,707m peak of Wolf Volcano , the archipelago 's highest point . Hiking and biking among the steaming fumaroles and vents of the mars-like Cerro Negro Crater are popular activities here , especially when the panoramic island views emerge from the mists . Look out for white-tipped reef sharks on the Las Tintoreras Peninsula , also home to turtles , penguins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tupiza Tortoise Breeding Centre . <h> Blue-footed boobies on North Seymour <p> It may be a small island ( just 0.73 square miles ) but North Seymour has a lot going on . The highlights here are the blue-footed boobies and the swallow-tailed gulls , but there are also land and marine iguanas , Galapagos sea lions and incense trees to find . Snorkel the clear blue seas to spot various colourful fish as well as white-tipped reef sharks , rays and sea lions , and walk through the cactus forest to find red-billed tropicbirds . Frigate birds , with bright red pouches on their necks , are particularly photogenic favourites . <h> Tortoise on San Cristobal ( Chatham ) <p> As you cruise into San Cristobal , look out for Kicker Rock , a dramatic rocky protrusion about 1.5 miles offshore . Both Galapagos and hammerhead sharks flock here , so enter the water and see what you can find . On San Crist+bal itself , head to the wildlife-rich Laguna El Junco , the largest freshwater lake in the Galapagos , blessed with large numbers of frigate birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoises try the Jacinto Gordillo Breeding Center , where you can see both the newly-hatched youngsters and some 100-year-old specimens . <h> Sally Lightfoot crabs on Santa Cruz ( Indefatigable ) <p> There 's plenty to see in Santa Cruz : choose from spotting Darwin finches , woodpeckers , warbler finches and vermillion flycatchers in the misty forests of the Highlands , searching for giant tortoises in the cool cloud forests , or looking for iguanas and Galapagos mockingbirds at Cerro Dragon ( Dragon Hill ) , which also offers fabulous views of the bay below . There 's a lovely beach at Las Bachas , just right for swimming , sun lazing or spotting nesting Pacific green turtles . Walk along the soft , bright white sands , or snorkel among the Sally Lightfoot crabs . And do n't miss the dense mangroves of Tortuga Negra Cove . <h> Penguins on Sombrero Chino ( Chinese Hat ) <p> The hat-like shape of Sombrero Chino is one of the most recognisable sights of the Galapagos Islands .

Watch sea lions bask and crabs scuttle and look out for white-tipped reef sharks and Galapagos penguins . <h> The best of the rest <p> To get off the beaten track in the Galapagos , you 'll need to head to the lesser-known islands . They may not have the gravitas of San Cristobal or Isabela , but there 's still plenty to discover . Try the inquisitive sea lions of Isla Lobos , or the dive-bombing boobies and bright red lava crabs of Isla Mosquera , which look particularly fetching when contrasted against the black lava rocks . The far out location of Espanola and Genovesa ( Tower ) Islands mean that they are rarely visited , but their remoteness has encouraged the evolution of unique species such as the Espanola marine iguana , the only iguana to change colour in breeding season . Penguin fans should try Isla Fernandina ( Narborough ) or Isla Rabida ( Jervis ) which boasts pretty red sands due to its high iron content .

But despite being the underdog in the fiercely fought Southeast Asian popularity contest , Laos has much to offer the unhurried traveller . Scratch beneath the surface of its verdant rice fields and discover cultural wonders , karst landscapes and a wealth of outdoor activities . Just do n't tell Thailand . <p> To showcase Laos ' best bits , we 've chosen five of our favourite places that we know you 'll love . <h> Luang Prabang <p> Atmospheric Luang Prabang is a World Heritage city filled with golden wats and orange-clad monks , located at the confluence of the Mekong and the Khan rivers . The town is stuffed with treasures , such as Haw Kham , the national museum , which was once the Royal Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you can prise yourself out of bed at dawn , watch a traditional alms ceremony . Do n't miss Wat Xieng Thong , a glittering temple filled with gold , coloured glass and mosaics ; its shrines , towers and gardens together form one of the most important monasteries in Laos . <h> Vang Vieng <p> On the banks of the Nam Song River in central Laos , Vang Vieng has pushed aside its former reputation as a party town and emerged stronger , prettier and more peaceful than before . Since the government shut down the once ubiquitous riverside bars and the backpackers moved out , the town has returned to its roots , becoming a lovely stop for families and couples who come to appreciate its natural beauty . By far the most relaxing way to do this is to hop into a river tube and float down the Nam Song , taking in the backdrop of jagged cliffs and rice fields as you go . For outdoorsy types , rock climbing , river kayaking and mountain biking are on offer too . <h> Vientiane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relaxed Vientiane . Here , long lazy days can be filled browsing the exhibits at the Lao National Museum or posing for photos by the Patuxai Victory Gate ( pictured ) . For a grand day out , the mirror-like waters of Nam Ngum Lake or the region 's quaint island fishing villages are worthwhile options , or just wander the leafy , flower-filled lawns of Buddha Park , home to over 200 quirky Hindu and Buddhist statues , including a giant pumpkin . But our favourite activity here is to indulge in a freshly-baked croissant and a frothy cappuccino or two from one of the many bakeries and watch the world go by . <h> Plain of Jars <p> Probably Laos ' most unusual attraction , the Plain of Jars is a collection of thousands of stone jars scattered across the valleys of Phonsavan , a fascinating throwback to a long-forgotten civilisation . No one is quite sure of the jars ' origins , and no doubt your guide will regale you with a convoluted tale of his own creation , but they are thought to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains and ceramics found here corroborate this . While you 're in the area it 's also worth wandering around the town of Phonsavan itself , where you should n't be too surprised to see bomb shells left behind by the Vietnam War used as doorstops and plant pots . <h> Wat Phu Champasak <p> Giving Cambodia 's Angkor Wat a run for its money , 12th century Wat Phu is a crumbling Hindu temple built by the Khmer . With far fewer visitors than its more famous counterpart , it 's more of a spiritual place , not least due to its mountainside setting and lush flower-filled surrounds .

This was the beginning of our five-day jungle trek into the Amazon . <p> And then we arrived , at our jungle paradise . Jungle huts planted on the shore of the river . No neighbours in sight . Our tight-knit group , guides and cooks were the only inhabitants . After having acclimatized with our new jungle home , we were back in the canoe and soaring along the Amazon River once again , this time for a spot of piranha fishing .

His technique : shine a torch into the eyes of the young caiman hypnotising the croc , raise above it like a cobra eyeing up its prey and pounce on the reptile like a wild , Amazon jaguar . A chaotic frenzy of splashes and a few moments later , the caiman was in the canoe .

Rather than our cosy jungle huts we had chosen to spend the night deeper in the jungle , sleeping in simple hammocks .

So what are you waiting for ? Bag up your camera , grab your waterproof and prepare for an unscheduled shower ! Take it from us : this is truly an awesome site and if you 're going to do just one thing in Argentina , this should be it . <h> Buenos Aires <p> Buenos Aires , Argentina 's diverse capital , is alive with colour , history and culture , a sprawling metropolis where you can tuck into the country 's juiciest steaks and sip on its finest wines . The 48 barrios ( districts ) that make up the city include the colonial San Telmo and the brightly coloured La Boca , featured on many a postcard , both well worth a few hours wandering . But you simply ca n't visit Buenos Aires without catching a tango show of some kind . Whether it is an energetic street performance or a dinner show at a hotel or a theatre , it 's an impressive and evocative display of dance and expression . <h> Mendoza <p> Mendoza is pleasant enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producers of Argentina 's world-renowned Malbec . The city has wine tours coming out of its ears , varying from cheap and cheerful tastings just outside town to longer , full-day excursions to the Uco Valley with a gourmet lunch included . Further afield , the snow-capped peaks of the Andes are easily visited on a tour from Mendoza , many of which take you to the base of Cerro Aconcagua , America 's highest mountain at 6,962m . <h> Bariloche <p> At the foot of the Andes , surrounded by lakes , Bariloche is a scenery lover 's dream . The town itself is reminiscent of a Swiss Alpine village , with a quaint main square , plenty of fondue restaurants and chocolate shops , and even a friendly St Bernard that likes to pose for photos . But for the best vistas you should head to the impossibly pretty mountains of Cerro Campanario , the creaking glaciers of Nahuel Huapi National Park and the glassy lakes of Llao Llao National Park , all easily reached from town . They do n't call this area Argentina 's Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as el fin del mundo ' , or the end of the world ' , as there 's no larger settlement between here and Antarctica , just 700 miles further south . Ushuaia is bursting with attractions , the best of which is Tierra del Fuego , an archipelago of twinkling blue seas , thick forests and snowy mountains . There 's wildlife aplenty , including grey foxes , condors and even a beaver colony , introduced from North America in the 1940s . Other highlights include cruises on the Beagle Channel , where you might see sea lions ( and if you 're lucky , whales and dolphins ) and trips to the nearby colony of gentoo and Magellanic penguins . And do not leave town without trying the freshly-caught king crab . It 's delicious ! 
@@9537828 @2737828/ <h> Top 5 Things to Do in Botswana <p> Featured destinations : Botswana , Chobe National Park <p> Published 11 April 2016 <p> Nick Hobbs <p> Diamonds , cattle and wildlife : Botswana knows what it 's good at . Using these assets wisely , the country has developed into a beacon of African economic , social and political stability since gaining its independence in the mid-1960s . The economic wealth that diamonds have created for the country , coupled with it being situated in one of the most sparsely populated regions on the planet , has meant that Botswana has succeeded admirably in protecting its wildlife and wilderness areas . With just under 40% of the country set aside either as national park , game reserve or wildlife management area , this is a vast land of wide-open , semi-arid desert where huge skies blanket a rich diversity of landscapes and a plethora of wildlife experiences . <p> From the shimmering floodplains of the Okavango Delta to the flat , moonlike landscape of the Kalahari Salt Pans , Botswana can keep you entertained for weeks . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer : <h> Camp under canvas in the Okavango Delta <p> In the far north , the waters of the Okavango River spill into Botswana from the highlands of Angola , never to reach the sea but instead fanning out and creating the Okavango Delta . The ocean 's loss is Botswana 's gain though , and before the floodwaters evaporate away under the blazing African sun they deposit rich , life-giving silt and help to replenish one of the world 's last pristine wilderness areas . Wildlife abounds here and one of the best ways to experience it is on a mobile safari . This is camping at its finest : a fully catered safari led by an expert guide spending a few nights in one area before the whole camp is packed up and moved on to the next . Sleeping under canvas is an experience like no other , there are no fences here and being at ground level with just a mesh window separating you from any nocturnal visitors is an exhilarating experience . Fly between campsites in a light aircraft , or take things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular perspectives of the Okavango Delta , which was designated the 1000th UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014 . <h> Walk with elephants <p> In the southeast of the Okavango Delta live Jabu , Thembe and Marula , three semi-habituated orphaned elephants . Accompanied by their surrogate human parents , Doug and Sandi Groves , it 's possible to spend a fascinating morning walking with the trio as they go about their daily business . Far from anything contrived and circus-like , the chance to spend some time with these massive creatures and to learn about them from people who clearly care so much for their welfare is not to be missed . If one elephant interaction is n't enough for you , consider a visit to the ultra-luxurious Abu Camp too . Here there is the chance to not only walk with the elephants but to sleep out under the stars on a specially designed deck , overlooking the elephant enclosure below where the family are put to bed at night . <h> Take a boat ride on the Chobe River <p> As the international boundary between Namibia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some serious conflict in the past .

Taking a boat ride on the Chobe River is the very best way to see game during a visit here . <p> It 's not unheard of to see in excess of a thousand elephants coming down to drink along its banks in the height of the dry season . Similarly , healthy herds of buffalo , prowling lion , packs of excited wild dog and rare antelope such as sable can also be seen as the temperatures cool in the late afternoon and animals emerge from the bush , almost as if on cue , and begin to move to the water 's edge . <h> Explore Tsodilo Hills <p> Another World Heritage Site , Tsodilo Hills confounds those who say that Botswana is only a wildlife destination .

A visit to the Tsodilo Hills accompanied by a local guide opens up a fascinating and altogether different aspect of Botswana which few visitors to the country take the time to explore . <h> Quad Bike across the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans <p> If the Okavango Delta is an oasis of life in the heart of the arid Kalahari Desert then it would be easy to view the salt pans of the Makgadikgadi as its counter point . Sparse , vast and flat these dry plains of white nothingness are just as beautiful for their scale and emptiness as the Delta is for its intricate landscapes . The feeling of freedom and isolation is what attracts visitors to the pans and there is no better way to experience this than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon so extensive that you can see the curvature of the Earth . <p> Led by an experienced guide , you 'll head for Kubu Island , a rare outcrop which rises from the landscape . This is where you 'll set up camp and begin exploring the local area . Beads and tools used by traders and Bushmen passing through the area hundreds and even thousands of years ago can still be found all around . If the scale of the pans and the evidence of generations of previous visitors to this site is n't awe inspiring enough for you then just wait until the sun goes down and the night begins . Sleeping under a sky full of stars your guide will point out all of the visible constellations and planets and the feeling of total isolation is truly complete . <p> If you fancy heading for Botswana , check out Round the World Experts ' Southern African Predators Journey , which includes a stay in Chobe National Park .

Most visitors will arrive into or depart from the city , and it 's worth spending a few days exploring the sights and sampling the local lifestyle before moving on . Here 's our guide to the top 7 things to do in the city : <h> Have a picnic in Kings Park <p> With fabulous city and Swan River views , Kings Park is a delightful place to while away a sunny day especially if you bring a picnic to eat on the lush lawns . The park 's network of pathways showcases various plants native to Western Australia , and there 's also an impressive war memorial ( pictured ) . Within the grounds you 'll also find the Western Australian Botanic Garden , home to over 12,000 species , including the magnificent wildflowers that bloom colourfully in the springtime . Hidden amongst the trees you 'll also find various statues , a water garden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia 's flora and fauna . <h> Cruise the Swan River <p> The Swan River flows steadily from the Avon River , right through Perth , and all the way to the Indian Ocean at Fremantle . With many of the city sights visible from the water , as well as the peaceful riverside views , the banks make a great spot for a walk of a cycle ride . The best way to explore is by boat though , with the summer months lending themselves well to canoeing or kayaking . For something less strenuous , scenic cruises are available , some including gourmet lunches and wine tasting and some heading all the way to Fremantle . Cruise the river at night for a whole new perspective on the city 's lights . <h> Browse the Museums <p> If museums are your bag , then Perth 's the place to come . The Perth Mint is the stand-out favourite , having been established in 1899 and still producing coins today . Take a tour , learn about the production of coins and see liquid gold being made into gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about the state 's wildlife and Aboriginal History , while in Perth 's northern suburbs the Aquarium of Western Australia is a good option for families ; come to admire its jellyfish , turtles and starfish , and see if you can find Nemo .

Far removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown Perth , Rottnest Island 's pretty coves , soft sandy beaches and coastal walking paths are the perfect escape " come for the day or stay for a week !

Fremantle is a chilled-out place that stops long and often " for coffee on the Cappuccino Strip ' , for craft beer at the Little Creatures Brewery and for fresh seafood by the water . The Arts Centre , historic convict prison and bustling 150-stall market will vie with the beach and the harbourside fish and chip shops for your time .

Perth is the perfect place to do just that , with the much-loved bronze kangaroo sculptures found on St George 's Terrace , with one even drinking ' from the adjacent fountain . But for the real deal , try Whiteman Park in the north of the city , where they roam freely , or Pinnaroo Valley Memorial Park , where the resident roos are used to humans , allowing you to get pretty close .

@@9537844 @2737844/ <h> Sleeping in the Thai Jungle with Elephant Hills <p> In the heart of the jungle , Thailand 's Elephant Hills camp has become a new ecotourism playground for the responsible animal lover . Like many tour companies in the country , Elephant Hills has listened to the growing concerns of visitors , reshaping their game plan and putting the environment and native creatures ' welfare at the top of the priority list . This was why I chose to spend three days exploring the jungle and wildlife here , not as a destructive tourist , but as a welcomed guest . <p> The Elephant Hills camp is found in the heart of Southern Thailand 's largest stretch of primary rainforest in the Khao Sok National Park . After travelling from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok I checked into one of the luxury tents at the Elephant Hills Tented Camp . <p> Kitted out with a double bed , a hot water shower and even your own tea and coffee stash , it is a world away from the traditional camping experience , giving you a taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural wonders of the jungle . <p> Waking to the sounds of wild monkeys swinging overhead , it was time to meet the celebrated residents , the Asian elephant . Most of us will probably have seen an elephant in real life , but there 's nothing like being able to stand close enough to give them a bath , and feed them their sugar cane , bamboo and fruit for dinner . My heart was well and truly stolen by Haha , the baby of the group who had a cheeky habit of stepping on the hose to soak her trainer while he was trying to give her a shower . <p> Although many visitors are attracted to the camp for the elephants , by no means is that where the adventure ends . Our first day was completed with canoeing down the Sok river with some amazing views and in the evenings , we were kept busy with authentic Thai cooking classes and performances from local schools , which gave me a real flavour of traditional Thai culture . <p> Day two brought a trip to the rainforest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local market in Takhun . A far cry from the tourist laden markets of Bangkok , Takhun is filled with local produce being selected frantically by locals rounding up ingredients for that night 's meal . <p> Rows of tents floating peacefully on Cheow Lan lake greeted me as I arrived at the rainforest camp . I was one of the only ones who was not staying overnight , so while the rest of the group headed off on a jungle trek , I revelled in a peaceful swim in the lake and spent the afternoon spotting wildlife in the dense jungle . My journey back to Elephant camp was in a long tail boat , and sitting up front by myself I was honoured with the most incredible view the orange hues of sunset reflecting in the calm river . A moment that truly reminded me of why I choose to travel . <p> My memorable trip was finished off with an early morning jungle trek .

@@9537845 @2737845/ <h> Sailing Halong Bay <p> In this post travel blogger Jayne Gorman tells us about her experience sailing the beautiful Halong Bay in Vietnam . The limestone karsts jutting from the emerald waters of the South China Sea are one of the most extraordinary sights in the world and certainly the highlight of Vietnam . Read on to find out why sailing Halong Bay is such an unforgettable experience <p> Halong Bay was made for featuring on brochure covers and postcards . Literally looking like a magical land where dinosaurs and dragons could happily play , it had long been on my bucket list to make a visit . Wanting to be able to take a closer look of the area but not be too far from the creature comforts I enjoy , I arranged to join a two-day Halong Bay Junk Cruise with Intrepid Travel . This was definitely the right thing to do " our private wood panelled room came with a duvet covered double bed , electric heater and en suite bathroom " so much style and comfort in such a little space . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where students on bicycles race the bus , and around motorbikes with cows on the back . <p> The tour got off to a very smooth start . When we arrived at our hotel in Hanoi the evening before , a welcome pack from Intrepid was waiting for us with details of the trip ahead . There was also a reminder to pack our passports ( this is very important " the port authority need to see them before you can board a boat and if you leave them at your hotel 4 hours away this is a problem , as some people on our bus discovered ! ) Our hotel , the Hanoi Elite , was superb . The staff reminded us to take our passports and once we had packed up our luggage we left it behind in the hotel room to be looked after while we were away . We took just a small bag each with some extra layers and toiletries and this was all we needed . <p> Halong City is about a 4-hour drive away from Hanoi . The journey takes you through rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus , and around motorbikes with cows on the back . The bus breaks up the journey with a toilet stop at a service station ( which has free Wi-Fi by the way ! ) but I found the scenery so fascinating the journey passed in no time . <p> At the port we were guided into a restaurant to wait with several other busloads of backpackers and tourists . Our guide took our passports and hurried off to sort out what boat we would be boarding . In the distance I could just make out the first of the dramatic limestone cliffs interspersed with traditional white junk ships . Our group was guided onto a tender boat and we set off to find the vessel that would be our home for the next two days . <p> Immediately after boarding we were guided to the warmth of the dining room for a briefing and the room allocation . The traditional junk ships hold just 16 passengers max so there were only 7 other couples on board for us to get to know ; some Aussies ( of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples from Vietnam and Korea . The group made introductions over lunch and tucked into the first of many local dishes we were to enjoy over the next 2 days . I 'm a bit of a fussy eater in the sense that I like to know what I am eating and had struggled with this in Vietnam . For each meal a menu on the table spelt out clearly what we were about to eat , with both it 's local name and an English explanation , and for the first time I started enjoying eating Vietnamese food in Vietnam . Alcoholic drinks are charged extra but the bar man keeps a note of how many Hanoi beers you consume and you pay just before leaving the boat . <p> Our next stop was at Surprise Cave ; the surprise being that it is absolutely massive ! <p> The route of your boat and order in which you do the activities in the bay depends on the decision of your guide . He will take into account factors such as the weather and visibility , as well as what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Visiting in January meant it was very cold up on deck and visibility was a little poor in some areas ( although it gave the whole area a magical , mystical appearance ) . Our guide decided that we would do all the main sightseeing on the first day as it was due to get even colder the following day . <p> The first thing we did was hop on a little non-motorised boat and float through a low ceilinged cave . On the other side was a quiet inlet where some tiny monkeys were swinging through the trees . My eye , however , was caught by the floating sweet shop . For in the middle of the water , far away from shore , there was a lady rowing around with a boat full of junk food and booze . It was surreal to say the least . <p> Our next stop was at Surprise Cave ; the surprise being that it is absolutely massive ! As we walked through the cave our guide pointed out shapes in the rock formations which resembled different people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way up through the cave and the best bit for me was coming outside again at the top to get a beautiful aerial view of the bay . <p> The next activity on the agenda was kayaking . I held back on the boat , afraid and unwilling to get wet in such cold temperatures , but when it looked like everyone else in our group ( including many of the older generation ) were going to take part , I thought I had better man up . And it was worth it . Rowing our own kayak meant we could get much closer to some of the fishing villages I had been peering at from the junk boat . Fisherman and their families have set up floating villages in little clusters around the gorgeous green bay . We could see dogs running around the planks and there was a schoolroom in one hut . Rowing even closer we discovered we could hear the unmistakeable beat of Gangnam Style blasting from one of the homes " that song really is everywhere . <p> When I opened the curtains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks poking out through the water , right outside our window . <p> Proud to have made it back to the boat without capsizing we joined the other guests for some beers on the top deck . In summer , the crew explained , all the boats play music and the top deck turns into a dance floor . We braved the cold just long enough to watch the sunset and then went back inside for the evening entertainment . Tonight we will be showing a movie ' , we were told , named Top Gear Vietnam Special . Brilliant ! <p> After several courses of fresh seafood and sweet and sour chicken I fell asleep to the sound of the engine 's gentle hum . The boat barely moved in the night and when I opened the curtains in the morning it was a surprise to see those phenomenal rocks poking out through the water , right outside our window . <p> After all the action from the day before , our second day was about cruising . We looped around another part of the bay and I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ogled at in brochures for so long . Just before lunch we were called back inside to help out ; we were to be making the Vietnamese Spring rolls . Some of us had more success than others at rolling them up but they all tasted great in the end . <p> Lunch was served back in the harbour whilst we waited for a tender to take us back to shore . The minibuses were already parked up to take us back to Hanoi that afternoon . For us that was the end of our time being well guided and fed by Intrepid because we had a flight to catch but for many of the group it was just the start on their southbound Vietnam adventure ( the tour continues to Ho Chi Mihn city via Hue and Hoi An ) . <p> Sailing around Halong Bay was one of the main reasons I was so keen to visit Vietnam and it certainly did n't disappoint . The whole area really is as breath taking and unforgettable as you imagine it will be .

This eastern province of Malaysia is in the far north of the enormous island of Borneo . The vast , impenetrable rainforests are home to unique species of wildlife found nowhere else on the planet , while the coastal waters are brimming with an abundance of aquatic sea life and coral reefs . Sabah is the destination for jungle trekking , for scuba diving and snorkelling , for spending lazy days in paradise on golden beaches and for gorging on unbelievably delicious Asian food . <h> Orangutans <p> Sabah is one of the last remaining places to see the orangutan . These intriguingly human-like apes are found in only two regions of the world " Borneo and nearby Sumatra . ' Orangutan ' translates from the Malay language as ' forest man ' , and these tree dwellers share 97% of the same DNA as human beings . Unfortunately , this has n't stopped these elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction . <p> Sepilok is the best spot to really get up close to these playful apes . The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah has been working tirelessly for decades to care for and eventually release orphaned orangutans into the wild .

Kota Kinabalu 's nightly , fresh fish market is a culinary fishy feast for all you seafood connoisseurs . It was my favourite spot in Sabah to just gorge ! The local guys will barbecue up whatever you choose from their huge array of catch " anything from snapper to tiger prawns " and all at ridiculously good prices . I opted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spicy sauce while I drank an ice cold beer on the seafront . <p> Night market in Sabah image : Richard Collett <h> All the other food <p> If seafood is n't your thing , then never fear , because Sabah offers literally everything in terms of cuisine . And in my opinion it 's all glorious ! For breakfast you can enjoy a plate of steaming , fresh Chinese buns , filled with anything from barbecue pork to lamb curry , then for lunch why not try a plate of the signature nasi goreng ayam , that 's the Malay favourite of chicken fried rice , before heading out for an Indian-influenced tandoori chicken for dinner . Sabah truly has one of the most diverse culinary scenes in the world . <p> An island in Kota Kinabalu Marine Park image : Richard Collett <h> The islands <p> The islands around Kota Kinabalu , Sabah 's big city , ' are a beautifully preserved marine national park .

The sea life is abundant and if you 're there in the right season , you can even dive with the humongous whale shark . <p> Sabah 's jungle image : Richard Collett <h> The jungle <p> Borneo is the place to see the jungle . Well , technically it 's the rainforest , but it 's as jungle as jungle can be .

The only problem is that most people add it on to the end of their itinerary and do n't allow themselves more than a couple of days here . I 'm lucky enough to get there often and can offer these tips on how best to spend 48 hours in Livingstone . <p> Dawn at Victoria Fallsimage : Dawn Jorgensen <h> See the great Victoria Falls <p> Start with a visit to the iconic Victoria Falls or Mosi-oa-Tunya - the Smoke that Thunders , as it is aptly known .

There is nothing commercial about this place where traders display their fine fare , dried fish , live chickens and mopane worms for sale . There are stands selling irresistibly gorgeous African fabrics and generator-run fridges offering ice-cold sodas . The more tourist-focused Maramba and Salaula markets are also well worth a visit and sell everything from curios and wooden carvings to second-hand clothes and African cloth .

@@9537850 @2737850/ <h> Cambodia : Beyond Angkor Wat <p> The temples of Angkor are the number one tourist attraction in Cambodia . In fact , according to Lonely Planet , they 're the number one tourist attraction in the entire world . To go to Cambodia and not see the crumbling ruins of Angkor Wat would be a travesty , so I 'm not in any way suggesting you miss them out . Instead , step away from the temple-obsessed masses and linger longer in this fascinating country . Beyond the wats you 'll find plenty of historic sights , natural wonders , rare wildlife , and a sizzling cuisine to boot , as I discovered on a recent holiday . <p> Amok <h> Trying the food <p> When I travel I 'm all about the food . I love to see the sights too of course , but the food is where you can gain a greater insight into a culture , and broaden your taste horizons at the same time . So naturally , on arrival into Phnom Penh , Cambodia 's capital , my boyfriend David and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menu was amok , a traditional Khmer fish curry made with lemongrass and shrimp paste , giving it a mildly pink colour . Its lively , complex flavours , unfamiliar to our western palates , meant it soon became our go-to dish . Amok goes especially well with a locally-brewed beer , which I was amused to see the Cambodians have named Angkor . And very refreshing it was too . <p> Angela at the Royal Palace image : Angela Griffin <h> Phnom Penh 's Royal Palace <p> Phnom Penh is more relaxed than I expected . The wide streets and tree-lined boulevards , as well as the ( Mekong ) riverside location , probably help too , and I found the whole place blissfully crowd-free . Our first port of call was the Royal Palace and its accompanying Silver Pagoda , both ridiculously ornate and jewel-encrusted , and particularly fetching as they glittered in the bright sunlight . The Silver Pagoda , inlaid with five tons of silver , houses the Emerald Buddha statue , which is not made of emerald but Baccarat crystal , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of wealth . <p> A cell in S-21 <h> The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek <p> Sadly , Phnom Penh is not all gilded palaces and breezy riverside strolls . The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum was one of the most harrowing places I 've ever been to . But let me start with a bit of history : from 1975 to 1979 Cambodia was controlled by the Khmer Rouge , an oppressive group whose regime caused the deaths of up to two million people , around a quarter of the population at the time . The Khmer Rouge used Tuol Sleng , a former high school , as a prison , and renamed it S-21 . An estimated 17,000 people were imprisoned , tortured and killed here . When S-21 was discovered by the invading Vietnamese Army in 1979 , they found 14 bodies on-site , as well as a mass grave 7.5 miles away at the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek . <p> Tombs at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum image : Angela Griffin <p> The Genocide Museum is not a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic photograph of how the room was discovered , often with pools of blood on the floor . An exhibition displays portraits of the victims , many of whom were children , as well as the grinning guards . Paintings depict the torture methods , which are too gruesome for me to go into here . The horrors of it all brought me to tears , which I am again fighting back as I write . <p> Killing Fields of Choeung Ek <p> We visited the Killing Fields too . Although there was n't a lot to see " just some holes in the ground and a commemorative monument filled with sculls " it was a peaceful , well-kept place , the air filled with the sounds of tweeting birds and the shrieks of children playing at a nearby school , far removed from the terror that once happened there . For some , touring these sites might not be the ideal way to spend their holiday , but I think it 's important that people visit these places , remember the victims and learn from the mistakes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penh , we continued to Battambang . <p> Battambang 's bamboo train image : Angela Griffin <h> Battambang <p> Battambang is best known for its bamboo train , a motorised bamboo platform that travels up and down a single train track . Once used by locals to transport goods , today the train is a quirky tourist attraction . Of course we had to ride it , and were impressed at its speed as it zipped through the countryside . When we met another train coming the other way , the lighter one of the two was emptied , dismantled and removed from the track to let the heavier one past . We met quite a few other trains , one with 20 people on it , so of course being just two and a driver , it was us that had to move . <p> From Siem Reap we visited Beng Mealea , one of Angkor 's furthest away temples . After two hours in a tuk-tuk we arrived to find a crumbled ruin intertwined with tree roots and vines . Because the temple was in such a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost corridors and passageways full of dust . David hummed the Indiana Jones theme tune as we scampered over the rocks and swung from the vines . It felt like a true adventure
