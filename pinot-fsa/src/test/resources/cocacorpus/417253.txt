When I moved to a new area of Charlotte last year , one of the first things I did was search out a new massage therapist . I have always preferred male therapists because I need a really deep touch . And it does n't hurt if he 's easy on the eyes . <p> When I mentioned my preferences to a co-worker , she suggested I try out the nearby strip mall massage joint , and she provided me with the name of the therapist she liked . When I arrived at the spa a few days later , I met him and did a little " thank you ! " in my head to my friend . She had made a great recommendation . <p> Hgalm ( Flickr Creative Commons ) <p> I got naked , as usual , and relaxed on the table . I do n't talk during a massage , and I do n't like my therapists to talk . However , as soon as he walked back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cringed , but it was benign small talk about where we had grown up and where we lived now . He was young and sweet and it was actually nice , for a change , to get to know my therapist . <p> About 20 minutes in , he said very casually that he has been researching the art of vulva massage and that he would love to perfect his technique , if only he could find someone to " practice on . " I paused for a moment and had a " did he just say what I think he did ? " moment . Yes , yes he did , because he went on to discuss in detail how much he enjoyed pleasuring women . He could pleasure women for HOURS , he said . <p> His massages were a bit more , shall we say , sensual , than ones I 've received before . It was in the way he brushed my hair aside , the way he touched my forearm , and the way he stroked my inner thigh . At one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's ok , " he assured me , " We can do whatever we want in here , and no one would ever know ... " Gulp ! <p> I left feeling bewildered - and incredibly turned-on . I wanted to satiate my hunger . The only thing that made sense at the time was to walk next door and dive face-first into a huge juicy hamburger . Licking my lips , I texted my friend : " That was just the most intense hour of foreplay EVER ! " <p> I saw him every couple of weeks for almost a year . Sometimes I would ask him not to talk , but most of the time we would chat throughout the massage . I got a great rub-down coupled with an hour of peering into the mind of a man who spends all his time listening to and touching women . He had a unique perspective from which to talk about women 's needs and what men could do to better please women . <p> He said that women do indeed pay him to give them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first move by asking him to touch their breasts or butt , or sometimes the women literally move his hands to their body parts that need a little extra attention . As to not endanger his day job at the spa , he offers those women at-home appointments . He said that he always gives them a massage , but " if they want to play after , I 'm down for that . " When I asked how much women are willing to pay for such a service , he said " about $200 . " <p> " Why ? " , I said . " Why would women pay for something they can get for free , either from their partner or from some guy they could pick up at a bar ? " Simple . " They trust me , " he said . " They get to know me , they like me , and they feel safe asking me . They know I 'm not going to make anything more of it than what it is . " The married clients come to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus solely on their own pleasure . One woman told him that her husband gives great massages , but she could never relax because it always had to lead to sex . She preferred to pay for a massage and then get sex from the massage therapist - on her terms . <p> The " happy endings " can be from his manual stimulation , from toys , or through intercourse . He is there to please these women and they ask him for things they are too shy to ask of their partners . He is a young , energetic and skilled participant in their encounters . He clearly enjoys his work . <p> If you must ask , no , I have never gotten a happy ending from him . We maintained a purely professional relationship , and I think we 've even managed to become friends . We went out for dinner the other night and talked about sex and relationships for almost three hours . He is newly single , focusing on himself and building his business . He is looking at becoming trained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly therapeutic and healing for many women . <p> How prevalent is this , I wondered . " If you lined up 10 decent looking male massage therapists , how many of them have given happy endings ? " His response ? " Half . And the other half have probably had women make a move on them and they were either too dumb to notice or they ignored it . " <h> Comments ( 19 ) @qwx83907 
@@7080878 @280878/ <h> Tuesday , November 20 , 2012 <p> I 've been making it every year for Thanksgiving at my family 's gathering since I was 13 . That 's a lot of trial and error , folks . It has always turned out very tasty , due to my secret ingredient ( which I 'll share at the end ) . <p> Sometimes it 's come out a bit runny in the middle or the crust gets a little burned . But thanks to the 16 years of pecan pie-making experience I have under my belt , I 'm going to share with you the way to make the best pecan pie you 'll ever eat . <p> Naysayers , hear me out . I use pre-made crusts for years , then I switched to making homemade traditional white flour crusts . But it was two years ago that I whipped up a whole wheat crust , and my dad said , in all seriousness , " I believe this is the best pecan pie you 've ever made . " <p> The only thing I had done differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartier and more rustic looking . I would tout the health benefits , but who am I kidding ? This is pecan pie . We threw health out the window when we begin the next step of the recipe . I 'll give you a few hints . <p> Two words . The first sounds like horn and the second sounds like stirrup . <p> And like I said before ( it bears repeating ) , I 've learned a lot over the past few years about what it takes to get this pie just right . So read the notes . And when you 're done reading them , read them again , just in case . The results will all be worth it when you sink your teeth into sweet , nutty , goodness with an earthy flaky crust . <p> Mix flours , sugar , and salt . Cut in butter using a pastry cutter .

Use the prongs of a fork to press into the rim of the pie crust and create a lined design around the perimeter . <p> THE BEST PECAN PIEThis recipe is made for a deep dish pie crust and pan . The " secret " ingredient is that it uses double the pecan of most pecan recipes . This pie is SO much better when it 's chock full of pecans . <p> NOTES : This is n't absolutely necessary , but for best results use a pie crust shield or simply fashion one out of aluminum foil to cover the outer perimeter of the crust . <p> For best results , make this pie one day ahead of time and set in the fridge over night before serving . This gives the center adequate time to gel before being served . <p> Before serving , place pie in the oven on the " warm " setting or the lowest temperature for 20-30 minutes . <p> Kelly Davis is a blogger , freelance writer , food enthusiast , and native North Carolinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking something delicious in the kitchen , she 's writing , reading , snuggling her dachshund , or plotting her next project .

Yes , my son is a legal adult at 18 and can make his own decisions , but he 's also still in high school . His mother argues that in order to be supportive , we ca n't object to this relationship . I do n't think this is a gay versus straight objection . If I had an 18-year-old heterosexual daughter who was in a relationship with a 31-year-old man , I would have exactly the same concerns and objections .

Something 's usually wrong with the 31-year-old . There are exceptions , of course , and maybe his boyfriend is exceptional maybe he 's not a jerk who pursues naive boys because gay men his own age can see through his shit but the simple fact of his age requires that he be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny than a first boyfriend who was closer to your son 's own age . <p> Finally , OCD , tell your son that you know he 's an adult and free to date whomever he wants .

@@7080884 @280884/ <h> Cotswold Enters the Food Truck Frenzy <h> Friday night lights , redux <p> That 's when the city 's quest to minimize the presence of construction-site taco trucks ran headlong into a newly burgeoning culinary scene among a young , mostly affluent population . Eventually , city ordinances settled into a friendlier attitude , and South End 's Food Truck Friday grew into the requisite hangout for a young crowd looking for a laid-back social scene . <p> Perhaps predictably , once the new tradition got a foothold , Charlotte 's ubiquitous development put an end to it . These days , Fridays find trucks scattered around the city . Sycamore Brewing has inherited the South End scene , while the original Food Truck Friday has moved to a biweekly affair in Plaza Midwood . Several smaller gatherings have popped up around town , from Prosperity Church to Rock Hill , and today food trucks are standard fare at any outdoor event . <p> So do we really need another food truck rally ? For Michael Rosen the answer is a resounding " Yes ! " <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25 of Charlotte 's mobile eateries , Rosen is privy to the pressures on the owners of those businesses . <p> " There was nothing defined last year , " after the dissolution of the South End location , he says . " A lot of the trucks were very unhappy .

" They just did n't do any business . " <p> Michael Rosen <p> Fresh Med is a relatively new food truck that 's made a big splash . The owner , Tyler Lee , is standing ; in the window is Chris Alves , the chef . <p> The latest Cotswold Trucks Food Truck Rally on Providence Road offers a new Friday go-to with a different vibe , tilted more toward families with kids and dogs , Rosen says . Thanks to Trinity Presbyterian Church , customers wo n't be milling about a parking lot or stuck with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grassy areas with trees , " Rosen says . " There are two gated kids ' playgrounds that are right there . We have indoor bathrooms ; we have tons of free parking . " <p> Live music will consist mostly of small duos and trios , keeping the ambience light . <p> To start off , Rosen has 10 trucks confirmed each week through November , with the possibility of adding more as traffic demands . Some will appear every Friday , while others will rotate through . Fans will find familiar names like Papi Queso and Yummi Banh Mi , along with newcomers serving everything from barbeque and soul food to curries and hummus . <p> " They all do extremely good food ; they 've all got that niche , " Rosen says . <p> It was Rosen , along with Casey Brawley , the owner of Carolina Commercial Kitchen , who approached Trinity Presbyterian with the idea of creating a Cotswold food truck event .

Despite DDD 's claims that growing up with two functioning penises was less than amazing , his anatomical anomaly did seem to get him into far more sexual adventures than the average male in his early twenties . DDD reports that he has had double blow jobs with many different partners . He also claims he has used both dicks to simultaneously penetrate both female and male partners . Despite the growing public desire to see his two penises in action , DDD is adamant that he will not do porn or release a sex tape . <p> After the jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter page , @DiphallicDude , and answers to frequently asked questions he posted on his tumblr page , diphallicdude.tumblr.com . <p> Do both dicks work ? Yes , 100% . I can pee out of both and come/ejaculate out of both . <p> How big are they ? The right one is around 3 1/2-4 inches soft ; 7'ish inches hard . The left one is roughly the same soft and 6'ish inches hard . <p> Can you come multiple times ? Yes , whichever one I start with , after I come I can use the other immediately and keep going . Then switch back and keep going . I can go a few hours , having orgasms roughly ever five to 10 minutes . <p> Have you ever penetrated a woman vaginally and anally simultaneously ? Yes , many many times . Also I have put both in the pink and both in the stink . Same for guys . <p> Do straight guys like your cocks as much as you claim ? Yep , at least the ones who 've seen them in person .

You cut something off your body just to satisfy other people and tell me how that goes . <p> Why did n't you get the extra one cut off ? Why ? They both work . I may call the right one my dominant one , but the truth is , the doctors were n't sure which one actually was the dominant one . <p> Do you think having two cocks made you bisexual ? I do n't think so . I 've had two all my life so trying to imagine how I would 've turned out otherwise is tough to do . <p> Do you show it off in public , like in a bathroom or locker room ? No . In bathrooms I use the stall if at all possible . Regardless of what people think , guys do look . It 's denial when guys say no one looks . Some people do . I know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internally control which dick the pee comes out of I have to take both out . <p> Why do n't you do porn ? There is no price tag on my dignity . In that environment you go from being unique to becoming a novelty . I have no desire to exploit myself in that way . When it came to taking photos of my cocks and posting them on the Internet ... I did it because , without them , no one would believe it . Plus , I felt it was worth educating people that this exists and it 's not freakish or unfortunate . <p> How can you date two people ? Does one of them ever get jealous ? How does the sex work ? There 's a special kind of understanding that is required to manage a 3-way relationship . Communication is key , even if you think it might make things difficult . It 's always better to be honest and open because then no one has the chance to assume anything .

However , we satisfy each other and there has yet to be any problems . <p> Some people swear your photos are fake and want you to post video . You said you wo n't post video . So they continue to doubt you have two cocks . How does that make you feel ? It does n't bother me at all . My anatomy requires no one 's belief in it to exist . I have no desire to make videos , my photos are plenty . Besides , what I feel is the most important thing at this point is the message , the knowledge and understanding I hope to inspire .

There are a lot of people ( mostly men ) who believe that having two cocks would make their life great . It did not make mine great . When it was revealed in my last two years of high school , it made life hell . Once I graduated , I went on a rebellious streak and " owned " my cocks . I was very open about it and everywhere I went , I was no longer me . I was the guy with two cocks . Half of the attention was disbelief ( which was accompanied by a demand for proof ) .

Every action would be perceived as motivated by the secret . He would never have had ' down ' time . To be honest , having two cocks does not make up for every single shred of my privacy being obliterated . It does not make up for being judged one way or another . People set up expectations of a person based on what they know . My two cocks are a part of me , they are n't all I am . <p> Why did you go public after all of this time ?

Shit , what 's there to do in Charlotte before 2 a.m. ? " <p> This is one friend 's reaction when told about this article : A hyperbolic statement , to be sure , but hardly a new one . I 've heard it , even thought it , plenty of times . <p> And there does always seem to be something validating this complaint . Most recently , the greedhead 's attempt to drive the Thirsty Beaver out of business . Or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restaurants as nightclubs , meaning they would have to be 400 feet from residential areas . <p> I 've been wrestling with whether or not I want to stay in this city since I got here five-plus years ago . In some ways , I view this assignment as a last-ditch effort to find a reason to stop living one-foot-in , one-foot-out of this place . To fully embrace Charlotte as my city , a city with a soul worth exploring , even after 2 a.m. , if you look hard enough . I wanted to find a city that does n't just have all the props of a real city , but one that actually feels like one , too . <p> ATTEMPT No. 1 <p> On my first-night-out attempt to write this story , I 'm wearing a " KEEP CHARLOTTE BORING " T-shirt . The intention is n't to start conversations , but I know it will . <p> I sit down at a table on the front patio of the Common Market in Plaza Midwood after locating my friend Ruth* , whom I 've agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table asks about my attire . I tell him it 's just a shirt that some guy is selling to raise money for his website of the same name . The site is unimpressive , but I like the shirt . <p> He starts speculating on the guy 's motives , seemingly as a way to indirectly ask about mine . " I bet he 's the type of guy who has a problem with the Peculiar Rabbit . " <p> I do n't know if he is or not , but I know if I read in tomorrow 's paper that the Peculiar Rabbit burned down in an electrical fire , I would n't mind ( provided no one was hurt ) . The Peculiar Rabbit , even before they leased the lot across the street from them and started charging to park , teaches the lesson that sometimes you should be grateful for an abandoned building . You never know what they might turn it into , after all . <p> " Or this front patio , " he continues . " I was talking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one goes on the back patio anymore . They just want to be seen . " <p> " That 's because the back patio is really narrow , " Ruth chimes in . " Plus , it floods when it rains . " <p> " But I could be just as bored in a major city as you are here , " he says . <p> " You could , I suppose , if you really tried , or are yourself boring . " <p> With this , we finally lose him and before I know it , it is 2 a.m. and they are kicking us out . We 've met up with a couple more mutual friends and one , a woman I 've met a handful of times , invites us back to her place . <p> We talk about her upcoming trip to Europe and drink beer . We talk about music and drink more beer . Before I know it , I 'm passed out on the couch . Ruth walks back into the room and nudges me awake , awkwardly informing me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely know , wants to hook up with me , so I should stay . <p> Well , this is n't boring , I think . <p> But I 've been lucky in lust lately , and I 'm tired and drunk and decide that this might not make for a great first sexual impression . I go home , figuring it will keep until she gets back from her trip , if it 's destined . <p> ATTEMPT No. 2 <p> A week or so passes and I 'm at my friends ' house , drinking , smoking pot , trying to come up with something to do . Of course , there are strip clubs and diners , but in either case , that 's just watching drunk people feeding , which gets uninspiring quick . We end up doing nothing until 3 a.m. , when one of them mentions the big apartment complex going up on Monroe . There appears to be no real security , aside from a half-assed fence that does n't even surround the entire site . <p> I had looked in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed it was time to try more random tracks , and what 's more random than climbing around on a construction site like an exuberant little kid ? <p> We 're the loudest urban explorers known to man , and it 's a wonder no one is arresting us . We 're knocking over planks of wood . We 're yelling in the parking deck to hear our voices echo . We 're trying to start generators and bobcats . This is not the proper way to urban explore . <p> I stand on a half-built deck and look out at sleepy Charlotte . <p> " You know , we could n't get away with this in a bigger city , " my friend Rob says while emptying his bladder onto the ground two stories below . <p> " You 're probably right , " I say . <p> There 's the crash of another two-by-four hitting the ground and the cursing of our drunk , clumsy friend behind us . <p> This is one of the better nights I 've had in this city . We probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more people around to rat you out . At the same time , though , we likely would n't have been desperate enough to revert to this in the first place . <p> Boredom creates opportunity . It can also create destruction . <p> Emmins Blythe <p> ATTEMPT No. 3 <p> I used to ride the bus and thus know Charlotte public transportation is appallingly bad . So it 's with empathy that I read my friend Jacob 's Facebook status just before 2 a.m. about missing the last bus . He has an hour-long walk ahead of him , so I pick him up and drive him to his house on the west side . <p> We get to his house around 2:30 a.m . He tells me his roommate is dating a woman in her 50s , so I should n't be alarmed when I see her . This seems odd , but when she opens the door to let us in , I see that she looks closer to her 60s . She 's obviously led a hard life . <p> She moves aside to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his early 20s but is also aging rapidly . He looks like a Blood Sugar Sex Magik-era John Frusciante with a Jonny Greenwood ( Radiohead ) haircut . <p> I 've brought a bottle of wine , but there is n't an opener . The ridiculousness of having a bottle of white wine in these environs , instead of the more appropriate 40 ounce of OE , strikes me and I stifle a laugh . <p> Jacob goes into the kitchen to look for the bottle opener he 's already been told wo n't be there , and the other two follow him . I hear furtive talking as I half-watch the TV . <p> Finally wandering into the kitchen , I see them huddled over something on the counter . What it is only comes into focus through the context clues of what else is sitting on that counter : bent spoons , a belt , a tiny syringe . <p> I almost turn around to leave , but there 's the article to write , and if this is something that people do in Charlotte after 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now rank in the top five cities for black tar heroin then I can consider it research . <p> I look at the table while listening to them talk , taking inventory . <p> Right in front of me is a visitor card from Elevation Church , which has been filled out but obviously not turned in . There 's also an open notebook with the words " Food Stamps " and a phone number scrawled across the top . <p> Jesus Christ , I think , if I was making this up , it would be bad writing . If only . <p> " I do n't think you can do that much , man , " Jacob says . " Put some of that back in the spoon , I do n't want you falling out on me . " <p> I drive home still trying to figure out this city 's post-2 a.m. nightlife . Still trying to figure out this city 's nightlife at all . Still trying to figure out this city , after almost six years of living here . <p> Is it boring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is there anything to do ? Of course . Some of it positively aided by the boredom , some of it negatively so . <p> Either way , I find myself halfway hoping I 'm about done with this city . But if not , I 'll find something else to do in it . All I 'll ever have to do is wait to get properly bored first , and that seems easy enough . <p> * Names in this story have been changed to protect the guilty . <p> Emmins Blythe is a freelance writer living in his adopted for now hometown of Charlotte , after spending time in the Northeast and Midwest .

As a first-time baker , the bf baked up quite the cake . With just a little assistance from me , he piped two-toned flowers all over his vanilla and lemon-curd-filled layer cake and turned it into a hydrangea plant . <p> To achieve the look , he ( ... or we ) tried two different techniques . The first came from the blog I Am Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petal individually . Her flowers are beautiful , ours were not so pretty . ( Check our her tutorial ... she makes it look so easy ! ) <p> After struggling with this method for a bit and creating demented flowers , we switched to a different piping technique . This one , from Glorious Treats , uses a closed star tip to create a flower in one squeeze of the bag . It was much easier and yielded prettier flowers . Use this method if you are going to attempt this cake ! <p> Now that we 've figured it out for you , try making a hydrangea cake for your next occasion .

He would inherit his mother 's home , along with the responsibility of paying it off . <p> Since Parker began banging on his mother 's piano and dancing at talent shows at the age of 4 , he had been chasing the dream of being a performer .

While on the plane , Parker received an email from Creative Loafing informing him that he had won Best Rapper in the upcoming 2013 Best of Charlotte issue . <p> " At that point I realized , I need to keep going , " Parker says now , just two weeks from jetting off to Los Angeles , where by the end of 2017 he 'll release his first full-length album , FREE Mason , under EightyNineTen Music , a record label he signed with earlier this year . <p> Before his departure , Creative Loafing catches up with the artist formerly known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene and why he felt he had to move on . <p> Creative Loafing:You recorded a video for " Run This Town " in 2015 that really showed love to Creative Loafing and shouted out a bunch of folks in Charlotte .

And there 's a reason we delve into news issues important to marginalized communities : people of color , people of different cultures and faiths , people of different gender identities , people who have different ideas about what art and music can be . <p> Creative people . <p> It 's not that we ignore interesting works or issues coming from the dominant culture of straight , white , middle-class Charlotteans . We do n't . But other media outlets handle mainstream arts and issues well . The Charlotte Observer , for example , does a great job of making sure the Panthers and NASCAR stay in the news . They cover the national and international news , and the big touring acts like Paul Simon or Lady Antebellum . You do n't need us to tell you about those things . <p> Creative Loafing arrived in Charlotte in 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention from mainstream sources . We believe avant-garde ideas or issues of importance to marginalized cultures enrich Charlotte , particularly in a time when federal and state lawmakers alike are making life more difficult for our marginalized cultures . <p> Charlotte benefits from creative ideas and creative solutions , and Creative Loafing is here to put a spotlight on those things . <p> We 're also here to question and criticize uncreative ideas that maintain an outdated status quo , particularly when said status quo is bad for certain segments of the community . For instance , we 're here to say " hell no " when lawmakers gerrymander on the basis of blatant racism . And we 're here to praise decisions that uphold creativity and inclusivity decisions like the one made just days ago by the Supreme Court striking down racist gerrymandering in North Carolina . <p> Our previous logo , which emphasized the second part of Creative Loafing 's name , made it appear as though we are more about idle fun . But there was a reason the founders of this paper humorously juxtaposed a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means being innovative and inspired ( creative ) . They wanted to provide you , our readers , with fun and relaxing ways to be innovative , diligent and vigilant all at the same time . <p> This week 's Creative Loafing is a perfect example . Our cover story is about craft beer , an innocent enough topic . After all , having beers with friends is about having fun . But the takeaway from news editor Ryan Pitkin and regular contributor Kia Moore is more substantial than just lounging around and having fun ; it 's also about paying attention to whom we 're lounging around and having fun with . <p> Craft beer is predominantly white . Not intentionally it 's not that craft beer enthusiasts are holding Klan meetings at breweries . Not at all . But oftentimes craft beer culture has unconsciously created an unwelcoming environment for people of color . Creating a more welcoming environment requires conscious creativity , like the events Moore covers in her piece , " Cultivating Black Brew Culture Through Hip-Hop . " When that happens , we all reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can offer . <p> Two craft beer companies Pitkin talks to in " Local Brewers Defy the Lily-White Craft Beer Scene " the black-owned Black Star Line Brewing and Three Spirits Brewery are setting precedents that likely will have a profound impact on how craft beer culture evolves . As one patron of Three Spirits says of walking into the brewery and being greeted by its black owner , " You feel not only at home , but not intimidated from the traditional , dude-bro , ' No soup for you , ' approach to the craft beer scene . " <p> That 's one small step , but a few giant leaps need to be taken . And Creative Loafing will be here to report on them with an eye to both creativity and fun . Because at Creative Loafing , we know that you ca n't have one without the other . <h> Comments @qwx83907

The narrator 's attitude toward her relationship with Sam is expressed through the icy , and isolated , world that they exist in . Beyond this subtle layering , this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into deeper meanings of what is shown on the page . By the story 's ending , one is left with a feeling of loss , which is always a mark of successful writing . <p> The anchor hanging on the wall dropped with a deafening crash as it shattered the glass buffet table beneath it . With her hands still bundled in a scarf , Iris inspected the wreckage . Hanging that anchor had always been a risky choice : Russian roulette of home dTcor . And now it had finally fallen . <p> " It looks like the ice made it too heavy for the hooks , " said Iris . " Damn all this ice . " <p> " I 'll clean it later , " said Sam from his armchair . " I have to clean all this at some point . When the sun rises , it will help melt the ice . I ca n't understand why it 's so much colder in here than past years . " <p> " It 's because we forgot to pay the heat bill . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as we do n't pay for sunlight . But we 've gotten through colder winters than this . I 've never seen the living room become some Siberian taiga . " <p> Iris sat on the barstool in the corner where once a phone had hung from the wall before Sam demanded they stop paying for a landline . The chalkboard they had used to write down phone numbers remained , though a sheet of ice had enveloped it overnight . Iris leaned close to the board as more frost developed , droplet by droplet , making a thick crystal crust over the greenish-black surface . The carpet , the walls , the couch , and even the stool she sat upon had been overcome by the parasitic permafrost . The wool tips of her slippers became damp as ice began to spread to her . She bolted upright . <p> " This is unacceptable , " said Iris . " Call the heat company ... gas company and tell them this is an emergency . " <p> " I tried that already . I sent them a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I would n't be surprised if the mailman has frozen to death on the side of the road . A blue bloated corpse with a bundle of credit card statements clenched in his fist . Crows peck out his eyes and a wolf devours his tongue . He 's half-buried under snow and Ikea catalogues . " <p> " If you were as clever as you were morbid , you 'd have solved this problem by now . " <p> " You want me to fix this ? I have an idea . Get up . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Come here and dance with me . We 'll make heat , warm up this whole house . " Iris grabbed Sam by his thumbs and tried to pull him up , but he would n't budge . His skin felt dead in her grasp like a fish at a market . She let go and ripped the quilt of his lap . <p> " Sam , your legs ! " <p> Where his waist ended , two pillars of ice emerged and curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosted floor . <p> " I 'm fine . It 's actually kind of warm , like being in an igloo . Now give me back my quilt . " <p> " No , this is too much . That ca n't be healthy . " <p> The trashcans outside clattered and banged together . They looked up to see a white mass move past their window . A massive pair of lungs inhaled as a black nose pressed against the window , leaving a round smudge on the glass . <p> " Great , now your yelling has attracted local wildlife , " said Sam . <p> " That 's a polar bear ! They 're not local to New England . " <p> " Give me back my quilt ! " <p> She threw the sheet over his head and checked the locks on the door . She worried the bear would be drawn to the trout in the freezer . She remembered the freezer and how futile that seemed now . It must have been warmer in that enclosed space than in the living room . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ? " she asked Sam . <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> She sat back on the stool and stared at the mess the anchor had made . The mess Sam had made . The mess she had made . She wondered how long the anchor would lay there atop the shattered glass and porcelain . They 'd never adjusted the furniture since they moved into the house together . They 'd never replaced the old heating unit . They 'd never removed the cobwebs . And now the ice . Time had stopped moving ever since they 'd moved in together , ever since they 'd found out that their family could never grow . <p> Iris did n't bother Sam with any more questions . Instead , she stared out the window for hours until the sun fell behind the skyscrapers across the frozen river , the last rays making long red gashes across the bruised sky . <p> She rose from the stool , a thin layer of frost sprinkling from her legs as she walked . She rounded the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance to an igloo . She allowed herself a few tears , but could n't feel anymore come . <p> Besides , they 'd just freeze on my face , she told herself . <p> She pushed his body to one side of the chair and sat next to him politely as though they were strangers sharing a bus seat . She watched the sunlight disappear completely and then saw what she had hoped for . The green and purple ripple of lights shone through the dark . She nudged Sam out of habit , then went back to watching the Aurora Borealis above the darkened cityscape . The breath rose from her mouth in thick plumes as ice entered her lungs . <p> Outside , no cars drove past . <p> 3RD PLACERita 's Last CallBy Candy Rosenbaum <p> Judge 's Comments : This story does an excellent job of creating a world that the reader can quickly enter into .

Maybe the snow would let up , he hoped . <p> The door chimed as Anton entered . Only one other customer was there . Anton politely brushed the snow off himself in the doorway .

" <p> " Oh ... no , I 'm an R.N. " Anton said , as he realized he was still wearing his powder-blue uniform . <p> " Ah ... " the man nodded . <p> Anton 's face still felt frozen and his hands were still numb . Rita returned with some bags of chips . Anton warmed his hands with his breath so he could feel his fingers enough to open a bag . <p> Rita and Anton looked at each other blankly . The old man rushed to the window and looked out . <p> " Sir ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... wait . A bus will pass soon , " the man said , motioning Anton to the window . Sure enough , a city bus loudly trudged down the road . He spun around and pointed at Rita . " You are going to have a heart attack , very , very soon . You wo n't survive . " <p> " What ? ? " Rita said , confused and offended . <p> " Listen , sir , " Anton said calmly . " You 're drunk . That was a pretty cool trick with the bus , but ...

" And with that , the man left the bar abruptly . <p> Rita and Anton both stood stunned . After a few seconds , Rita exhaled . " Well that was weird ... I 'm in perfect health , " she said , trying to reassure herself , but Anton could see she was spooked . Her eyes glazed over . She felt tingly as if she would faint and grabbed the edge of the bar , swaying . <p> Anton sat her down on a chair . He took her pulse , it was slightly elevated but nothing unusual . He got her a drink of water and checked her pupils . She was fine . <p> As the minutes passed , Rita felt better . " Thank you for being here .

It was a heart attack . Anton dialed 911 . <p> The old man painfully chuckled . " Ahhhh , it 's me , not her ... do n't bother , son . " He gasped and smiled , " It 's just my time .

After the overkill of Avengers : Age of Ultron , it was nice to see Marvel return to a comparatively small-scale effort in more ways than one . The diminutive superhero at the center of Ant-Man may not be a marquee name among the masses , but he 's enjoyed a lengthy career in comic form . Created by Stan Lee and co. in 1962 , Ant-Man was the alter ego of scientist Hank Pym a founding member of the Avengers , he was also responsible for accidentally creating the villainous robot Ultron ( obviously , the films stray dramatically from the inked page ) . Others later donned the Ant-Man suit , most notably Scott Lang beginning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads together by positing Pym ( Michael Douglas ) as an older man no longer able to suit up and Lang ( Paul Rudd ) as the younger guy he chooses to succeed him . Pym 's recruitment of Lang is charged with urgency , as he needs someone to assist him in stopping his former protTgTe , the ruthless Darren Cross ( Corey Stoll ) , from discovering the formula , the so-called " Pym particle " that allows a man to shrink to insect size , and selling it to the highest-bidding evildoers . What allows Ant-Man to flourish is that it largely turns its back on the solemnity and self-importance that occasionally hamper Marvel features and instead traffics in the same sort of freewheeling frivolity seen in the previous summer 's smash , Guardians of the Galaxy . For that , thank Rudd , a scene-stealing Michael Pea ( as Lang 's ex-con buddy ) , and the ability of the screenwriters to include witticisms both verbal ( " tales to astonish " is there for the comic fans ) and visual ( love the bug zapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod to Ghostbusters ? ) . <p> Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Rudd and director Peyton Reed ; a making-of featurette ; deleted scenes ; and a gag reel . <p> Movie : *** <p> Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun 2-1/2 : The Smell of Fear ( Photo : Warner ) <p> THE NAKED GUN 2-1/2 : THE SMELL OF FEAR ( 1991 ) / NAKED GUN 33-1/3 : THE FINAL INSULT ( 1994 ) .

The Naked Gun 33-1/3 : The Final Insult is on shakier ground , with the template finally running out of steam . There are still enough gags worth catching , though , with the plot finding Drebin attempting to stop a homegrown terrorist ( Fred Ward ) scheming to blow up the Academy Awards ceremony .

Adapted and directed by Carl Franklin ( three years removed from his breakthrough film , the 1992 indie hit One False Move ) , Devil in a Blue Dress was one of the era 's more successful attempts at a neo-noir , with Washington 's amateur gumshoe subjected to the genre 's established beats : harassment from cops and crooks alike , come-hither looks from potential femmes fatales , and confusing clues that eventually snap into place .

And yet , for all its narrative incoherencies , visual excesses and shifting moods ( it whiplashes between drama and comedy with light-speed abandon ) , the movie works .

The insane Zorg ( a weak Gary Oldman ) opposes her at every turn , but she receives invaluable assistance from Korben Dallas ( Bruce Willis , appropriately gruff ) , a former government agent who now works as a New York cab driver . It 's not exactly a revelation to discover that then-37-year-old writer-director Luc Besson ( La Femme Nikita , Leon : The Professional ) came up with the idea for The Fifth Element when he was 16 , as few creatures on this planet are as familiar with the principles of the science fiction form as teenage boys with overactive imaginations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , the only being with the power to save the planet is a lithe model whose wardrobe chiefly consists of strategically placed strips of masking tape . <p> Blu-ray extras include a trivia track ; a piece on the film 's origins ; a featurette on Jean-Paul Gaultier 's costume designs ; and interviews with Willis , Jovovich and co-stars Chris Tucker ( who plays the fast-talking Ruby Rhod ) and Maiwenn Le Besco ( cast as the blue-skinned opera diva ) . <p> Movie : *** <p> Inside Out ( Photo : Disney/Pixar ) <p> INSIDE OUT ( 2015 ) .

" They sell out quickly , " she notes . <p> Sarathy cheerfully volunteers that opening this 50-seat store last September may not have been the best timing given the economic climate , but the Indian population of the Charlotte region has been growing over the past decade . She estimates that 14,000 Indian ex-pats live in Charlotte and 53,000 live in the area between Columbia and Greensboro . Rajbhog is the exclusive sweet shop in this region . <p> Rajbhog ( loosely translated as an offering to a king ) has as many as 60 varieties of milk-based confections , or mithai , tantalizingly displayed , at eye level for children , in glass cases . One customer , who drove from Columbia for mithai , studied the possibilities , then finally ordered a pound of bundi ladoo , a popular sweet the size of a ping pong ball soaked in a sugar syrup . Ladoo is commonly eaten during the religious celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mithai is not eaten as a dessert , but savored more like a chocolate truffle . They are consumed at various times of the day as well as with afternoon tea . These sweets are the primary ingredients of social rituals : Traditionally , they 're given as a gift from the bride to her husband 's family . <p> In India , each community is known for a special mithai -- thousands of variations are available . Most are made with milk and ghee ( clarified butter ) . Sometimes the milk is boiled until thick enough to be stretched . Other items are made with a flour , like chickpea , which is flavored with cardamom and nuts . In Rajbhog 's display case are a rainbow of treats : green , yellow , orange , pink and white . Some shimmer with silver . Edible ( albeit controversial ) silver , known as varakh , is used to decorate the Bengali " king of the sweets . " Rajbhog 's mithai selection changes seasonally and all are made in New York by the parent company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also offers snacks ( chaats ) and fast food -- Indian street food -- from a variety of regions in Indian . Chaats , unlike many American one-note fast food items , have an Indian sensibility of balance : crisp to soft , tart to sweet , creamy to spicy . One of the best chaats at Rajbhog is the puri . This is a plate of fried spheres , slightly larger than golf balls , packed with a mix of cubed potatoes and onions sprinkled with bite-you-back chilies and spices , and then filled with yogurt , tamarind and mint sauces . The trick is to pop the entire orb into your mouth : You may go through napkins like a 5-year-old with his first sloppy joe . <p> Rajbhog is modestly priced -- even the grocery section . Lunch dishes cost less than $5 while most chaats are under $4 . The highest price point is a two-meat dinner special with roti , rice , and a sweet for $9.99 . Customers order at the counter , but food is delivered to the crowded tables . Customers pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out . <p> Rajbhog 's menu works hard to keep it simple with the usual suspects -- crispy samosas , a whole amalgam of chaats , a serviceable chicken tikka , lamb and chicken curries as well as a vast vegetarian selection -- all designed to evoke the vibrant universe of Indian street food . <p> Know of a restaurant that has opened , closed , or should be reviewed ?

These crooners sagged their jeans and went shirtless , sang countless paeans to " freaking " and generally stuck a fork in the eye of R&amp;B 's tradition of clean-cut romanticism . <p> On this crowded stage of studio gangsters , Shai was the group you could take home to mama . They hailed from the black Ivy League of Howard University , with three of the four original members belonging to the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity . The group 's branding frequently referenced African symbolism , down to the name an ancient Egyptian concept relating to fate or destiny . Marc Gay , Carl Martin , Darnell Van Rensalier and Garfield A. Bright distinguished themselves from the bump-n-grind anthems of Silk et al . with vulnerable lyrics and swelling harmonies . <p> " Had it been not for the hit song on the radio , they would n't have signed us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , being from Howard , we were a risk . " <p> Shai brought adult urban contemporary to a younger demographic , and though the Village Voice 's Robert Christgau castigated their debut album as " too smarmy and too slow , " ... If I Ever Fall in Love swiftly became the soundtrack to many tender come-ons and reluctant break-ups . The group is bound to attract many fans nostalgic for those days , but hopes to see new faces too , at the Feb. 21 performance in the University district , as part of the grand opening festivities of the newest outpost of Red@28 Literary Lounge . <p> " If I Ever Fall in Love , " Shai 's first and biggest hit single , cracked Billboard 's Top 10 . Success came quickly , as did tension . Van Rensalier , a music major , says he was n't surprised by the swiftness of fame . <p> " It 's kind of funny . I just knew I liked " If I Ever Fall in Love " , so I thought it would be a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people would respond . Within a few weeks it got to No. 1 in rotation in D.C. , so I assumed the same thing would happen again . Then , I learned all it took to make a hit . None of us were students of the business . The whole thing happened faster than we were able to get a team together . We kind of self-imploded . " <p> Shai 's light continued with " Comforter " and " Baby I 'm Yours , " both of which also made the pop Top 10 . But follow-up album Right Back At Cha 's " Come with Me , " " I Do n't Wan na Be Alone " and " The Place Where You Belong " saw less movement , and in 1996 the group released its last recording with all four original members . Like any rise-to-riches story , the group splintered amid dwindling success and finger-pointing . Van Rensalier prefers not to name names , but says , " One dude thought he would be the man . He allowed the industry to come between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , that 's why they do that . It 's almost like a manual ; it 's the same story . Every group has one guy who 's that .

' " <p> Those words came from John Grooms , Creative Loafing 's original local editor who set this paper 's swaggering tone and high standards from the beginning . The quote is part of an essay Grooms wrote for the paper 's 20th anniversary issue . This week , CL celebrates 30 . We 're adults now . According to an often-cited aphorism from the 1960s , we can no longer be trusted . <p> But do n't believe that for a second . It 's fake news . <p> Thirty years ago this month , Creative Loafing arrived in the Queen City with a mission that has not changed : Give Charlotte the same intelligent , irreverent , alternative voice to counter that of the city 's mainstream daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing in Atlanta since the early ' 70s . <p> The Charlotte edition of Creative Loafing arrived in the late ' 80s , a time when alt-weeklies had proliferated across the U.S. , offering countercultural narratives to the mainstream-media status quo in a similar style to that of the nation 's original alternative weekly , The Village Voice , in New York . Since the mid- ' 50s , the Voice had been a counter-narrative to The New York Times , covering underground jazz and other adventurous music , film and arts movements , as well as publishing hard-hitting investigative news pieces the mainstream press either ignored or soft-peddled . The ' 60s saw a rise in alt-weeklies nationwide , and in 1978 , 30 of them joined forces to form the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies ( now changed to Newsmedia ) ; by the time CL reached Charlotte , AAN membership had more than doubled , and today it numbers over 100 . <p> Creative Loafing was a resounding success in Charlotte from the get-go , but it did n't come without a fight . CL was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big O quickly put together and launched a fake alternative weekly , BREAK , in an attempt to syphon off the Loafing 's ad revenue and put the paper out of business . Most readers saw through the ruse , though , and BREAK ultimately broke . @qwx83906 <p> Grooms <p> A year after CL 's launch here , Grooms already an associate editor took the reins ( his predecessor had been an editor shipped in from Atlanta ) , and every week for the next 17 years , under Grooms ' astute guidance and ( by all accounts ) mercurial leadership style , the paper churned out hard-hitting reporting and analyses of local government , music , arts and sports in irreverent , often titillating stories you would never , in a million years , see in the daily paper or its pseudo-alternative tabloid . <p> His shoes were tough to fill when I arrived in 2005 for my first go-round as Creative Loafing 's editor . Grooms had set a high bar , not just in terms of what kinds of issues should be covered , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My objective was to maintain his high standards but expand our coverage . The one area where I saw room for improvement was in diversity , particularly in the coverage of the arts and music . That had been a primary goal of mine at previous publications where I 'd served as a top editor , including the music magazines Option and Rolling Stone . <p> At Creative Loafing , my intent was to assemble a staff and stable of freelancers that better reflected the young and creative Charlotte voices of the early 2000s . In addition to the predominantly white journalists mostly writing about predominantly white underground artists and indie rockers , I wanted CL readers to hear from writers coming out of the exploding Latino community ; black journalists writing about black artists and musicians , many of whom came from families that had returned to Charlotte in record numbers as the nation experienced a Great Remigration of African-Americans to the South ; and journalists from the city 's ever-expanding LGBTQ community . @qwx83906 <p> Hargro <p> We made some headway , bringing noted black music journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring more black and Latino freelance reporters and columnists . But it was n't until I left a year later and Carlton Hargro arrived in 2006 that real progress was made . <p> Hargro , CL 's first African-American editor-in-chief , and his assistant editor Kim Lawson ( who would later become the paper 's first Asian-American editor ) , made a radical shift in Creative Loafing 's voice and coverage , laying the foundation for the Loafing you read each week today . And they achieved this during an unprecedented turbulent time for the news industry , in general , and for CL , specifically . ( Read Lawson 's conversation with Hargro about media diversity . ) <p> In 2008 , the rug was pulled from under alt-weeklies not to mention everybody else nationwide when the recession hit . Creative Loafing 's Atlanta flagship went bankrupt and fell into ownership limbo . After I returned in 2012 , the paper went through two different owners , including the SouthComm corporation , whose resources allowed us the opportunity to provide solid coverage of the Democratic National Convention . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I left again two years later , moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where I did a brief stint as editor-in-chief of SF Weekly , and Kim Lawson took the reins . She continued her focus on keeping diverse voices in the CL mix , but pages and staff dwindled , and eventually she moved on , too . When I returned for my third go-round earlier this year , Creative Loafing had come full circle : It was back under independent ownership but with a smaller staff than ever . <p> The upside of all this turbulence is that CL Charlotte 's current staff is as passionate and committed as I 've ever seen it . What 's more , the current owner , Charles Womack , is the company 's first North Carolina-based publisher and he 's equally as passionate about Creative Loafing . <p> It 's comforting to know that CL Charlotte has weathered so many storms over the past 30 years and come out of them with more autonomy than I 've seen at the paper since my first arrival in 2005 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has forced us to do a lot of soul-searching and asking tough questions : What 's Creative Loafing 's primary purpose in Charlotte ? What do we do best ? What can we provide to you that no other media outlet does ? <p> The answers , as I see it : We can cover local news and local arts with intelligence , attitude and depth , and we can leave the national news events and national musicians and artists to the national media . You do n't need CL to tell you about Donald Trump 's ties to Russia . And you do n't need CL to tell you about Snoop Dogg 's latest collaboration or Dawes ' newest album . When those artists come to town ( and they 're coming ) , we may do a blurb on them in the Top 10 Things to Do , but that 's it . <p> Charlotte today generates more than enough local arts , music and news events every day that it would be silly for us to waste valuable time and space on stories about a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter feed . So we wo n't . Our guiding principle today is to keep it local , and we aim to stick to that . We want you to know what 's going in all areas of your community . We may sometimes take you outside of your comfort zone , but we wo n't take you outside of Charlotte . <p> Do I wish we had more internal diversity than we do now . Yes , absolutely . We have not yet mastered total diversity . But we will keep trying . And we will remain committed to keeping a diverse stable of freelance voices who will help ensure that stories and issues do not get lost in our blind spot . And even though the staff at CL today is smaller than ever , we are an enthusiastic , tightly knit team willing to do whatever it takes to get a great paper on the streets and content on the website and social media . <p> A decade ago , in that 20th anniversary issue , John Grooms reflected on CL 's earliest years : " Enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the early , founding days of CL-Charlotte that we were doing something this city needed , " he wrote . " Truth be told , that kind of faith and a dedicated owner can take a new publication a long way . So we persevered , we improvised , we learned , and , well , here we are . " <p> Another truth : That very same kind of faith is why our little staff today is able to celebrate Creative Loafing 's 30 years of nonstop coverage in Charlotte . And the paper 's first local editor deserves more than a little credit for that . After all , it was John Grooms who set the tone . <h> Comments @qwx83907

Clutch hit the stage running thanks to energetic frontman Neil Fallon . Fallon 's vocals were spot-on and the singer commanded attention for the duration of the blues-rock band 's 75-minute set . Primus followed with a 90-minute set of its own and while the alt-rockers extended jams and enthralled fans with a hit-heavy set , the overall performance felt flat . There was a time when the hits were hard to come by as bassist Les Claypool focused on a solo career . These days , with the reunited lineup , even Claypool 's effortless bass playing feels a bit soulless at times . Guitarist Larry LaLonde continues to push the boundaries , but one new song is n't enough to entice longtime fans .

What started out as an indie-rock band called Elonzo some years ago has developed into more of a solo project by that band 's singer/guitarist , Jeremy Davis . Davis still performs solo , but there 's gorgeous musical and lyrical depth when the string band is present .

It 's not always about just being recreational , it 's about connecting people to work and opportunities , and also sustaining a healthier lifestyle . So that 's why it 's needed not just in the Plaza Midwood and not just in the Uptown area , it needs to be everywhere , east , west , north , everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lifetime . Are you just immune to culture shock at this point ? @qwx83906 <p> Dimple Ajmera . Photo by Ryan Pitkin . <p> I 'll say this , I think great things happen when you 're outside of your comfort zone , and I always push myself to work outside of my comfort zone and I think that 's always helped me along the way , whether it 's been getting a scholarship to go to college or it 's networking with folks or even meeting community leaders to understand their true issues . You have to go to places to connect with real people and that means going outside of your comfort zone . You have to meet people where they are , as they say . <p> Although you moved away from L.A. pretty quickly , you went back for college . Is there anything you miss about your time in Cali ? <p> I go visit my folks in California all the time , in fact I was just there for Mother 's Day , and what I miss about California and L.A. in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And also the bike paths , the sidewalks , as a city we have a lot more progress to do to build that type of network . I absolutely miss that , because when I was in L.A. I did n't have a car , I used to walk everywhere . I lived downtown and I walked everywhere . <p> You mentioned the healthier food options . Are you a vegetarian ? <p> I am . So having that variety of options it 's getting better here in fact with a lot of new restaurants coming , like Fern and Crisp . And then there is one in Dilworth . It 's one of the best . There are a lot of options , but I remember when I moved here six years ago , we did n't have all of those options . So with the growth , the opportunities , and the diversity , it 's changing . It 's sort of like a revolution that I see . It 's going to take some time . It does n't happen overnight . <p> Woodlands was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte . Is n't that in your district ? <p> It is in my district and I take great pride in it . In fact , the Becton Park neighborhood right behind it was ranked as the most diverse neighborhood in this city . You know , we always talk about how do we diversify our neighborhoods , well look at east Charlotte . That 's a perfect model that we can create in other parts of our city . <p> Speaking of your district , the obligatory question everyone wants to talk about in District 5 , what 's up at Eastland ? <p> Since I started on council , I 've put a lot of focus on driving the Eastland site forward , and I think we have done tremendous progress over the last four months . In fact , we are winning when it comes to Eastland . When I started we had no activity going on in that site , but just two days ago , we had over 40 development companies here in Charlotte 10 national and the rest local and regional looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've made great strides in that . <p> Also we are bringing a myriad of activities . We brought the circus , which brought over 30,000 people that helped businesses along that corridor . People after leaving the fairs and festivals and the circus , they go out there and create more opportunities for those businesses . Now we are looking at some of the tactical urbanism that we can do , just inexpensive techniques that can create big results , a grassroots movement that is going to create a revolution for the east side ; a catalyst for that side . <p> We are looking at some of the small , medium-sized activities that can bring that excitement back , it 's going to make that site a destination point like it was once . <p> If you grew up in Charlotte , you probably grew up going there . <p> I did . I would ice skate there as a kid . <p> And that 's what I hear from every single resident . " Oh , I used to ice skate there or I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a place of belonging where people felt like this is a place I would go and bring my first date there . I 'm trying to create that same sense of belonging again . <p> What feedback did you get from developers at the recent forum ? <p> Unfortunately , after the forum , we got feedback from the developer community , and some of the feedback was around regulatory challenges . Some of the feedback was around , you 've got this 68 acres of land , it 's really difficult to find one developer that 's going to develop an entire 68 acres , that 's a huge risk . <p> The site is too big . The risk is too high . And if we do that it 's going to gentrify the area . How can we make our residents and our local businesses be part of the process and not gentrify the area ? When we break it down in smaller parcels it creates opportunities for these businesses to invest and they can be part of the catalyst for revolution . <p> Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm committed to doing this , is how do we divide this huge 69 acres into smaller lands ? Smaller parcels create better opportunities for smaller investors who live in the area . <p> There was a hate-crime that occurred in your district about a month ago , in which the owner of Central Market was threatened and his property damaged . I saw you there on the scene . Why did you feel it was important to show up there ? <p> I wanted to make sure that I do justice to my role in city council by serving and being there for people when they are at their most vulnerable . So when the Central Market incident happened , I got a call from one of the community leaders at around 10:30 or so . I talked to the business owner , they put him on the phone , and he was on the verge of moving his business or moving to another state . I said , " Oh , no , no , no , I have to be there . " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department and fire department did an amazing job .

Just a month before that incident happened someone had attacked his employee when he was on his way to work . This a series of events , and he was very vulnerable , so I felt like I had to be there . <p> We sat down and talked and the firefighters and the police officers were there , and they said , " By you giving in , you are giving them more power . " I think after several conversations , he felt that there was a community behind him . That uniqueness does exist in east Charlotte . <p> When that incident happened , a lot of the neighbors came and shopped at that place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the true asset for east Charlotte , is that people feel comfortable with each other regardless of where they come from .

@@7081007 @281007/ <h> Can New C3 Lab Expansion Save the Scene in South End ? <h> For the culture <p> Sure , " cool " is subjective , but it would be hard to argue that the once-hip neighborhood has n't lost a ton of its culture over the last year and a half , mostly to make room for condos , townhomes and office buildings . <p> C3 Lab owner Glen Nocik admitted the changes have left a hole in the cultural scene of South End . <p> " As far as culture and music right now in South End , realistically , what do you have to do ? " he asks . " Breweries ? A couple restaurants and bars ? There 's nothing else . " <p> Nothing else save for C3 Lab , the creative hub that Nocik opened with his wife Maria in April 2015 . Over the last two years , the lab has operated as a coworking space , gallery , art studio , music and event venue and home for the Nociks ' sign business . <p> Now , the couple is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio in west Charlotte , for a bold expansion project that will nearly double the size of the already-massive arts cultivator by the end of 2018 from 25,000 square feet to 45,000 square feet throughout three buildings . <p> The expansion will make C3 Lab one of the biggest art galleries and studios in Charlotte 's history . <p> The team has already begun work on " Phase 2 , " the first stage of expansion , which will involve opening up a 10,000-square-foot gallery , event venue and bar two doors down from the current C3 Lab location . They hope to open that space in September . <p> In February 2018 , they can begin to bring it all together by leasing out another 10,000-square-foot building between the two spaces , which is currently occupied . Thanks to large , rolling doors in each of the buildings , it will eventually be one continuous space that C3 Lab calls home . <p> When asked whether the move is an attempt to fight back against overdevelopment in South End , Barninger and Glen agreed that it 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members of the arts scene that the culture is alive in the neighborhood . <p> " We 've established in South End because we love it . We see everything going on , " Glen said . " I 'm not going to say it 's fighting back , but it 's more of a statement saying , ' You know what , you can do this . You can make something cool out of what 's still here . You do n't have to tear stuff down . ' " <p> In fact , Nocik is hoping the expansion marks the beginning of a transformation , during which Distribution Street , where C3 Lab is located , becomes the epicenter of Charlotte 's newest arts district . <p> " Our goal , our hope is for this whole street to turn into these types of things , so no one touches it . Hopefully people will start following suit . We want people to continue doing these types of things . " @qwx83906 <p> Photo by Ryan Pitkin <p> Sharon Dowell has been working in the C3 Lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the C3 Lab studios have served as a melting pot of mediums , with artists and entrepreneurs of all types working side by side , sharing tips and inspiration . <p> For example , Sharon Dowell is a local artist who works with multiple mediums ( you 've probably seen her United Buddy Bear sculpture outside the library in Uptown ) . Dowell is one of the C3 Lab originals , working in the studios there for most of the two years the Lab has been open . <p> On a recent day , we found Dowell working alongside Karla Sosa , a local paper-cut artist who 's been in the studio for four months . <p> " I really like the community aspect of it . There 's a lot of connection and we help each other everything from business to Karla just showing me how to do this thing on Instagram that I did n't know how to do , to helping me with my art , " Dowell said . " I 'm used to having either my own space or a space with maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me and I was wondering , like , ' I do n't know about sharing a room with so many other people . Will we get along ? ' It 's actually been really great . We all really do get along and help each other . " <p> In contrast , it 's the first experience working in a studio for Sosa , who moved here from her hometown of Merida , Mexico , six years ago . <p> " I like that there are different artists doing different things . You learn from them , " Sosa said . " For example , Sharon and Kathie Roig , a weaver who works in the C3 Lab studios are kind of my mentors . I 'm always asking questions , because they have been doing this for so long , so they have a lot of knowledge about the art business , and I ask questions about composition and just arts stuff . Everybody here is very helpful and nice , so it 's a good vibe . " <p> When Nocik speaks about the importance of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's referencing a key aspect of why it 's so hard to cultivate an arts district and , more importantly , keep that sense of culture alive in the long term . <p> He and Barninger have seen rising rent prices in places like NoDa push out the starving artists that made the neighborhoods cool in the first place . <p> " One of the things that happens , and it happens in every city , is artists move into a neighborhood that 's less desirable , it 's cheaper . They make it cool , people start to flock there , developers come in , development happens , the neighborhood improves , prices go up , and the artists get pushed out , " Barninger says . <p> " They move somewhere else , five to ten years later they have to do it again . It becomes sort of this reinventing the wheel over and over and over again , and I really think that we need to start creating permanent , sustainable artist space in neighborhoods like South End where it 's affordable , you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to feel like you 're going to have to do it again in a couple years . " @qwx83906 <p> Photo by Ryan Pitkin <p> Karla Sosa started working in C3 four months ago . <p> The key to such sustainability is usually ownership , although Barninger and the Nociks will continue to lease their space . All three buildings are owned by the Charlotte-based Vinson Enterprises . <p> Although Vinson management did not want to comment for this story , Glen says he 's in constant talks with ownership and rests assured that he wo n't be pushed out of the space on Distribution Street . <p> " At the beginning , when we first started C3 Lab , that was always in the back of our heads : ' If we 're going to do this , will we be here in five years ? ' " Glen says . " But Vinson are behind us more than we can say right now . They understand our vision and the way they 're supporting us , with the relationship we 've built with them in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're doing with the expansion , that is out of our head , not one ounce of worry , we 're here for a while . " <p> Now that C3 is apparently here to stay , what exactly will the new space look like once it 's finished ? <p> The new building will be used mainly as a gallery and events venue , which will open up the existing building for more affordable studio space for local artists . <p> The new building will also include an applied craft space with a woodshop , a welding room , a metal room and space for printmaking , clay work and other mediums . <p> " It 's about adding more to current studio space but adding more of these things that impact the community as well , " Barninger says . @qwx83906 <p> Photo by Ryan Pitkin <p> Angela Clousher is a painter at C3 Lab . <p> The new building will also include a bar called Alchemy at C3 Lab and a 3,200-square-foot patio that will host a range of activities and events , from outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we 've been figuring out : the sustainability part , how do you do that ? If it 's just artist space , you do n't survive . That model does n't work . So you have to subsidize things with other things . We were doing it here in the early stage with the coworking and things . That helped us pay the bills , " Glen says . <p> " Rent in South End is not cheap , so as we expand our overhead expands , so that 's why now we 're bringing in the bar component . The bar component is going to allow us to continue doing what we 're doing , and in a sense , if you come here and have a drink , have a beer or a bourbon , you 're helping the arts .

He 'll be shutting down Union Shop Studio in June and running his business out of C3 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C3 Lab , compared to average numbers closer to 50 percent around the city .

We 're invested not only emotionally and putting our time in , but we 've put our own money into all of this . We 've done all this out of pocket , " Glen says . <p> Off in a different corner of the C3 Lab warehouse during our recent visit , we came across Ayinde Rivera , known professionally as Ayinde the Drummaker. @qwx83906 <p> Photo by Ryan Pitkin <p> Ayinde Rivera , aka Ayinde the Drummaker , and his wife Anne at C3 Lab . <p> Ayinde has been making his ashiko and djembe drums in the C3 Lab warehouse for about six months . He called it " the most fantastic experience in the world . " <p> " Coming to work every day , I look forward to it . I look forward to all these different ideas and ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You go to one room , you experience one feeling , you go to a different room , you experience a whole different feeling . There 's a variety of muses if you will ; the muse is everywhere you look inside C3 Lab . It 's chock-full , over the brim with inspiration , " Rivera said . <p> " I think the C3 Lab is on the cusp , it 's on the fringe . I do n't see anything else in the entire city of Charlotte that 's anything like this . And I 've been involved in the arts here for well over 50 years , and I 've never seen anything like C3 Lab anywhere in Charlotte , nothing coming close . " <p> Next to Rivera , Angela Clousher was in the midst of work on a painting . Clousher said she began working at C3 Lab just two months ago . She was attracted by the affordability , but has quickly learned the advantages of working in such a diverse space . <p> " I love the fact that it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Everybody 's got a lot of creative energy . Everyone 's working and doing different stuff around you , so that 's kind of cool . If I do n't know how to do something I can always ask somebody else . I 've definitely learned some stuff since I 've come here . " <p> News of the C3 Lab expansion comes at a precarious time for arts around the country , as a recent federal budget proposal from President Donald Trump would cut all funding to the National Endowment of the Arts , which funds the Arts &amp; Science Council locally . <p> " I think in most places the arts scene is a very fragile thing and can be blown up very easily with just a few things happening , " Barninger said . " I feel that way here in Charlotte . Even since I 've moved here , it 's been getting better . There are more things to go do . But by losing grant funding and things like that , it is going to hurt the artists in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about our gallery is we have the opportunity to help these artists because we 're not trying to make money from the gallery . Sales are not going to us . " <p> As has been the case with Union Shop , Nocik has dedicated C3 Lab to showing more experimental pieces and installations , like Chrysalis , a recent exhibit by local artist and performer Lara Americo originally inspired by her photo essay Trans &amp; Queer in the Workplace , which ran in Creative Loafing . Chrysalis included three-dimensional busts done by Americo , a rare medium in local exhibits but one the C3 team would like to showcase more often in the new space . <p> Barninger hopes the dedication to showcasing mediums of all types will inspire the Charlotte arts community and arts consumers to come together and fight for funding in an uncertain future . <p> " We have the opportunity to show some things in there that maybe do n't get shown in some of the other galleries around the city . Hopefully , in a small way , that can push the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " he said . " If there 's demand in the community for arts , you can get funding for arts . That 's what it takes . It takes the entire community to demand funding and demand that there is availability for grants to artists and things like that because they want to see it . " <p> As idealistic as that sounds , Nocik said he 'd like to see it taken one step further . <p> " I think ultimately what we hope happens is we create newer models for everything , " he said . " Everything has been the same for so long ; you have institutions that are funded by the government . Well , what if there are groups of people doing things like this investing or bringing investors in to do these things ? So that 's in a sense changing the model . It 's breaking the traditional way of doing things . I think we need to change that , it 's time that that changed .

@@7081011 @281011/ <h> Chef Donnie Simmons Looks to Create a Culinary Scene From Scratch in Monroe <h> Southeast bound and down <p> In the restaurant industry , a good social media presence can be the difference between life and death . As chef Donnie Simmons learned recently , however , social media can be the difference between actual life and death in certain situations . <p> Simmons says he was sitting alone in his new pizza-and-biscuit shop on Main Street in Monroe a couple weeks before it opened , working on the menu at about 7 a.m. when a man he had never seen before walked in . In an emotional spiel , the man told him he was a fellow recovering addict , and that he followed Simmons on Facebook . The man had been near relapsing , but saw a recent post in which Simmons touted another month of sobriety , as he does every month , and rethought things . <p> " The man started crying and he shook my hand and he said , ' Man , please post every month , because it saved my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and walked out and never told me his name or nothing . I thought , damn , I 'm really touching people . I 'm touching people in every aspect , there it is . " <p> The sort of love Simmons experienced from that stranger one day in April is indicative of why the former Charlotte chef is bringing his talents back to Monroe after two years as executive chef at Zada Jane 's Corner CafT where both years he won Best Chef in Creative Loafing 's Best of Charlotte to implement one of the more bold restaurant initiatives one can attempt : build a culinary scene from scratch . <p> After Crust &amp; Jam , which opens on Friday , May 12 , Simmons plans to open three more restaurants along Main Street in the Union County seat , home to about 35,000 people just southeast of Charlotte on U.S. 74 . He 'll follow up on Crust &amp; Jam with the opening of Franklin &amp; Main , a fine dining restaurant with a menu inspired by Depression-era foods ; Monroe 's first tapas and wine bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large , abandoned yellow house on the corner of Main Street and Morrow Avenue . <p> Simmons ' second restaurant , Franklin &amp; Main , will be named after the intersection at which it sits in downtown Monroe . <p> Monroe has held a special place in Simmons ' heart since he worked at a farm-to-fork restaurant a trending culinary term that he hates and had to leave when the owner shut down shop to focus more on the farm aspect . When the opportunity arose to join on with a pair of investors looking to start a restaurant group in Monroe , he knew it was his chance to return to where he felt most at home . <p> " I went back to Charlotte and I did my thing , but I said , ' You know what , dude ? Monroe just has the love for me . ' They just have the love , " he says . <p> He talked his way from an executive chef offer to becoming an equal third partner with the Ralph Lawrence Group , and now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's time . <p> " My focus now is about giving back to the community , because I do n't know if it 's a community that 's ever been really tapped into or touched from a food aspect . Everybody that I 've talked to personally says , ' We 've been waiting on something . We 've been waiting on it . ' When I said I 'm back in Monroe , everybody said , ' Why did it take so long ? " he says . <p> " So when I came here my mission statement was to look at the farmers , let 's look at the community , and I want to give back 100 percent . I think that 's what we 've stuck to . I 'm telling you , I 'm giving . I tell you 100 percent , I 'm giving . " <p> In the weeks leading up to the official Crust and Jam opening , he 's been taking that mission statement literally . Simmons and the staff there have been handing out pizzas and biscuit sandwiches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through downtown Monroe . <p> When Creative Loafing stopped by the new location and prepared to tour the spots where his next ventures will open later this year , nobody in the shop was disappointed , as folks raved about the pizza . Simmons has also been building up his social media presence with contests and free offers on the Crust and Jam Facebook page , where Monroe residents have shared their excitement about the low-key pizza and biscuit joint . <p> As Simmons walks down a Main Street that will soon be dotted with his own businesses , the Mint Hill native looks more Midwood than Monroe . He 's heavily tattoed and his ever-present dark shades and low-sitting hat block his face . His gauged earlobes flap in the breeze . <p> And yet , older shop owners and young folks alike stop him in the street to discuss the pizza they tried earlier in the day or the tomato jam he 's been handing out to social media winners . It 's clear he 's already ingratiated himself with the folks strolling through town on a lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it was a shock for them , " Simmons says . " Now that I 've come back , I 'm easily recognizable . I do n't look like the stereotypical Union County person , if there 's such a thing . Now when I walk up and down the street , people are like , ' Oh , hey ! ' With the tattoos , I would think it might be different , but I share my story about being sober and I share my story about people that work in my kitchen being recovering addicts . I open my kitchen up to give people second chances , so I think people have accepted me more . They know what I 'm about . " @qwx83906 <p> Donnie Simmons at his first venture , Crust and Jam , which opens on Friday , May 12 , at 12 p.m . <p> Simmons is referring to his " Clean Kitchen " policy , one that he implemented at Zada Jane 's and will keep going at all four of his new restaurants . As a recovering addict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has a zero-tolerance policy for drug use or drinking in the kitchens he runs . He wants to make sure folks like himself who may be struggling with addiction always feel comfortable there . <p> " It was always around . It was everywhere in that industry . Some people want to agree or disagree , but it 's the industry , " he says , talking of the rampant drug use he witnessed while coming up in the culinary industry . " I talk to a lot of people doing what I do and they say , ' You know what , I got out of it because of the overwhelming drug abuse , seeing that shit all day . ' " <p> He says he eventually got clean because he was tired , although a long pause before he tells the story makes it clear that there was more going on at that time seven years ago when he began to turn his life around . <p> " There was an experience , and the experience was I better not ever do it again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day tired . I was physically tired . It 's work to get high . Heroin , opiates , drinking . I think it started with being in the restaurant business . One of the main things was , ' Hey , we get a shift drink . ' You get that and it never stopped . It went from shift drinks to , ' Where are we going afterwards ? ' and after that , just downhill , because I was n't one who could control it . A lot of people can , and I do n't knock it , but a lot of people ca n't . " <p> Around 2015 , deaths from heroin overdoses in Mecklenburg County were skyrocketing , including multiple deaths and overdoses among folks were known to frequent the Plaza Midwood area , where Simmons had taken over the Zada Jane 's kitchen . That and learning the story of a friend who could n't find work after being caught selling marijuana inspired Simmons to try to help , and he decided to implement the Clean Kitchen , hiring ex convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It can mean a clean kitchen physically , or it can mean a clean kitchen where I do n't want people to come in and do drugs , " Simmons explains . " Growing up in this industry , everybody comes in fucked up . They come in , they 're drinking on the job , they 're drinking while they 're working , they 're smoking , they 're doing whatever . I said , ' You know what , I want to create an environment for people to come in and enjoy the craft and enjoy it without having all the bullshit around . ' " <p> When we stopped by on that recent Friday afternoon , a camera crew was set up outside of Crust and Jam as they shot a short documentary about one of Simmons ' employees . It was n't one of his second chances , however , it was more like a first chance . <p> Jake Plue is a 36-year-old man with an intellectual disability who says his job as dishwasher , food packer and helper with anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ever had where he 's allowed to work alone and treated like an adult by his boss . <p> He spoke with CL after wrapping his day of filming with the crew , which is shooting a documentary highlighting three North Carolinians who will benefit from the recently passed NC Achieving a Better Life Experience ( ABLE ) Act , which allows people with disabilities to save and invest money without jeopardizing Medicaid and other programs and supports . <p> He said he appreciates working with Simmons because he does n't handle him with kid gloves , like all of his former bosses . <p> " I like it if somebody comes up to me if you have a problem with me , tell me to my face , I might get mad a little bit , but I like to know , " Plue says . " A lot of times people get upset with me and go back and tell my brother and my sister-in-law . I do n't understand that , you 've got to tell me . Tell me first the problem you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Plue said he 's been anxiously watching the buzz build on Facebook for the official Crust and Jam opening while trying to do his part on his own page to let people know that they should stop by , although he 's not concerned about turnout on Friday . <p> " I 've already seen it on Facebook , " he says of the rave reviews following the Crust and Jam giveaways . " The line is going to wrap around this building , I 'm telling you . " <p> Simmons was once where Plue is now , as he worked his way up through the restaurant industry the hard way , from dishwasher to executive chef and now partner . He said the experience has helped him work with those in the kitchen below him . <p> Anyone with money can go get a degree from Johnston &amp; Wales University and say they 're ready to open a restaurant , but Simmons says he knows what it means to do the grunt work . <p> " I went from dishwasher to prep cook to fry cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way up . I did n't want to be the bitch , so I had to work my way up , " Simmons says . <p> " I think that it showed me every aspect of it . Instead of just pointing at somebody and going , ' Hey man , do this , do that , ' I know their pain . I had to wash dishes . I had to cook French fries for 8 hours . I had to burn 50 pounds of bacon . I 've got scars all over me . They 're tattoos now , but hell , under those are scars . I had to burn myself every fucking day to understand that , and my experience is from doing it . " <p> But before he got burned , he had to learn the basics , and that started at a young age with his grandmother , Betty Ruth Simmons . Betty had a strict rule in her Mint Hill kitchen : you either help or you get out of the way , so Donnie helped . <p> Now , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ode to Betty , now 85 . Many of the recipes at Crust and Jam are n't just inspired by his grandmother , they 're her recipes ; her biscuits and her jam on those biscuits . The Brown Betty Butter is n't her only jam there , she shared with Donnie her way of making fig jam , Chow Chow , even pickled corn . <p> Simmons prepares biscuits with his grandmother 's old recipe . Photo by Hunter Henrickson . <p> In his next restaurant , Franklin &amp; Main , the recipes are inspired by Southern cooking of the 1920s and 1930s . That includes authentic recipes like fried green tomatoes breaded with ground corn flakes , ox tail served in tin foil the way Southerners used to cook it in the ground and hot milk cake . <p> " I really want people to understand where food comes from . One thing that I 've learned is that so many chefs including myself have taken so much food and overcomplicated it just to be different , " Simmons says . " On that Franklin &amp; Main menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing that you do n't know in terms of food : corn flakes , tomatoes , ox tails , pork chops , liver , everything on there , you understand what it is . And you can say , ' Oh man , my grandmother made this , ' or , ' I ate this at my aunt 's house , we had this after church , ' and you can relate to it and understand it . <p> " When I personally go places I say I do n't know what that is and I 've been cooking for 25 years . I do n't want that . I want it to be a story and be able to be easily recognized . " <p> It 's when Simmons gets to talking about food that he becomes the most energized , his raspy voice quickening when he talks about his old-school cooking styles that have just recently become trendy . <p> " My grandmother raised me , I started watching her over the years and learning and doing whatever she did , " he says . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was grandma , and that 's again , the old school Southern food . People now are going , ' Hey man , we 're cooking with cast iron skillets . ' I do n't know what the fuck anything else is but a cast-iron skillet . Let 's keep it 100 . You got a new cast iron skillet ? My shit is from 1978 , literally . " <p> Despite the tattoos , the cockiness of a man who knows he came up in the game the right way and the explicit language of the slickest of city slickers , Simmons feels right at home in this new tired town a town he hopes to wake up . <p> For now , Simmons says he focused strictly on successfully launching these four restaurants and bringing jobs to town , but down the road a bit , he hopes to make Monroe a destination city for foodies . <p> From behind the blacked out glasses , Simmons is always looking at the bigger picture . <p> " I think the way that we did it is smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one little restaurant , I do n't know that it would have been successful , " he says . " But Monroe is a cool little town , just look around . I would love to put it on the map . These small towns nowadays are the ones getting recognized . These towns have to start somewhere , and I think it 's time now that Monroe gets that . " <p> From looking at him , he 's the last one you 'd expect to bring them there , but maybe that 's the type of person this Main Street , Monroe has been waiting for all along . <h> Comments @qwx83907 
@@7081013 @281013/ <h> Meet Your Local Farmers <h> Behind the Booth at the Farmers Market <p> As spring makes its final entrance across our region , a sunny morning at a local farmers market presents an appealing prospect . The image of tables piled high with brightly colored carrots and lettuce draws people from their beds all across the Charlotte area . <p> But those crops do n't pile themselves . Nor do they harvest , clean or transport themselves . No , behind every booth stands a vendor who can tell you the market day starts well before Saturday morning sunrise . <p> Farmers Joe and Dani Rowland have been selling at area markets for about six years , usually splitting up to cover two per week . This year they will enter a third , having just been accepted at Matthews Community Farmers Market . <p> One of their specialties is fresh chicken , meaning their Saturday preparations start on Thursday with poultry processing . That technically means they start Wednesday , when Dani makes her first trip to a local ice plant . <p> " We go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . That 's enough to chill freshly killed birds , with another load on Friday to fill coolers in preparation for hot market days . Fridays are also the prime day for harvesting produce for markets , especially during the spring , " says Dani . <p> " We want things to be as fresh as possible , so we try and wait to pick everything on Friday . So on Saturday we can say ' This was picked 24 hours ago . ' " <p> Harvesting is just the first step , though . Produce is then carefully washed by hand , and in many cases weighed , before being bundled or bagged for market . @qwx83906 <p> Victoria and Zack Gadberry <p> Farmers are n't the only ones starting preparations days ahead . Cheesemaker Zack Gadberry begins building inventory of UAV products on Wednesday or Thursday , and may even find himself making extra mozzarella early Saturday morning to fill last-minute orders . He and wife Victoria have been selling fresh Italian cheeses and cultured butter at Matthews and the regional markets for the past three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , because we did n't have all the products we do now , " says Victoria . " But not anymore . " Nowadays UAV 's lineup of 15 products includes feta and goat cheeses that require several days to brine or age . <p> Even with two days of preparation , Friday is a long one for both businesses , sometimes stretching to 11 p.m. or midnight . No matter how organized their week , the farmers and the cheesemongers often find themselves scrambling to pack a little extra for late orders . The Rowlands have tried to cut their hours back , especially since the arrival of baby Ella last September , but they still stay busy until after 7 p.m . <p> Saturdays start early , around 4 a.m. , for the Rowlands and Gadberrys , regardless of season . Both households experience a fast , Spartan start to the morning . <p> " Shower ? What 's a shower ? " jokes Dani Rowland . " There 's no shower , there 's no breakfast . " The chickens do n't care that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading commences . <p> There are more than ice-packed coolers to sling into the trucks , too . Tables , signs , baskets and other accoutrements come along to create an attractive display that helps drive sales . With lots of grocery store experience , the Rowlands pay particular attention to arranging their merchandise . <p> " Making it look abundant and full and fresh is really important , " says Dani , who says it takes her an hour or more to arrange those eye-catching bunches of carrots and lettuce . And that job does n't finish when the opening bell rings . Not only do piles need restacking as customers browse , but in hot weather , sensitive produce rotates in and out of the coolers . <p> " As people shop , I 'm constantly moving things , " says Joe , confirming that selling means more than chatting with customers and taking their money . " We start with three tables , and by the end of the day we have one little table in the middle . " <p> Courtesy of Rowland 's Row Farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , can be a challenge , especially during the first rush . As lines lengthen , regulars and new customers need equal attention , whether that means remembering to grab an order held back , or explaining how smoked mozzarella is made . Part of the experience of the farmers market is that connection with the producer , and that means extra conversation time is part of the deal . <p> The end of the day goes beyond the last sale of beets or butter . When the Matthews market shuts down at noon , Zack Gadberry packs up and drives over to join Victoria at the Regional Market , where they are required to remain until 2 p.m. , regardless of whether they 've sold out . After closing up and driving home , they usually wind up their day around 4 p.m. 12 hours after they started . <p> Joe and Dani Rowland 's market day usually ends a little earlier , typically finding them back at the farm by 2 p.m . But they still have about four hours of unloading , cleaning , record keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours of a different kind of vegging . " On Saturday night , we 're not having our other farmer friends over for a fiddle session , " Dani says with a laugh . <p> For Zack Gadberry , who works overnight during the week , Sunday is his only down time . " That 's been an adjustment for me , kind of like a chef 's wife , " says Victoria . " In my head , this is our one day together , and I want to go do something . In his head , this is his one day to not do anything . I try to give him that more often than not , because that 's all he gets . " <p> Going over their own Sunday catch-up schedule , Joe Rowland points out that in all their days of market prep , " We have n't done any farming yet . We have n't grown anything . We have n't planted anything . " <p> Yet all the vendors still relish their one day a week seeing customers face-to-face . As Dani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . . . even when we are weeding for hours in 90-degree weather and half our broccoli crop is n't coming up .

The answers are " Yes " and " No . " <p> " Just sitting down and drawing is magic in my eyes , " Shropshire says . " An artist brings something into existence that no one would have ever seen otherwise . That 's magic . " <p> Shropshire is a self-trained artist who started drawing when he was a kid .

" I 've always been very interested in history , and I started reading about Scandinavian runes , " he says . " I like sci-fi and fantasy , and Norse mythology is based on fantasy . <p> " The runes can help people , " he continues . " In Norse mythology , Odin , who is the father of all , found the runes and sacrificed himself to get them to give them to humanity .

The victim told police he had given the suspect his 2000 Honda Accord to sell for him in January , but the suspect had yet to sell it , or so they said . Regardless , the victim gave the same suspect his 2000 Ford F-150 to sell for him in mid-February . By April , one would think the victim would be suspicious , right ? Not quite , as he continued to hand over cars , this time giving him a 2003 Cadillac Escalade to sell . Last week , once the suspect stopped answering all his calls and texts , he decided to file a report for theft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in north Charlotte last week called police after one of his potential customers pulled in and got into a fight with him before he could even get to inspecting . The man told police that the suspect pulled into the station , but before he could spend any money , the inspector tried to do him a favor by warning him that he would n't pass inspection with his windows tinted completely black . This sent the suspect off , and he huffed and puffed and blew the station down . OK , he did n't do that , but he did yell and scream and at one point even physically pushed the inspector down before fleeing the scene in hopes of finding a more lenient station . <p> That Sucks A 22-year-old girl living at an off-campus apartment near UNC Charlotte got into a fight with her roommate over cleaning the apartment last week , except it did n't start the way a fight about such things normally does . According to one roommate , she started an argument with her roommate not because she had been failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum to do so ( which seems like it would be a welcome thing if said roommate was willing to , you know , vacuum ) and during the argument the roommate threw a plastic bucket at her . The two then got to pushing and eventually full-fledge fighting in the living room . The victim apparently suffered scratches to her face but refused treatment from Medic . <p> American Pickers A couple of collectors were the victims of burglaries last week , although one 's stolen goods will have a much bigger potential effect on the safety of society as a whole now that they 're on the black market . The first victim , a 58-year-old woman from south Charlotte , reported that someone broke into her storage shed and stole $1,500 worth of 1930s baseball cards , $750 worth of NASCAR model cars , $500 worth of Hess truck collectibles and $500 worth of old carousel horses .

The suspect ended up making off with two rifles , five handguns and a shotgun . <p> Cougar A 61-year-old woman was picked up in north Charlotte last week on a night when she felt young and free again ... but perhaps too young and free . Police said they responded to a call off of Graham Street at about 10:30 p.m. one night and when they arrived they found the woman walking peacefully down the road with no clothes on . <p> MEDIC ! Sometimes the first responders have to come to the aid of the first responders , and that 's what happened in east Charlotte last week after a man struck the exact type of vehicle that you want around in the event of an accident .

But those were movies , so imagine my surprise when I see the History Channel running trailers for , of all things , a miniseries remake of Roots . <p> How do you bring yourself to contemplate remaking Roots , a miniseries that changed not only television but had an indelible imprint on our history and culture ? I shook my head in disbelief . This for me is another example of mainstream media and Hollywood 's obsession with " slave " narratives . <p> My discomfort for such work started in film school when I was one of the only black students in a film theory class watching of The Birth of a Nation , the notorious 1915 silent film that casts the Klan in a positive light . I got through the film because I needed to reference it as a film theorist but I vowed I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambivalence has stuck with me , although I sometimes still for the purposes of critique allow myself to be subjected to such visuals . <p> But I became almost militant against not allowing another slave narrative to breach my defenses after viewing 12 Years A Slave .

Boy , was I wrong . <p> It took me weeks to shake off the psychological funk that permeated my mind after witnessing the brutality the characters in the film endured , especially the violence inflicted on Lupita Nyong'o . The film left me feeling angry , defeated , disillusioned and off-balance . I felt like I needed to watch a marathon of Disney movies just to get back to center . <p> As I often do while meditating on a subject , I recently queried my social networks for thoughts on whether we really need another version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream media has an agenda to support and produce narratives that show black folks being subservient that reinforce white supremacy . <p> And if you think this is just folks being paranoid , may I direct your attention to a recent Hollywood film , Gods of Egypt . To place the power of visual suggestion to task I viewed the film recently . I " acquired " the film , as I refused to pay and cosign what I already suspected would be a historical and culturally inaccurate hot mess . I was not mistaken . The film depicted the ancient Egyptian Gods as Caucasians ruling over darker subjects . <p> I remember learning about Egypt in school and marveling at how folks talked about it as some fairy tale place , never mentioning that the kingdom inspiring such knowledge , wisdom and cultural advances was indeed in Africa . <p> This blatant rewriting of history is intentional .

I remember what an impact it was seeing how African-Americans lived , endured and survived slavery . <p> A reboot of Roots just supports a running theme of subjugation and conformity to a system of oppression . I believe the obsession with slave narratives and keeping us looking back is an attempt to distract us from real and present challenges . Those challenges include the disparity of violence against black bodies by authority figures and the ugly truth that our system will not protect us or hold people accountable for said violence , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freddie Gray in Baltimore .

@@7081028 @281028/ <h> NBA Commissioner Gives Charlotte a Gift We Do n't Deserve <h> Fool 's Silver <p> That 's the span of time that it took for Charlotte to not only lose an NBA All-Star Game but to then gain one back . <p> And the truth is , it should have stayed gone . <p> Last week , the NBA announced that the 2019 All Star-Game would be held in the Queen City after having the 2017 iteration taken away thanks to the infamous House Bill 2 . <p> So what changed ? Leadership for starters ; Roy Cooper was elected into the Governor 's mansion in Raleigh , and in turn brought in the aptly named House Bill 142 , which does a marginal job to un-ring the bell of HB2 , making the state of North Carolina reasonably palatable for sports businesses to return to . <p> There 's just one small problem : LGBTQ citizens of North Carolina are far less protected than they were before HB2 arrived . <p> You see , what 's lost in all this news about the " HB2 repeal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlotte 's amendment to the nondiscrimination ordinance the one that gave protections to folks in our city based on sexual orientation and gender identity , among other things . <p> In a statement , NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wrote , " While we understand the concerns of those who say the repeal of HB2 did not go far enough , we believe the recent legislation eliminates the most egregious aspects of the prior law . " He continued , " It allows the NBA to work with the leadership of the Hornets organization to apply a set of equality principles to ensure every All-Star event will proceed with open access and anti-discrimination policies . " <p> Commissioner Silver 's statement is an affront to the entire North Carolina LBGTQ community . At best , it suggests that the only time the LGBTQ community in North Carolina will rightfully be treated as a protected class in this state is during a three-day event during February 2019 that they 'll be forced to pay exorbitant sums of money to attend . <p> By now , one can easily become frustrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public when it came time for the All-Star Game in 2017 . Last year , Silver said that HB2 violated the core principles of the league , which include diversity , inclusion fairness and respect for others . <p> But I 'd ask the NBA and the Hornets , have they spoken to those in North Carolina 's LGBTQ community ? Has the NBA seen that House Bill 142 effectively returns transgender people in North Carolina to the status of second-class citizens with few rights and little-to-no protections , where they will remain until December 2020 at the earliest ? <p> It 's those questions that make all this celebration regarding the return of the All-Star Game to Charlotte laughable . The status quo has simply been maintained and extended past the next election cycle . If anything , the NBA chose to wait a year until the stench of HB2 had wafted away and former Governor Pat McCrory was a distant , sickening memory so they could return to business as usual . <p> Lest we forget about Silver 's photo op at last year 's New York Pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Silver was using the community 's struggle for equality as a prop ; a negotiation tool . It 's no different than when a struggling pop artist decides to " discover " a hip-hop sound when their album sales start to sag ( Someone come get Katy Perry ) . <p> Silver 's Pride stunt was simple appropriation of a culture to benefit that person through some form of financial means . <p> In a February op-ed , Governor Cooper wrote that North Carolina needed to show that " We are a state that 's open for business " and that " It 's time to put the partisan barbs aside , roll up our sleeves and repeal House Bill 2 . " Yeah , that 's politician for , " Let 's stop letting this bigotry cost us millions of dollars . " <p> Where my real disappointment lies is with Silver , who 's fluent in the politician verbiage , and who chose business loyalties instead of those core values that the NBA was supposedly founded upon . <p> And now Charlotte has its crown jewel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The half chicken ( $8.99 ) arrives with a calamitous side of rice and a choice of another side including the tasteful , rustically cut Asian Cole slaw . What was not as good were the fish entrTes . The thin cut filets ( these fish dish prices are all under $9.49 ) cook quickly but tend to be overcooked . My second mistake with the fish was not ordering the " topping " on the side .

@@7081049 @281049/ <h> Review of Children 's Theatre of Charlotte 's The Best Christmas Pageant Ever : The Musical <h> Hey , Hey , We 're the Herdmans <p> So the holidays are here , and we all know the live entertainment drill : inevitable revivals of A Christmas Carol , Nutcracker , and The Best Christmas Pageant Ever plus a few fresh novelties to liven the mix . This year , one of the novelties is also one of the inevitables . For while it 's possible to see the customary stage adaptation of Barbara Robinson 's Yuletide favorite at Matthews Playhouse starting on Thursday , Children 's Theatre of Charlotte unveiled the world premiere of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever : The Musical on Black Friday . <p> Robinson adapted her 1971 novel for the Seattle Children 's Theatre in 1982 , and the proliferation of productions across America has arguably made the playscript more beloved than the book . So the team of Jahnna Beecham and Malcolm Hillgartner , adding their lyrics and musical score , did the prudent thing in adapting Robinson 's stage version . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Seattle , a whole generation of parents who saw Best Christmas Pageant onstage as children are bringing their offspring to ImaginOn to see The Musical . Our Children 's Theatre , which has grown to national renown during those intervening years , had to add five performances to the run before opening night a tribute to their prestige as well as the bankable title . <p> Turns out that the Robinsons , the playwright ( who died in 2013 ) and her daughters , were pretty prudent themselves in choosing Beecham and Hillgartner . They seem to know what can be enlarged to musical proportions and how to get the job done . I 'd also say that Best Christmas Pageant is easier to swallow than A Christmas Carol was when it morphed into Scrooge . <p> Big crowd scenes can be magnified most easily from stage to musical dimensions , but A Christmas Carol does n't really abound with them . Scrooge 's workplace and Cratchit 's home are n't bustling places , and London is a cold , lonely and forbidding city until Ebenezer 's reformation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effervesced and choreographed for Scrooge . We 're also more familiar with the older , more entrenched Dickens tale , so tampering is riskier , more jarring . <p> Recognizing that they 're primarily dealing with schoolkids , normal ones in fear of the notorious Herdmans , they make sure to create their biggest scenes when kids congregate , at church for Sunday school , at school during lunchtime , and at their rehearsal hall near the fateful church kitchen . The catastrophic rehearsal scene , causing Rev. Hopkins to cancel the pageant after the Herdman herd has stampeded it , is rockin ' pandemonium . <p> Beecham and Hillgartner are more artful even before that in their depiction of the adult antagonists . What I labeled as the four Old Biddies , when Jill Bloede directed the play for Children 's Theatre in 1995 , are now three parents of Beth and Charlie Bradley 's classmates . Luanne , Connie , and Betty start us off singing " Perfect Little Town , " as beautifully harmonized and sugary as the overdubbing Connie Francis cooing " My Happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rigid director who is usually in charge of the unchanging Christmas pageant year after year . <p> But Armstrong is hospitalized this year , so the vocal trio mobilizes with Helen to convince Grace Bradley , Beth and Charlie 's mom , to take over just before auditions . In the play version , all four women wielded old-fashioned phones in cajoling Grace . A musical allows for more fanciful , comical liberties . By the end of another pop rocker , " Counting on You , " the ladies have circled to the opposite side of McColl Family Theatre from Helen 's bedside to resume their vocal trio assault on Grace at the Bradley home , with the siblings and their father joining in on the hubbub . <p> If the ladies can be more ridiculous now a big if , since Bloede had Alan Poindexter and Sidney Horton crossdressing as two of the hags in ' 95 then the Herdmans can be more fearsome and ferocious to counterbalance them . Augmenting their chaotic energy is the fiendish work of choreographer Ron Chisholm , who keeps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frenetic action . Even Rev. Hopkins must be convinced of their true menace . <p> We are far closer here to believing Beth 's famed opening pronouncement : " The Herdmans were the worst kids in the whole history of the world . " Where Bloede capitalized a bit on the fact that rather entertaining performances could come from kids who might be visibly reluctant to immerse themselves in the full barbarity of a Herdman , current Children 's Theatre artistic director Adam Burke will have no such laxity . <p> As Imogene , the Herdman who takes the role of Virgin Mary by the throat , Carlyn Head is an absolute she-wolf in her howling vocals , and there is only the slightest glint of cuteness in Charli Head as Gladys , the little sister who pounces on the role of Herald Angel . With all of this vocal artillery hurled at her from young and old , Ashley Goodson can be sweet and caring as Grace , but when those moments arrive for reasserting control and conviction , she also unveils a voice of steel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nativity , Grace is a little more amazing than she was in the play version , but I 'm more thankful for the fulminating comic relief from Allison Snow Rhinehart , thwarted each time she issues a demand or insists that the Herdmans must be thrown out of the pageant . As phlegmatic as Rhinehart is , Tiffany Bear as Connie , Olivia Edge as Luanne and Tracie Frank as Luanne are purest plastic , aging Supremes wannabes . <p> Arella Flur is more than satisfying as Beth , but she 's usually upstaged by Bennett Harris as the bullied younger brother or Ryann Losee as the tattletale Alice , who let 's Imogene snatch the role of Mary from her without a struggle . Bobby Tyson 's comic timing is so sharp in the minor role of Mr. Bradley that it 's reassuring to see him get a duet with wife Grace late in the show , and Dan Brusnson is the kindliest , most Christian Rev. Hopkins that I can recall . Among the male Herdmans , Colin Samole as Ralph and Rixey Terry as Leroy impressed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written fully enough . <p> At least not yet . Estimates of the running time that I 've seen in the Children 's Theatre press releases and in their program booklet have ranged from 60 minutes , approximately the length of their 1995 production , to 80 minutes in the current playbill . My clocking of the Sunday matinee at less than 67 minutes suggests that the piece I saw underwent feverish modifications in its final weeks of rehearsal . <p> I point that out for a couple of reasons . It illustrates that Burke and Children 's Theatre , who commissioned this world premiere , have taken significant ownership in intensively shaping the product . It also suggests to me that the process is n't finished , that the 80-minute target that seems more sensible to me might be what we see the next time The Best Christmas Pageant Ever : The Musical opens at ImaginOn . Or even by the time it closes on December 23 . <p> Maybe then I 'll be able to say that this is the best Best Christmas Pageant Ever ever .

It was hours after an event he attended in the venue , and it did n't seem like the beginning of what would be one of his " top three nights of all time . " <p> That is , until he began searching for a way out and came across the dressing room for Homer the Dragon , the Charlotte Knights ' mascot . He spent the next five hours of that Sunday morning carousing around Uptown Charlotte as Homer , posing for pictures and getting free drinks wherever he tore up the dance floor . By Monday , Gillespie was in jail and the story , complete with a mullet in a mugshot , went viral shortly after . <p> Any such fun and fame comes with a hangover , however , and Gillespie said he is now facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account was set up to help his defense , but was quickly taken down by the website .

We started at about 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon . We made it a full lap around the park in about an hour . Then an hour or two into it I was pretty hammered already . <p> I told Mark , " I have to run upstairs and get some food , because I 'm drunk . " I ran upstairs and ate barbecue and that was about the last thing I remember . The event ended at 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at about 12:30 a.m. on Sunday and I 'm at the bottom of a stairwell with no idea where I am . I called Mark , and he said , " Where the fuck are you ? " I said , " Dude , I do n't know . I think I 'm still in the stadium . " <p> He said he was at Hooters , so I told him to stay there . I start walking down the hallway to leave and I look to my right and see the mascot dressing room . I thought , there 's no way this door is unlocked . I turned the handle and it opens right up and there 's the damned costume . <p> So , I suited right up , walked out the door and proceeded to Hooters . I walked right up into Hooters and my buddy did n't even know it was me . I was ragin ' dude . <p> I left Hooters and there was a big line at Tilt next door . I just said , " Yo man , can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I was like , " Dude , You 're not gon na let Homer the fuckin ' mascot into your bar right now ? " Then he said I could go in . There was nobody on the dance floor . I come sliding in and start getting it . I was doing all the moves you always wanted to try but are too embarrassed to . <p> Joe continued around the city , taking parade-like laps around Uptown on a bicycle rickshaw , convincing a CMPD officer he was the real mascot working overtime at 3:30 a.m. and finally taking an Uber home in full costume at 5:30 a.m. after losing track of his friend . <p> What happened on Sunday ? <p> I went down to pick Mark up in a hotel . The suit was in the back of the truck because I wanted to drop it back off at the ballpark . I did n't think anyone was going to be there , and they were n't . I figured I would box it all up and bring it to the team store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you guys are missing something " no harm , no foul . <p> So , that night , I pass out about 9 o clock , wake up and all I hear is someone in my house saying , " Is Mr. Joe Gillespie here ? " I got the suit together and said , " Here it is guys . Nothing 's messed up , there 's no beer stains . The only thing that 's wrong with it is that it smells like shit , but it smelled like shit when I put it on . " <p> What were the police officers ' reactions when the Union County Sheriff 's Office came to get you ? <p> There was four of them and three of them were cool . One dude was a nerd , he was trying to be Mr. Officer .

" <p> The female officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call when she was dispatched until she stepped on the porch and looked in the window and there was Homer 's head sitting on the couch . <p> They were out there taking pictures with it . They said they should n't be laughing , but it was hard not to . <p> Did you expect the story to get as much attention as it did ? <p> No , I did n't expect any of this . I did n't want it to turn into this . <p> Honestly , I was just going to wear it and return it and I figured nobody would know except for my buddies . I think it was Monday that I was coming home from work and I was scrolling through Twitter and I saw my mugshot on WSOC . The headline said something like ' Man breaks into BB&amp;T Ballpark and flees scene wearing costume . ' <p> Man , how did I break in when I was already in there ? It was n't breaking and entering , it was opening and exiting . Someone could 've walked around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did n't break anything . I did n't even scratch the door handle on my way out . <p> Were there any other misconceptions in the news reports ? <p> The breaking into the ballpark thing , and then saying that I fled the scene . I did n't flee anything . I just walked right out of there . <p> Have you heard from old friends and family or made any new friends out of this attention ? <p> My grandma saw it on the news in Ohio . That 's how far this reached . I 've seen articles published about it in Hawaii on Google . One buddy who was an old roommate , we got into a fight and had n't talked since . All the sudden he was calling and texting me like , " Yo man , what the fuck did you do ? " <p> I got like three numbers that night and have added like 20 chicks on Facebook . That 's been a plus . <p> I 'm assuming you 're banned from BB&amp;T Ballpark ? <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supposedly , I was going to be able to talk to them . The officer said I would be able to explain my story to the folks at BB&amp;T . I would love to do that , that 's all I wanted . <p> If I could , I would call Mr. Knight or whoever the person is and talk to him and explain I 'm not a thief . If I was , I would 've stolen valuable stuff . It was just me in the whole building and I stole a mascot . I could 've ransacked the whole place if I were a criminal , but I 'm no thief whatsoever . <p> The police report said you also stole a two-way radio from the dressing room . <p> I got that in case they radioed that the suit was stolen so I could just chime them back and say , " Hey , I have it . Do n't worry , I 'll return it . " <p> The Knights came out pretty good on the whole thing . They hung a large banner welcoming Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yeah , I feel like the Knights got all sorts of good publicity . I would 've loved to play along .

But she did meet up with us to go over some of the Dos ( Always use way less weed than you think you should ) and Don'ts ( Do n't test the product as your cooking it ) of whippin ' up the pot in a Crock-Pot. @qwx83906 <p> The key ingredient to cooking with cannabis is an oil or butter that you make yourself , she says . <p> " The reason that you can eat weed is that the THC attaches itself to a fat or a lipid . You can make any cannabis-infused oil or butter , but you 're looking for something with fat . You 're not going to be able to put it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or butter . " <p> Her way of going about making her favorite oil is to stick anywhere between an eighth and a quarter of an ounce of weed with a cup of coconut oil into a Crock-Pot and letting it cook for anywhere from four to eight hours ( the longer it cooks , the more potent it will be ) . Some folks decarboxylate their trees in the oven before putting them in the pot , and there are different Google-able ways of doing that , but it 's not completely necessary . <p> After the above-mentioned time has passed , she runs the result through a cheese cloth and , voila , the creation of canna oil .

@@7081057 @281057/ <h> Art Chansky discusses Game Changers <h> Coloring the court <p> At a basketball game in February 1969 in Columbia , South Carolina , now-legendary University of North Carolina coach Dean Smith lost his cool completely . <p> It had been a tight game , but Smith could handle that . It was the racial abuse from the crowd that he could n't take . They 'd been cursing and shouting the n-word the whole game , and Smith was stressed . He was about to take a smoke break when a South Carolinian shouted that Charlie Scott , the only black player on the team , was a " baboon . " It drove Smith over the edge and the coach charged into the stands , almost making it to the ignorant fan . It took five people to hold him back . <p> There 's nothing on the same level he can think of , not compared to what Scott experienced as UNC 's first black scholarship athlete in the ' 60s . In his latest book , Game Changers : Dean Smith , Charlie Scott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chansky takes a closer look at those years for Scott , Smith and Chapel Hill itself . Chansky has been writing about UNC basketball since the early ' 80s , but this is his first book that 's more related to social history than sports . On Oct. 19 , the author appears at Park Road Books in support of Game Changers . <p> With all the myths and legends that have since grown around the people involved , Chansky wanted to get at the real complexity of this rocky period : integration was n't coming easily to Chapel Hill , Scott had an impressive college career but was painfully lonely on campus and Smith 's future at UNC was n't even guaranteed . <p> " Mainly I think the story , hopefully dispels several myths about the whole situation , " Chansky says . " One was that Chapel Hill was always this liberal bastion . It really was n't . It 's not even as liberal as people think it is right now . " <p> Though there was a liberal faculty , Chansky explains , sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town itself was fairly conservative and segregated . There was less overt violence if there were lynchings , Chansky 's not aware of them but rather a racist status quo . Segregationists did n't go around boasting about segregation , he continues , but instead gathered in traditionally white conservative groups like the Jaycees . <p> Hugh Morton <p> Rusty Clark , Charlie Scott and Dean Smith . <p> " One myth is that Dean Smith integrated restaurants in Chapel Hill , which that 's the big story about him , and that 's not true at all , " Chansky says . " He went ( to The Pines restaurant ) in ' 59 with a black theology student and Leroy and Agnes Merritt fed him because they did n't want to lose the business of the basketball team , but they never served another black person for five years . " <p> What Smith did , however , was integrate the basketball program . He was continuing family tradition : his father , Alfred Smith , coached the first integrated basketball team in Kansas in 1934 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to Chapel Hill for an assistant coaching position in 1958 . Smith knew exactly what he needed to open the door for minority players : he needed Carolina basketball 's first black scholarship athlete to be a superstar . The idea was n't to tentatively tap away at the color barrier , but to bulldoze right through it . <p> Scott was that player . He was brilliant , resilient and a spectacular player . Chansky remembers watching Scott play : he was simply a superior athlete . " It became a phenomenon in the ACC where he would play way above the rim , and they had all these white guys who could n't even jump , " he says . <p> Scott led the Carolina team to two Final Four appearances , yet he was lonely at UNC . Out of the university 's 13,000 students , Chansky says , only about 50 were African American . Even as a star ball player , he felt isolated on the overwhelmingly white campus . Most of his free time he spent at historically black college North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Morton <p> The team poses with the 1968 NCAA Regional Trophy . <p> " Charlie has days he 's proud of it and other days he 's angry , " Chansky says . Scott opened the gates for other black athletes to come to Carolina , but it was an isolating and exposed position . <p> " I ca n't even pretend to put myself in anybody else 's shoes and know what that feels like , " Chansky says . @qwx83906 <p> Art Chansky <p> As I spoke with Chansky about 1960s Chapel Hill and how much work there is to be done in terms of race and civil rights a thread emerged : 2016 is n't the first time North Carolina lawmakers have dug in their heels and fought social progress . In the ' 60s , the Speaker Ban Law prohibited appearances by " known Communists " at the college ( until 1968 , when the bill was deemed unconstitutional and struck down ) . " The speaker ban was all about free speech and House Bill 2 is all about social rights , " Chansky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were both rushed through the legislature in the darkness of the night . " <p> Because of HB2 , the ACC is pulling neutral site games from North Carolina , including an ACC football championship game that would have been held in Charlotte in December . On a personal level , Chansky had tickets to see Bruce Springsteen earlier this year : he respects the Boss for pulling his date , but laments that he did n't get to see him play . <p> Chansky does n't get it he simply does n't understand what North Carolina lawmakers are trying to accomplish with HB2 , and it does n't gel , in his mind , with the hard work of Dean Smith or the civil rights activists he wrote about in Game Changers . <p> " The speaker ban was around for five years , " Chanksy says .

@@7081091 @281091/ <h> R&amp;B group Shai looks back at 20 years <p> In 1993 , when hip-hop was just beginning its occupation of pop culture , mainstream R&amp;B adapted with bad-boy groups like Jodeci and H-Town . These crooners sagged their jeans and went shirtless , sang countless paeans to " freaking " and generally stuck a fork in the eye of R&amp;B 's tradition of clean-cut romanticism . <p> On this crowded stage of studio gangsters , Shai was the group you could take home to mama . They hailed from the black Ivy League of Howard University , with three of the four original members belonging to the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity . The group 's branding frequently referenced African symbolism , down to the name an ancient Egyptian concept relating to fate or destiny . Marc Gay , Carl Martin , Darnell Van Rensalier and Garfield A. Bright distinguished themselves from the bump-n-grind anthems of Silk et al . with vulnerable lyrics and swelling harmonies . <p> " Had it been not for the hit song on the radio , they would n't have signed us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , being from Howard , we were a risk . " <p> Shai brought adult urban contemporary to a younger demographic , and though the Village Voice 's Robert Christgau castigated their debut album as " too smarmy and too slow , " ... If I Ever Fall in Love swiftly became the soundtrack to many tender come-ons and reluctant break-ups . The group is bound to attract many fans nostalgic for those days , but hopes to see new faces too , at the Feb. 21 performance in the University district , as part of the grand opening festivities of the newest outpost of Red@28 Literary Lounge . <p> " If I Ever Fall in Love , " Shai 's first and biggest hit single , cracked Billboard 's Top 10 . Success came quickly , as did tension . Van Rensalier , a music major , says he was n't surprised by the swiftness of fame . <p> " It 's kind of funny . I just knew I liked " If I Ever Fall in Love " , so I thought it would be a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people would respond . Within a few weeks it got to No. 1 in rotation in D.C. , so I assumed the same thing would happen again . Then , I learned all it took to make a hit . None of us were students of the business . The whole thing happened faster than we were able to get a team together . We kind of self-imploded . " <p> Shai 's light continued with " Comforter " and " Baby I 'm Yours , " both of which also made the pop Top 10 . But follow-up album Right Back At Cha 's " Come with Me , " " I Do n't Wan na Be Alone " and " The Place Where You Belong " saw less movement , and in 1996 the group released its last recording with all four original members . Like any rise-to-riches story , the group splintered amid dwindling success and finger-pointing . Van Rensalier prefers not to name names , but says , " One dude thought he would be the man . He allowed the industry to come between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , that 's why they do that . It 's almost like a manual ; it 's the same story . Every group has one guy who 's that . " <p> Martin was the first to leave , then Gray , then replacement member Erik Willis . Van Rensalier and Bright now perform with Dwayne Jones and George Spencer III . Van Rensalier says they are working on a 20-year anniversary album , as well as a side project between himself and Bright of all-new material , under the name DnG . Amid the hits , they 'll be performing " Tell Me Why , " one of the new songs , at the show . <p> " We tell stories , " says Van Rensalier . " That is n't changing .

@@7081092 @281092/ <h> ' CL ' is leaner and meaner these days but not too mean <h> Let 's talk <p> One thing I have gained personally from having a smaller staff at Creative Loafing these days is that it has forced me out of my comfort zone . <p> I ca n't just sit around the office and act like an editor , delegating the reporting and writing duties to a staff of journalists . At CL today , we have exactly one staff news reporter , a feature writer who serves double duty coordinating ads , and a designer . <p> Where I would once assign stories , edit them , write the occasional feature and pen an editor 's note , I now have to get out and report many of the stories myself , just like I did when I was a rookie cop reporter years ago in Burlington . <p> And that 's a beautiful thing . It 's given me the opportunity to have more face time with you , the readers , as well as with the artists and other people we profile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the restaurateurs whose food I 've written about . And while I 'm no food critic , I 've enjoyed expanding , as a writer , into areas I 've never written about before . <p> I also get to do more writing in an area that I know and love very much : music . I 've gotten out and talked to younger musicians making new music at venues in Charlotte that did n't exist when I first came to CL a little more than a decade ago . <p> In this issue , I got the chance to meet with members of The Business People , a Charlotte indie-rock band whose music I discovered while editing a story a few issues ago on Charlotte actor and filmmaker Carolyn Laws . The Business People had contributed a song to Laws ' short film Damiane and Her Demons . I liked the song and searched out the band 's 2016 EP Dirty Feelings on Bandcamp . When I heard The Business People were playing at Hattie 's last weekend and at Snug Harbor this week , I decided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read my story in the music section . <p> But no matter how much more I get out of the office to report stories , there 's no way we could do what we do at CL without our staffers and freelancers . The mix of different voices and perspectives is what gives Creative Loafing its personality and scope . Take this week 's cover story on chef Donnie Simmons . It came at the last minute during our weekly planning meeting . We had plenty of material to run , but no obvious cover .

@@7081098 @281098/ <h> David Childers Album Release <p> There are certain singer-songwriters , brilliant ones , who live and work in towns across the United States . White guys , in their 50s and 60s , who 've benefitted in countless ways from the advantages of their demographic classification , yet remain unsung heroes of music in the Woody Guthrie continuum . These are guys who never achieved the recognition of a Bob Dylan or Steve Earle . The larger pop world pays little attention to their work , but they create anyhow , because that 's what they do . Guys like Nathan Bell , over in Chattanooga , Tenn. , or Butch Hancock , out in West Texas . <p> Childers is a longtime advocate for the poor who 's used his Mount Holly law practice to help people navigate the complicated social security , disability and SSI systems . In his off time , he 's written poetry , painted and recorded 15 albums of country , folk and rock , sometimes in the experimental vein of late-period Tom Waits records . Childers ' songs revolve around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlotte , and the religious zeal that defines those characters ' lives . <p> Since 1995 , he 's issued a string of titles including Blessed in an Unusual Way ( 2002 ) , Jailhouse Religion ( 2006 ) , Burning in Hell ( 2007 ) , and Serpents of Reformation ( 2014 ) . His latest , Run Skeleton Run , comes out this week on Ramseur Records , and Childers has scheduled several area performances including an album-release party at High Rock Outfitters in Lexington May 13 and a Memorial Day show with Shovels &amp; Rope May 28 at the Whitewater Center . @qwx83906 <p> Run Skeleton Run <p> Produced by Don Dixon ( R.E.M. , Fetchin Bones ) and featuring notable contributions from the Avett Brothers , Skeleton just may be the record that gets Childers , at 65 , his largest audience yet . The album is more musically consistent , and less experimental , than much of Childers ' works , with songs from the traditional folk of " Belmont Ford " to the old-school country of " Greasy Dollar " and the gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed with the richly developed characters and narratives Childers is known for . Although Blessed , Jailhouse and Serpents all are brilliant song-cycles focused on the way religion is interweaved and often twisted into the fabric of Southern life , you almost have to be a longtime follower of Childers , or a deep listener to context , to fully grasp their intent . <p> At a show several years ago in New York , some audience members walked out on Childers when he sang " George Wallace , " from Jailhouse ; they 'd completely missed the point of the still-relevant tale of how the notorious Alabama governor had risen to political fame on a platform of hate and racism . <p> " As soon as they heard the words ' George Wallace , ' they 're like , ' Oh my , he 's a racist , ' " Childers said in 2013 .

Laughs A lot of people did n't know how to take it , because it had so many different voices . We were using people 's voices like different instruments like a different horn . Robert Childers , his son and Neal Harper just took the whole thing , processed it and did all the effects . I would lay down whatever they told me to , and then leave and go home and go to bed , and they took it and did a lot of magical things with it . But it was too weird and different for a lot of people . My thing with this new record is that I wanted it to be heard . <p> Bob Crawford of the Avett Brothers is a longtime champion of yours . Was it he who came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob called me up in 2015 and asked if I wanted to do another record with Don Dixon . He told me he wanted to do a record of me that people would take note of , and he wanted to make the best record we could make .

And they had the power to make this happen laughs , so I sure was n't going to argue with them about it . <p> Did you start writing new songs for it right away ? <p> They 're not all brand new , but I 'd say the majority of them are . There 's one song on it , " Manilla , " that 's pretty old . It was on my 1995 debut album Godzilla ! He Done Broke Out ! But I was never happy with that version . This one 's a lot better . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been around for a while , too , but I never played it .

What was going on ? @qwx83906 <p> Childers ' album ' Room 23 ' <p> It had just become a grind , man . I mean , goddamn the band was high energy , and you add to that all the long driving , very little money , and just a lot of discouragement and a lot of rejection . You make a record like Room 23 and no label is interested in it . I was frustrated . But you know , anybody that does anything like music or art , or having a law practice , or opening a restaurant , or whatever there 's those periods of uncertainty where you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next move 's going to be . <p> What prompted you to come back ? <p> I owe an eternal debt to the Avett Brothers , especially Bob . I felt like I was n't worth nothing . And he let me know that that was n't true . And now with the latest project , knowing that I was writing songs that are going to be on an album that 's going to be treated the way an album ought be treated that 's inspiring . <p> Does that determine how you write if you know it 's going to be , as you say , treated the way an album ought to be treated ? <p> Nah , not really . I have no constraints . But that 's the beauty of being on an independent label they let me do what I want to do . And I think it 's a rare thing for an artist these days to be able to be completely themselves . Ramseur is not looking to sell a whole lot of records . I mean , they want to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more about them having the respect and love for what I do as an artist to support it . That 's something you dream about as an artist . That 's why I call Bob my patron saint . And Dolph I do n't know , he 's a little more Mephistophelian . Laughs But I love him . I do . <p> Childers and members of the Avett Brothers run with ' Skeletons ' <p> When you say " do what I want to " as an artist , what do you mean ? <p> I just want to have good songs . For me , it 's like writing a book of short stories or poems . I want to have songs that are visual and visceral , that tell some kind of story , and that do what I like music to do make people move or give them an emotional reaction . It 's more about the individual songs being fit into a pattern , like a tapestry . Laughs That 's kind of a clichT , is n't it ? But like Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book I read as a kid that left an impression on me of what a literary work of art should be . <p> One of your little short stories on this record is " Radio Moscow , " with its line , " somewhere a finger is twitching by a red telephone while he 's listening to Radio Moscow . " That seems to resonate in the current political environment . Was it intentional ? <p> Actually , I wrote that song about five years ago , so the whole thing with Trump was n't out there then . The song is about my own alienation as an adolescent , where I felt like I did n't fit in at all , because I did n't . But if it makes people aware of what 's going on now that something really important and outrageous has happened in this country then I 'm all for it . <p> To be honest , I saw that aspect of the song when stuff started coming out last July about disgraced former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and about Malcolm Nance 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying attention to what was happening could see the pattern here 's this president who 's got financial ties to Russia and a lot of other corrupt places . So last summer , when we were talking about what video we were going to make , I said , " This is the one we should do the video for . " It was serendipitous . <p> When you say you did n't fit in growing up in Mount Holly , what do you mean ? <p> Well , it 's odd that I still live in this same town . And I mean , I got my own thing now that I 'm very comfortable and happy with , as far as a life . But when I was a kid living maybe a mile and a half from where I am right now , it was not a happy time . <p> Why were you not happy ? <p> I lived in a dysfunctional family environment . My parents fought a lot . I was unhappy in school . I was a teenage alcoholic . I went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wallowed in self-pity . <p> And how does " Radio Moscow " address that ? <p> Well , the radio , you know it told me that there was a bigger world out there ; that you could leave this place . And at the same time , reading Thomas Wolfe 's Look Homeward Angel helped me understand that , too . Hell , I got my folks to send me off to a military school just to get away from here . It felt liberating to me to have guards walking outside the door at night to make sure you 're studying . Laughs So that song is really a reflection on who I was then . <p> The album opens with one of your poems read by Scott Avett . Is there a difference to you between writing poetry and writing songs ? <p> If I 'm writing poetry I tend to want to keep it more austere and sparse , although there 's a song on the album , " Ghostland , " that started out as a poem and I converted it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my poetry I avoid rhyme schemes . <p> But I think there 's places where the two merge . Like with the proto-socialist Scottish poet Robert Burns he 's called a poet , because he was , but his poems were songs . And of course , William Blake he had his Songs of Innocence and Experience . You can sing those . Sings a line of Blake poetry . So it 's a murky thing . <p> The thing is , I do n't worry about it . It 's like with painting , I just do it . For years I had that editor or professor or critic in my ear , chattering away , but I finally wiped all that away . I do n't remember when I did it , but it was a good thing to do . <p> Now that you 're back to recording and performing regularly , do you feel like you 've found a new groove ? <p> Oh yeah . I 'd already been feeling like I wanted to do something more like I did back when I started , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words and stuff . I had gotten real grouchy for a while . I really did n't want to have contact with people . I just wanted people to leave me alone . But really , I had gotten sick of myself . I had gotten sick of seeing my name in the paper or my picture here and there . I was a minor-league celebrity and getting sick of it . Laughs I guess I 'm still kind of like that guy in " Radio Moscow . " I have my limits with people . <p> But you have to give yourself another chance . And that 's what I did . I 've always been lucky like that . Things happen at the right time . I 've been jumping from one sinking ship to another for a long time , but I like the one I 'm on now . It seems pretty solid .

@@7081100 @281100/ <h> Where to Eat Ethnic <h> Charlotte 's 10 best ethnic restaurants <p> Ethnic eateries are often the unsung heroes in a city 's culinary chorus . Some are cheap , fast and good ; others are predictably wonderful , while a third category takes an ethnic cuisine to a modern level . The last category is not cheap , but then you do get what you pay for . Quality costs and imported premium food items may be especially costly . <p> Charlotte has hundreds of ethnic restaurants . Selecting 10 was a daunting task , but the following group represents the ends of the spectrum : from innovative and expensive , to well-crafted perfunctory and cheap . <p> 1 . Ilios Noches : One ethnic restaurant taking its cuisine to a higher level is Ilios Noches , a creative , well-executed take on upscale Greek cuisine . Greek restaurateurs have played an important part of Charlotte 's ethnic restaurant history . But rather than opening Greek restaurants , most of these entrepreneurs who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s opened Italian restaurants , meat-and-threes , fish camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilios is Angelo Kaltsounis , whose father Tommy owns the Landmark Diner on Central Avenue . Co-owner and chef Stratos Lambos also grew up in his father 's Greek restaurant in New York , while pastry chef and partner Frank Kaltsounis ( Angelo 's brother ) is one of the most talented pastry chefs in the Southeast -- much less at an ethnic restaurant . Lunch at Ilios Noche includes a marvelous mix of spreads including the smoked eggplant with walnuts and a tzatziki made with Greek yogurt ; marinated white anchovies ; homemade sausage ; a superlative grilled chicken sandwich with roasted red pepper and feta ; roasted lamb pie ; and their meli mangio pizza with thin slices of tart granny smith apples and flecks of goat cheese . Then there 's dinner ... <p> 2 . Copper , Modern Cuisine of India : Two years ago Copper , Modern Cuisine of India breathed life into the historic Mays house in Dilworth that had seen many a restaurant come and go . Owner Pannu Singh , a native of the Punjab , opened his second restaurant after finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to banking centers and hospitals -- in other words where many well-heeled Indian expatriates work and live . With this base of expats available , Singh gambled that exploring Indian cuisine -- dishes beyond chicken tikka -- would work . And he was right . Although some still complain that Copper is " expensive , " quality ingredients cost . The menu is divided into three categories : " Traditional , " " Modern , " and " For the Gourmands . " The traditional section offers the better-known Indian dishes : tandoori , vindaloo , and tikka . But dishes carry just the right note : Curries are savory , not sweet . The items in the gourmand section are delicate and subtle , yet aromatic . Portions sizes are not huge -- there 's plenty of plate showing . The focus is on taste and presentation , two aspects often lacking in tikka emporiums . Copper offers a well-chosen wine list and wines are served in Reidel glasses . Indian beers such as Flying Horse are also popular here . Copper may not be for everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality here shines on the plate . <p> 3 . Waldhorn Restaurant : Gitta Maier is another second-generation restaurateur , growing up in her parents ' restaurant in Germany . There she decided to continue the family enterprise by going to culinary school , but emigrated to the United States to open the Waldhorn Restaurant ( named for her parents ' restaurant in Germany ) in Pineville with her husband and chef Thomas Maier , a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and a second generation German American . Waldhorn is one of those happy dining experiences you want to repeat . If you like beer and food , you wo n't find a better combo than here . In addition to items that have umlauts , there 's pasta pillows with meat and spinach and a selection of gilled sausages . But the best deal is Sunday brunch with dozens of items including homemade breads , omelettes , sauerbraten and spStzle , pork roast and red cabbage , house-made desserts and cheese grits -- we are in the South , after all . Brunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oktoberfest activities on the weekends Sept. 28 and 29 , Oct. 5 and 6 , and Oct. 12 and 13 . <p> 4 . Cuisine Malaya : A while back , Cuisine Malaya added sushi and Japanese offerings to their list , but my favorite dish is still the Roti Canai appetizer : a hand-stretched , paper-thin , grilled bread dough served with a bowl of coconut milk curry and filled with chunks of potato and thin strips of chicken . Malaysian dishes are a melt-in-the-pot blend of Asian cuisines : southern Indian , Cantonese Chinese , Thai , and Malaysian with a dash of Arabia and Portugal . Cuisine Malaya 's main dining room is a nod to tropical Asia highlighted by fans and palms . The owners have set the back space for mainly Japanese offerings . But the Malaysian dishes with married flavors and bold sauces are still what distinguishes this restaurant . <h> The city 's latest Honduran joint serves delicious food <h> Comments @qwx83907

It would seem , considering Martin 's take on pimento crawdad fritters and a candied multi-colored beet and goat cheese salad , the chef has a healthy appreciation for bar food ( foods that work with alcohol ) . While I could have done without the jalapeo relish , which overpowered the mussels lazing in an Old Meck Copper and lobster broth , the sliders on the starter list do not disappoint . Their inherent play of pork belly richness and chili heat creates depth . However , this trio totes the moniker of banh mi . Since the essence of that renowned Vietnamese sandwich is the crusty French baguette and these sliders are served on pliable bread , the description is misleading . Minor point , though . <p> The main courses are uniformly generous and sharable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starters . The cod entrTe has a pea and scallop stuffing wrapped by the filet with a hit of golden raisin agrodolce . There are other pleasures at this satisfying neighborhood spot , but the most unexpected might be the stunning desserts . Typically , pastry chefs labor in the shadows and generally come in and move on without much notice given . This is unfortunate especially in Charlotte , where desserts have become one of the most intriguing sections of the menu . New to The Summit is pastry chef Brigitte Oger . Her dessert roster is at once whimsical and tasty . Her pumpkin cake with sweet corn ( that 's right , corn ) ice cream and caramelized popcorn offers the perfect balance of flavors while being a visual feast . Be warned : You may not want to share this one . <p> The Summit Room is subject to the rhythms of the neighborhood . During glorious fall weather , I expect the large patio out front to fill first , since people- and dog-watching along East Boulevard proves entertaining . <p> What I like about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relentlessly upbeat , the best of the kitchen is first rate , and Mills ' signature brand of crowd-pleasing style , as evidenced by the cocktail list , is fun .

It 's an interesting angle although certainly not unprecedented ( see Bridesmaids , with its terrific , Oscar-nominated script by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo ) but a large degree of timidity and ( maybe ? ) an unfamiliarity with the subject at hand combine to produce a soft film that , a few R-rated hijinks aside , might as well be playing as part of a primetime sitcom lineup , with a laugh track and some soft-drink commercials thrown in to complete the effect . <p> Mila Kunis portrays the main mom , feeling crushed by the expectations placed upon her by society at large and by a dictatorial PTA head ( Christina Applegate ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severing ties with her cheating-via-Internet husband , forcing her bratty kids to do their own homework and make their own breakfasts , drinking to excess , and ( gasp ! ) walking out on a PTA meeting .

But because the federal government classifies it as a category one narcotic in other words , because it 's illegal research has been difficult to conduct . But a preponderance of anecdotal evidence , research coming out of other countries , as well as the limited research that 's done in this country seems to indicate that medical cannabis can help a lot of people with a number of different ailments , including cancer , and could be delivered at a reasonable cost . Normally , that kind of equation lends itself to having something rapidly adopted . But the perception of how cannabis is used and the perception of the types of people who use it is retarding its adoption , legitimization and use in the medical community . A number of states , including Washington and Colorado , have changed their laws , and the sky has n't fallen . People continue to report benefits , and I think it 's time for North Carolina to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our economy ? <p> The estimation that fiscal research did last session about $30 million in revenue is probably low , especially when you remember that there 's not a whole lot of history in terms of demand , taxation levels , etc . It 'll probably bring closer to $100 million a year . This has the potential to be an industry , and right now the only people who are benefiting from the demand are the cartels . <p> We can also develop a hemp-fiber industry . It was used in sails , when sailing ships were popular , but eventually hemp and cotton competed , and cotton won . Not because it was superior in all of its applications it just won because a bunch of states were already growing cotton . Part of my bill allows for research into the uses of cannabis . Hemp comes from the same plant . This is how we keep farming vital in North Carolina . <p> Who supports your effort ? Who does not ? <p> You can go around the General Assembly and find many people who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have benefited from using cannabis in a medical way . But they are extremely reluctant to go on the record . I attribute that to what I call the " Cheech and Chong , ' Up in Smoke ' " mentality . It 's a knee-jerk fear that 's unfounded and unjustified . There is also some fear because the federal government still considers it illegal . But right now the fed seems much more tolerant of state-level regulation and experimentation . <p> Do you think this bill will pass , even though Republicans are in control of the General Assembly ? <p> It 's an uphill slog , no question about it . It 's almost like trying to take something as massive as an aircraft carrier and turn it on a dime . You ca n't do it . Inertia keeps it going in whatever direction it 's been going for a while . But I 'm not sure that it 's a liberal versus conservative fight . A lot of card-carrying conservatives seem quite friendly toward the concept of change in these private conversations . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to change that , citizens who would benefit from the change have to express themselves very clearly to the people who are going to make the ultimate decisions . <p> So you 're using this bill to continue a conversation you started in 2011 , not necessarily to change things right now ? <p> Yes . Three years ago you would n't have written this article . My phone was n't ringing every week with veterans , or anyone who has any ailments , thanking me for introducing the bill in 2011 . A year ago we posted a petition online around Thanksgiving that people could sign if they supported change . By the end of the year in eight weeks we had almost 10,000 signatures . If people petition their legislators , that 's movement in the right direction . That helps change public opinion . <p> Do you think some lawmakers in Raleigh pass judgment on you because of this bill ? <p> I really have n't thought about it . If I did think about it , I 'd probably conclude that I could care less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The pharmaceutical industry has been known to lobby against this kind of legislation because medical cannabis could take the place of traditional pain medication . Some of the biggest companies in the world have a presence in the Research Triangle Park . Does that lobby have a role in North Carolina 's debate ? <p> I do n't think it 's gotten that far yet . Strangely enough , I 've been hearing stories lately about a push to make medication like Oxycodone much more difficult to get and stories that discuss pain-pill addiction . You do n't have those problems when you use medical cannabis . This argument that we 've got a growing pill addiction problem is an argument to start looking at things that are not addictive , that may be able to reach some of the same ends in a more cost-effective , easier-to-control way . <p> Medical marijuana cards are easily accessible in places like Los Angeles to people who are n't sick . Are you worried that will happen here ? <p> The gate keeper here is the medical community , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the medical community in other states . Ultimately , it boils down to you and your doctor making a determination about what type of medications are best for you . Who am I to insert my opinion ? If I were a conservative and I am not I would couch this in personal liberty terms . When the government permits you to have the widest choice , it promotes liberty . It 's when the government restricts your choices for no logical reason that you are prohibited from exercising personal liberty . <p> Some argue that denying people in pain medical marijuana is immoral . Do you agree ? <p> I 'm in the funeral business . I come into contact with people who are in terminal conditions all the time . I believe in anything that can help a person 's quality of life when they are on a one-way train out of here . If medical marijuana helps if it allows cancer patients , for instance , to have an appetite then what harm does it do ? <p> Do you believe in decriminalization of all drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made it easier for people who had convictions to get them cleaned off their records . There are a number of downside consequences to having had a conviction in your past for possession of small amounts of marijuana . But they are two separate issues , and sometimes , in this debate , they 're melded together . I do n't think they should be . The first issue is purely medical : Does cannabis work to alleviate pain , to retard cancer cells ? Does it help with MS patients ? The anecdotal evidence says it either does or that it might . If indeed this stuff works as advertised , as many people believe it does , then it ought to be available more broadly to patients . We 'll figure the other issues out later . <p> Medical marijuana advocates will meet at the state capitol in Raleigh Feb. 12 to lobby for Alexander 's bill .

But after her diagnosis Laura admitted that she thinks , " Did this cause my cancer ? I 'll probably never know , but I wonder . " <p> Kenny Coleman was nervous when we met , making a note on the video release form that I must contact him again before broadcasting our interview . He said he was worried people in their affluent Mountain Island Lake subdivision in northwest Charlotte would be upset with them for speaking to me , and they wanted to be able to sell their home and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> A lot has changed since I interviewed the Colemans . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued its long-awaited regulation last December the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities ( DCCR ) rule . It becomes effective Oct. 19 . The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality formerly the Department of Environment and Natural Resources also showed hints of getting serious about regulating coal ash . And , this past May , a Duke Energy lawyer whispered " guilty " more than 20 times to a federal judge , agreeing to a $102 million settlement and admitting to numerous violations of the U.S. Clean Water Act since 2010 . But perhaps most importantly : hundreds of citizens have galvanized after many have been warned not to drink their well water . <p> When I met the Colemans a year and a half ago , the EPA was still finalizing a new coal ash regulation . In the end , it 's more like a preferred preference than a regulation , calling coal ash a solid waste ( think household trash ) instead of hazardous waste , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ultimately , it 's now up to us to make the state enforce a federal law through lawsuits . However , while environmentalists did n't get the hazardous waste label they 'd hoped for , the new law does call for some things they wanted like the closure of ash waste ponds that fail to meet structural standards , more groundwater monitoring , the cleanup of unlined ponds that are contaminating groundwater and liners for new ponds and restrictions on where they 're located ( not in wetlands or earthquake zones ) . The DCCR rule also encourages the " beneficial reuse " of coal ash as an ingredient in other products , like concrete . <p> The EPA collected public comments at eight regional meetings nationwide while preparing the regulation . The Charlotte meeting in 2010 lasted for 13 hours , most of which was standing-room only . EPA officials said they collected nearly half a million public comments before issuing the DCCR rule . <p> Testifying before Congress in Feb. 2013 , a year before the Dan River spill , state Rep. Pricey Harrison ( D-Guilford ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are you saying that North Carolina does n't have the expertise to handle coal ash ? " <p> " Yes , sir , that 's been my experience with working with our agencies and working with the legislature , " Harrison said between interruptions . " I do n't feel that we have good regulations in place . " <p> But nearly three years later , do we now ? Gov . Pat McCrory 's administration would like you to think so , but after DEQ 's lawsuit settlement with Duke Energy last month basically a cover-your-ass move by the state in an effort to both get out of court and prevent future lawsuits that 's questionable . A fine for $25.1 million for one plant near Wilmington was reduced to a $7 million settlement for 14 , or half a million per site , that could prevent future litigation . <p> Following the Dan River spill , the N.C. General Assembly passed the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 that requires Duke to close all of its high-hazard coal ash pits by the end of 2019 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.C. Coal Ash Management Commission . McCrory , known for his close relationship with former employer Duke , then argued that he should have been the one to appoint the commissioners , not the legislature . In May , a judge agreed and the commission 's work halted . Its website still reads " under construction , " but what is there is largely incorrect . Five months after the judge 's order , I asked the governor 's office if McCrory plans to create his own commission . They did n't respond . <p> The N.C. DEQ , the agency that should enforce EPA 's rule , has been squirrelly on the coal-ash issue for years , even before McCrory was elected . But then his original appointments for DEQ 's top positions were John Skvarla , a man who believes oil is a renewable resource , and Mitch Gillespie , a known DEQ-hater . So , it 's amusing and not in a funny way when the department crows about being on top of things , because they are n't . <p> Duke Energy has made some progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at its Riverbend plant , located a dozen miles from Uptown and with waste ponds near the sandbar on the edge of Charlotte 's main drinking-water reservoir . Crews will haul that ash to landfills in Georgia , Virginia , and Lee and Chatham counties in North Carolina once the necessary permits come through . <p> Both the state and Duke insist they 're basing their coal-ash related decisions on sound science , but that 's hardly comforting when you realize the leading scientific experts in the state have n't heard from them . When I asked DEQ if it sought guidance from a well-known environmental scientist at Duke University , communications director Crystal Feldman said , " We welcome his input . We welcome input from any source as long as it can be scientifically proven . " <p> I asked the scientist , Dr. Avner Vengosh , if anyone from the state has contacted him . His response ? Laughter . " Of course not . Why would you expect them to call ? " he asked . Because Vengosh honed a test that can determine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit of coal ash , and his peer-reviewed study about coal ash 's radioactivity was recently published in a journal called Environmental Science &amp; Technology that 's why . He 's an expert on the topic who 's researched coal-ash pollution since the massive Tennessee Valley Authority spill that knocked homes from their foundations when an earthen dam burst in the middle of the night just before Christmas in 2008 . <p> I also asked Dr. Dennis Lemly , a scientist at Wake Forest University and for the U.S. Forest Service , if anyone from the state has asked him about his work . He 's been researching coal-ash waste near Duke 's Belews Creek plant since the mid-1970s and says he has " made a career out of counting dead fish . " No one has reached out to him either , he said , but like Vengosh , he 's willing to work with the state and Duke . <p> In DEQ 's defense , it 's not uncommon for government agencies to rely on industry for engineering and scientific help after all , industry has the swankiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to beleaguered environmental departments across the country , including the EPA , which is under frequent attack from the GOP-led U.S. House of Representatives . Since 2011 , the House has six-times passed legislation that would prevent the EPA from properly regulating coal ash . The bills never made it to the president . <p> When I asked Duke Energy if they 've reached out to Vengosh I was directed to a coal-industry lobbyist , Edison Electric Institute , for " perspective on this . " Duke says it has conducted studies of its own that proves radioactivity is n't a concern . <p> That 's why , Vengosh said , " It 's important that when we work on a topic , we publish it in peer-reviewed journals . The two studies are n't white papers or opinions , " he said . " It 's procedure that would be very difficult for anyone to reject without giving scientific evidence to un-prove it . " <p> Duke Energy does work with scientists at UNC Charlotte 's National Ash Management Advisory Board , but guess who funds that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doing good work , but the arrangement is awkward , especially since my six years of reporting on this topic have left me with the impression that industry only backs research that supports its position . <p> That 's why we may never know if Laura Coleman 's cancer or your mother 's Alzheimer 's disease or your child 's learning disabilities are coal-ash related there 's little money for that sort of research even though the federal government has long known that many of the elements found in coal ash cause a litany of health problems . <p> For decades , the coal industry has produced engineering and groundwater monitoring reports that it shares with the state . However , until Harrison 's legislation passed in 2010 , the company 's manmade dams were exempt from the Dam Safety Act and were only being inspected every five years . Now they 're inspected every two years , and once the EPA stepped in after the TVA disaster we learned that North Carolina has more high-hazard coal ash ponds than any other state , all now owned by Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam fail , people might die and the economic impact would be tremendous . Or , as Mecklenburg County 's water quality program manager , Rusty Rozzelle , told us last year , " It would be the biggest catastrophe Charlotte 's ever seen " if the coal-ash dams on the edge of the city 's main drinking water source failed . <p> Since the TVA disaster , Duke Energy has basically asserted , " We 've got this . Do n't worry . " Frankly , I , too , believed they would step up their game , and there was evidence they had . In 2000 , the coal industry made a deal with EPA that it would self-monitor if the agency could avoid regulation . But it was eight years before the company installed monitoring wells at its Riverbend plant . The ash waste pits at Riverbend are so close to the beach-like sandbar that it technically needs monitoring wells in the middle of Mountain Island Lake , but the state moved the compliance boundary to the far side of the lake . We now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that groundwater is contaminated near every single one of the company 's coal-ash dumps in North Carolina . <p> Hundreds of people in North Carolina have received " do not drink " orders this year after water wells were tested by DEQ . Duke insists the contaminants discovered are n't due to coal-ash , according to its own testing , yet they began providing bottled water to residents anyway . <p> At a press conference in Raleigh last month , Belmont resident Larry Mathis said his water deliveryman told him the contract with Duke Energy to deliver water ends at the end of this year . Duke representative Paige Sheehan said , " At some point , we will discontinue the water service we are providing . No specific timetable has been set , but we will communicate directly with residents on the next steps and will provide them plenty of notice . " <p> When I asked Catawba Riverkeeper Sam Perkins if he thought Duke should connect affected residents to municipal water he said , " At this point , I 'm kind of impressed that Duke Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have no control over the high-hazard coal ash ponds contaminating the city 's drinking water reservoir , but local government could be on the hook for new water lines . Last month 's settlement between DEQ and Duke equates to a $500,000 fine for pollution at its Mountain Island Lake location instead of the original $25.1 million for groundwater contamination at its Sutton plant ... where Duke is running municipal water to residents . Sheehan said cleanup costs could be passed along to ratepayers if the N.C. Utility Commission agrees to a rate hike when Duke asks for one . <p> It 's up to North Carolina 's voters and Duke Energy 's shareholders to demand anything different . For environmentalists , who often represent citizens in pollution lawsuits , one bright spot is the EPA 's just-updated rule that sets federal limits on the levels of toxic metals that power plants can discharge in their wastewater . Industry and environmentalists alike are awaiting the technical details of that update . In the meantime , it 's clear the agency has found another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how long before the U.S. House of Representatives aims back in this domestic water war ? <p> For now , while lawyers on all sides work to find holes in the new regulations and settlement , many in North Carolina just want two things : clean water and to be considered as stake holders . That 's what a group of activists asked for last month while announcing that they 're uniting as " the Alliance of Carolinians Together ( A.C.T. ) . " <p> As for Laura Coleman , she died at her home at age 56 . During our interview she told me , " I 'm not looking to sue anybody , that 's not who I am . But if it came to light that ( coal ash ) did cause my cancer if somehow there was some proof , then I want them to clean it up . That 's what I want . " <p> *Names changed to protect identities . <p> Info Leaks <p> Part of Duke Energy 's probation agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice involves paying for a toll-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental violations at any Duke Energy-owned plant . Duke must report the calls and their responses to the government . " It 's not ideal , " said Lisa Evans of Earthjustice , " but I think we have to live with the fact that Duke pays for the hotline .

If you know him at all , it 's as the front man of the band Melt or as the guy who tends the bar at Petra 's and spins records at DJ Pucci Mane . Pucci 's a bit of an introvert , and he would never claim to be the mastermind behind one of Charlotte 's coolest , most cutting-edge music festivals . <p> So we 'll do it for him . <p> In 2014 , the Charlotte musician-turned-promoter launched Reverb Fest with an eclectic event at the Neighborhood Theatre featuring 10 local bands . Three years later , he 's organizing the festival 's most ambitious iteration a full day boasting 14 acts spread over four venues in Plaza Midwood and NoDa : the Neighborhood Theatre , Snug Harbor , The Station and Lunchbox Records . The bill reflects Pucci 's eclectic tastes , with performers ranging from local neosoul group Blame the Youth to Neighborhood headliners Of Montreal . Creative Loafing talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoter . <p> Creative Loafing : Can you give us a rundown of your career as a musician ? <p> Phil Pucci : I began playing guitar when I was about 13 and started my first band that same week . It was a Blink 182 cover band . My first serious band , Beneath the Dream , played a few legitimate venues . I played in a couple of other bands like Almighty Flying Machine , and then in 2009 I moved to Portland . <p> When I came back to Charlotte in 2011 , I started Serfs , a band with all of my high school friends . That 's when I started to become more involved in Charlotte 's music scene . I wanted to give back to the music scene that has given a lot to me . Being in Serfs made me realize that booking shows was n't that difficult if you know all the people that you need to know . Being in a band is such a good way to meet those people , and you earn their trust . I would book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my other bands . <p> Around that time I started dating my fiancT Shirley . She encouraged me to promote bigger shows . That got me interested in bringing mid-level touring acts to Charlotte . It 's one of the things that Charlotte has notoriously struggled with getting bands to come through . At that point Charlotte music had become a full-time gig for me . <p> What gave you the idea to launch Reverb ? <p> Some people in the music scene influenced me , specifically Zachary Reader and Joshua Robbins . Each threw their own summer festival in Charlotte . Zachary did Recess Fest for a few years , and Joshua did Treasure Fest . They were n't like these big blown-out festivals . They were celebrations of awesome underground music regionally and locally . It was so much fun going venue-hopping during each festival . That inspired me to aim for something along those lines . Both of those festivals , sadly , discontinued a couple years back . @qwx83906 <p> Photo by Joshua Thomas <p> Phil Pucci . <p> The first Reverb Fest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , basically just my friends ' bands . It was like a really long show with a couple of vendors . It was a baby step for me , but it ended up being super successful . I decided to keep going with it . <p> I did two ( more at the Neighborhood ) in 2015 . One was a winter version called Eskimo Kisses . Reverb Fest was at Snug Harbor last year . It was like the same deal as before , just 12 bands at one venue , but we included some out-of-town bands <p> When you started putting the festivals together , did it all come together easily , or was there a learning curve ? <p> For the first Reverb Fest , things went smoothly because I stayed in my wheelhouse , which was booking local bands . Then I started working with mid-level touring acts and their booking agents , and it ended up being a big learning experience . I had to learn how to talk to agents , and what certain things mean . For Reverb Fest two , three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring acts through figuring out what to say and how to negotiate money . <p> This year , you 're mixing nationally known bands with local and regional acts . What was it like landing Of Montreal ? <p> I 'm really fan-boying out about Of Montreal coming , because at one point I was listening to nothing else but them for a whole summer . They meant a lot to me at a certain point in my life , and they still mean a lot to me now .

I looked at the swag bag that read : To have and to hold all your wedding inspiration . " *insert actual LOL moment* My mom would have me pose with this bag and pretend like I 'm getting ready to get married ... little did she know the drama I 'd have the following week . But I digress . <p> A few weeks ago , I was at Common Market in Plaza Midwood with friends of friends . One of the guy 's girlfriend 's asked something along the lines of , " Have you heard about something called ' The Big Fake Wedding ? ' I found it on Groupon for $10 . Apparently , you go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have free drinks . We should go ! " Umm , free drinks ? You know I was down . She 's much closer to marriage than I am so I thought it would be fun to go with her . I responded , " Yes , let 's do it ! " <p> Within the next couple of days I was ready to make the purchase . I took a look at the Groupon and began to stalk anything related to " The Big Fake Wedding " on Google . After some research , I gathered that the event is designed for wedding planners , engaged folks and the like interested in exploring local vendors and/or venues for wedding ceremonies . I did n't fall into any of those categories , but I repeat , there were going to be free drinks . <p> I called my mom super excited to tell her about the not-so-drunken pregame event I 'd be going to .

After all , I was so worth it . <p> Despite no RSVP ( whoops ) we had no issue getting in . We were only 15 minutes away from the ceremony so I opted out of visiting the vendors beforehand to grab a good seat . I mean , how many times have you made it on time to a wedding and snagged prime seating ? Despite being located near and surrounded by the business parks off of Tyvola , you would n't have even been able to tell once you were seated in front of the beautiful florals that would serve as the backdrop for the ceremony . <p> While a violinist and harpist played John Legend 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake ceremony " would simply be random people .

The scandal with the most points wins . Here we go ... <p> The Participants : Gen. David Petraeus &amp; Paula Broadwell <p> When : 2012 <p> The Scandal : David Petraeus , America 's most famous general and creator of " the surge , " apparently surged right into an affair with his worshipful , official biographer , Paula Broadwell , who lives on Mount Vernon Avenue in Dilworth . Broadwell followed the general around for months in Afghanistan and elsewhere , and before they knew it , lessons in fighting an insurgency were shoved aside for demonstrations of traditional American bed-rasslin ' .

Jill Kelley , a Tampa socialite and military hanger-on , told an FBI friend that she had received threatening emails . The agent traced the emails to Broadwell , and more snooping revealed the Charlottean 's affair with Petraeus . The agent then notified FBI director Robert Mueller , who took no action after the bureau concluded that national security breaches had not occurred . Kelley 's FBI agent pal , when not sending shirtless photos of himself to Kelley , concluded that the Obama administration was covering up for the general . He contacted U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , who told the FBI about the call ; soon after , James Clapper , the director of national intelligence , urged Petraeus to resign . <p> The Scandal : The U.S. senator from North Carolina was a good-looking guy who had a lot of people fooled . In the end , Edwards suffered the most precipitous fall from grace of any presidential candidate in living memory . His wife Elizabeth 's public battle with breast cancer had earned her national fame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming 2008 presidential race . Then came revelations that he 'd had an affair , and a child , with Rielle Hunter , a graceless clod and filmmaker for Edwards ' campaign . At first , Edwards denied having an affair ; he later admitted to the dalliance but denied being the child 's father . Andrew Young , a close Edwards aide , said later that Edwards had called Hunter a " crazy slut " and asked him to " steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this was indeed his child . " Nice touch , huh ? By early 2010 , Edwards admitted to having fathered the child , at which point Elizabeth Edwards had enough and left him . If that was n't bad enough , a few days later , reports revealed that the lovely John-Rielle pairing had also produced a sex tape . Hunter moved to a house in Dilworth in 2009 . Elizabeth Edwards died in December 2010 . In May of this year , Edwards was acquitted of one charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other counts . <p> The Scandal : Ah , the meteoric rise and the train-wreck collapse of PTL , the evangelical TV ministry run by the Howdy Doodyesque Rev. Jim Bakker and his wife , a walking mascara tube named Tammy Faye . From the mid- ' 70s to the late- ' 80s , the couple made fools of themselves and their viewers by building their Heritage USA complex in Fort Mill , peddling a ludicrous version of the " Prosperity Gospel " and defrauding their viewers/contributors out of millions . The scandal that finally pushed Bakker out of his pseudo-religious empire , though , was his admission that he and another preacher had had sex with Jessica Hahn , a 21-year-old church secretary from New York , in 1980 and had paid her hundreds of thousands to keep quiet . How sleazy was Bakker ? Well , Hahn says that during sex he tried to ease her " concerns " by telling her , " When you help the shepherd , you 're helping the sheep . " Later revelations about Bakker included the time a PTL worker found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heritage Grand Hotel . Bakker was naked and Taggart was massaging Bakker 's testicles presumably with neither Tammy Faye 's permission nor the Lord 's blessing . No word on whether Taggart got a bonus . Meanwhile , Hahn made a career out of her extended 15 minutes of fallen churchlady fame , appearing in a Playboy spread , becoming a semi-regular on Howard Stern 's radio show and guesting on the popular TV sitcom Married ... with Children . <p> The Scandal : Call this the Case of the Rehab Meat Market : In September of 1997 , Leslie Price met George Shinn then-Charlotte Hornets owner and self-righteous homunculus who portrayed himself as a model Christian at Amethyst Behavioral Health Center . Price was in an outpatient drug-treatment program . Shinn was visiting a nephew at the center . Price alleged that Shinn offered to drive her to his lawyer for help with her child-custody problems . Instead , she charged , he drove her to his home in Tega Cay , where he pushed her onto his bed and forced her to perform oral sex . Price claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to " do this again sometime . " A few days later , Price went to the police . Shinn , married at the time , claimed the romp was consensual . Prosecutors did n't file charges against Shinn . Price later sued Shinn for kidnap and sexual assault in civil court in a trial broadcast on Court TV , during which Shinn also admitted to having sex for two years with a Hornets cheerleader . Shinn 's lawyer , Bill Diehl , in Johnnie Cochran-style rhetoric , uttered the infamous line , " If she was n't bitin ' , she was n't fightin ' . " The jury ruled in Shinn 's favor , but his reputation in Charlotte was toast from then on , particularly after Price 's husband committed suicide . When Shinn later started demanding more money from the city for an arena , the answer was no . He left town shortly after . <p> The Scandal : Walton was a respected politician who did much to plug Charlotte 's African-American community into local government a trailblazer and a mover and shaker from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a thing for young men , and that got him in trouble . In 1987 , he was found guilty and served time for sexually assaulting an 18-year-old high school student . Walton had picked up the young man on The Plaza and drove to his office at St. Paul Presbyterian , where Walton was pastor . In graphic testimony , the young man described how Walton took his briefcase out of the trunk of his car and opened it in his office , revealing a towel , a jar of Vaseline and a camera . Later that year , the incident inspired a local rock band to change its name for one gig only to Bob Walton 's Briefcase . The commissioner/preacher served 30 days in jail , refused to resign as commissioner , and kept on getting re-elected . Today , one of the county 's largest office buildings is named Bob Walton Plaza . He died in 1994 . <p> As you can see , Charlotte 's no shrinking violet when it comes to high-profile sex scandals .

@@7081201 @281201/ <h> Nocturnal Animals : Built Ford Tough <h> Rating : **1/2 <p> Tom Ford , the fabulously successful fashion designer who made a name for himself at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent before launching his own label , first tried his hand at filmmaking with 2009 's A Single Man , an art-house effort for which he ambitiously served as writer ( adapting Christopher Isherwood 's novel ) , director and producer . A stylish and sympathetic look at a gay college professor coping with the death of his partner , the film earned strong reviews as well as a Best Actor Oscar nomination for lead Colin Firth . <p> Ford 's sophomore effort , Nocturnal Animals , matches his first picture in terms of its visual vibrancy and solid performances , but it has opted to replace its beating heart with a leaden paperweight . It 's also a rudderless affair , merging two tales that never properly link up . In one , Susan Morrow ( Amy Adams ) , unhappily married to a womanizing lout ( Armie Hammer ) , receives a manuscript in the mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The film 's other narrative thread is the story that Susan reads , a harrowing tale about a family ( Gyllenhaal , Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber ) terrorized by vicious rednecks while stranded in the middle of Nowhere , Texas . <p> The story-within-a-story is cruel rather than clever , with Ford ( working from Austin Wright 's novel ) more interested in tastefully ( tastelessly ? ) laying out nude corpses than in providing anything more substantial than a threadbare version of Death Wish . What substantially elevates this portion is Michael Shannon , who 's typically off-kilter and intense as a detective who wants to see justice done by any means necessary . The other narrative largely wastes Adams ' formidable talents but nevertheless maintains interest with its look at a woman reflecting on the disintegration of her previous marriage via flashbacks and coping with the roiling emotions regarding the people in her life . Unfortunately , this ends in calculated ambiguity that plays more like airless affectedness . <h> Comments @qwx83907 
@@7081209 @281209/ <h> Film Clips <p> THE ANT BULLY It used to be Oscar-bait productions that had no trouble snagging the A-listers . Now it 's the kiddie flicks that have them lining up to sign on the dotted line . But the problem with the high-powered lineup on view here -- Julia Roberts , Nicolas Cage , Meryl Streep and Paul Giamatti -- is that it promises a viewing experience that never materializes . Writer-director John A. Davis ' slender screenplay might have well been produced by a committee well-versed in mining the usual kid-friendly clichTs . Forget comparisons to Antz or A Bug 's Life ( both superior to this ) : The Ant Bully , in which a little boy gets shrunk to ant size and learns all about friendship and teamwork from the busy little bugs , is indistinguishable from any other subpar toon flick that mixes bodily function gags with snooze-inducing " lessons " and believes it 's being profound and inspirational . Alas , the only thing it inspired in me was a sudden urge to spray the screen with Raid . <p> *1/2 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to create memorable or meaningful horror flicks , which makes this British import all the more welcome . One of the finest terror tales in many a full moon , writer-director Neil Marshall 's gory gem follows six outdoor enthusiasts -- all female -- as they embark on a spelunking expedition deep in the Appalachian mountains . The competitive Juno ( Natalie Mendoza ) leads the outfit while Sarah ( Shauna Macdonald ) tries to overcome a recent tragedy in her life ; along with the others , they descend deep into a cavern that 's frightening even before its cannibalistic occupants ( who all look like Gollum 's cousins ) show up and start tearing into human flesh . The Descent is so expertly made that it more than holds its own as a full-throttle horror flick , yet it 's Marshall 's decision to provide it with a psychological bent that puts it firmly over the top . The film addresses guilt -- specifically , survivor 's guilt -- in a welcome manner and imbues its protagonists with messy moral dilemmas that allow them to alternate between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior .

Night Shyamalan ( The Sixth Sense , Signs ) has exposed himself as a filmmaker of limited means ; if this pattern of diminishing returns continues , he may soon be reduced to trying to revive the long dormant Police Academy series . For now , though , we 're stuck with this dud about an apartment complex superintendent ( Paul Giamatti ) who tries to protect a Narf ( sea nymph ) from a Scrunt ( wolf ) until she can make contact with the Great Eatlon ( eagle ) , all the while keeping one eye peeled for the Tartutic ( killer monkeys ) .

Joey Ramone would have been proud . <p> ***1/2 <p> MIAMI VICE One of the damnedest movies I 've seen this summer , Miami Vice is successful only part of the time and confounding all the way through . Since his days as a guiding light on the trendsetting TV series from the 1980s , Michael Mann has revealed himself as a sober , serious filmmaker ( Heat , The Insider ) , so it 's no surprise that his big-screen version bears little resemblance to its TV counterpart .

All the while , it was his way of breaking down my walls and gaining my trust . " <p> After they checked into a hotel , Mourning went to bed alone . But in the middle of the night , three men , including Mourning 's agent , came into her room . The agent forced her to take a Valium , making her feel numb and disoriented .

He filmed and photographed himself raping her , uploaded the videos to the Internet anyway and sold them to websites . <p> Mourning , now 25 , was a victim of sex trafficking , the criminal act of using fraud , force and coercion to sexually exploit people for profit . Victims include anyone forced to perform a sex act to earn money for a trafficker , according to the North Carolina Coalition Against Human Trafficking . Sex trafficking is characterized by psychological and physical coercion and can include , but does not require , transportation of the victim . <p> North Carolina consistently ranks in the top 10 most active states in the country for sex trafficking , according to the coalition . Reasons include the state 's transient population , including immigrants who could be in debt bondage , which is when someone pledges themselves to labor to repay a loan . More cases of sex trafficking are reported in Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2012 annual report from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center , likely because it is the biggest city between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta , and the airport is the sixth busiest in the U.S. <p> In October 2012 , Mourning launched All We Want is L.O.V.E. , short for Liberation of Victims Everywhere . As the founder and owner of this local nonprofit , she is committed to raising awareness about sex trafficking in the U.S. and around the world by helping to fund existing human trafficking rescue and advocacy groups . L.O.V.E . eventually will use donations to build its own shelters . Mourning 's first fund-raising event was a cocktail party at Pisces Sushi Bar and Lounge in Charlotte . She 'll host a black-tie soiree Jan. 19 at The Blake Hotel . <p> One of Mourning 's biggest goals for L.O.V.E . is to eliminate the stereotypes about sex trafficking among women . While watching the Susan G.

Women who have been trafficked " would n't be afraid to come out as victims , because they would n't be afraid that the girl next to her is going to say she 's a whore or she deserved it , " she says . <p> Next year , Mourning is planning a trip to Calcutta , India , with L.O.V.E . team member Ashley Harkrader , a former event coordinator for NC Stop Human Trafficking who won the title of Mrs. Natural Elite in the 2012 Mrs. North Carolina pageant on her platform of sex trafficking .

In 2011 , she told her then-boyfriend about being forced into sex trafficking , and he found the Internet videos of her being raped .
