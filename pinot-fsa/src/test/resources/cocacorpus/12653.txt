Since the late 1960s , all of South Australia 's Governors have been Australian citizens . <p> The Governor 's powers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Letters Patent issued by The Queen on 14th February 1986 . ( At this time , the few constitutional links that still remained between Australia and the United Kingdom were formally severed and new provisions put in place . ) <p> The role of the Governor ( the Vice-Regal representative ) has changed significantly since the founding of the Province of South Australia in 1836 . In the early years , the Governor alone determined matters of policy , made laws and was responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the management of the colony . Representative government ( i.e. through the election of Parliamentary representatives ) was achieved in South Australia in 1856 . <p> In summary , the Governor 's role is as the local head of state ' for South Australia , exercising constitutional , ceremonial and community duties . <p> - <h> Constitutional duties <p> With rare exceptions ( see section below on the Reserve Powers ) , a Governor exercises executive power only on the advice of Ministers who are responsible to the Parliament . That advice is generally conveyed through the South Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Governor presides over the Executive Council every Thursday morning ( and more often if required ) . The Governor has a supervisory role to ensure that the processes of the Executive Council are conducted lawfully and regularly , and accordingly may ask questions and seek further information from Ministers ; he is entitled to be consulted and to encourage and warn his Ministers . <p> In the Executive Council , the Governor gives formal and legal effect to acts of Parliament and to those decisions of Cabinet which require action by the Governor , such as senior appointments . <p> Examples of the Governor 's constitutional powers include the power : <p> to dissolve Parliament and issue writs ( commands ) for a general election ; <p> to appoint Ministers and dismiss them ; <p> to assent to bills passed by both houses of Parliament ; <p> to issue regulations and proclamations under existing laws ; <p> to appoint judges , royal commissioners and the most senior public servants ; and <p> to exercise the prerogative of mercy ( that is , the Governor may issue pardons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> When exercising a statutory power ( i.e. one that is specified in legislation , such as appointing members to a board ) , the Governor must act with the advice and consent of the Executive Council ( s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1915 ) . <p> - <h> Reserve Powers <p> There are some limited circumstances in which the Governor is authorised , indeed required , to act notwithstanding the absence of such advice . These involve the exercise of the " reserve powers " . <p> Following the enactment of the Australia Act , it would seem that the Governor 's reserve powers are restricted to the appointment and dismissal of the Premier , i.e : <p> the power to appoint a Premier if an election has resulted in a hung parliament ' ( i.e. not a clear outcome ) ; <p> the power to dismiss a Premier when he or she has lost the confidence of the Parliament ; <p> the power to dismiss a Premier or Minister when he or she is acting unlawfully ; and <p> the power to refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier . <p> - <h> Ceremonial duties <p> The Governor officiates at many important ceremonies , such as the formal Opening of Parliament , the Swearing-In of the Premier and Ministers and the Investiture of Australian Honours ( bestowed on people for their service to the community , or for bravery ) . For information about the Australian Honours system click here . <p> Governors usually " take the salute " at important parades such as Anzac Day and Australia Day Parades ; participate in commemorations such as Remembrance Day in November and many others ; deliver addresses on significant occasions such as Proclamation Day in December ; and officiate at the opening of major conferences or substantial new buildings and facilities . <p> - <h> Community role <p> The Governor meets citizens throughout the state and encourages and rewards their efforts to promote the well-being of the community . Country visits and industry visits contribute to the Governor 's knowledge of the state and its people . <p> If you wish to invite the Governor and/or spouse to an event , please see the information here . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor 's spouse is also approached to be patron of many organisations . To invite the Governor or spouse to be patron , click here . <p> Government House is used by the Governor as a venue for receptions and other events which encourage and acknowledge the achievements of individuals and organisations . Thousands of people attend such functions each year . <p> The Governor sends congratulatory messages to South Australians who have achieved significant milestones in their lives such as 100th birthdays and 50th wedding anniversaries . For further information about these messages , click here . <p> - <h> The Lieutenant Governor <p> The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the Governor for a term during the Governor 's pleasure ' . <p> The role does not in itself carry any specific duties or powers , except that the appointee is the first person called upon to act as the Vice - Regal representative in the absence of the Governor . Where the Governor will be absent ( i.e. from Adelaide ) for four weeks or less or is suffering from a temporary illness , the Lieutenant Governor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Lieutenant Governor may also assume the administration of the State as Administrator and exercise the powers and functions of the Governor if the office of the Governor is vacant ( eg in the period between Governors ) or the Governor is on extended leave . The Lieutenant Governor can only act in place of the Governor on the written request of the Premier . If the Lieutenant Governor is not available to act as the Governors Deputy , the Chief Justice is the next in line to be appointed . <p> The Governor 's Deputy or Administrator performs the powers and functions of the Governor specified in an instrument of appointment made by the Governor , during the period specified . This usually consists of all the powers and authorities of the Governor , except the power to appoint a deputy .

There is no concession applied to this component of overall registration costs because it applies to a class of vehicle rather than to the owner . <h> Lifetime Support Scheme <p> The Lifetime Support Scheme is funded by the levy and administered by the Lifetime Support Authority ( LSA ) . It is part of a national agreement to create a better insurance scheme for those who sustain serious lifelong disabilities in car accidents .

The legislation empowered the Board to take records into its custody and provided for the recovery of government documents in the hands of ' unauthorised persons ' . The Act , in modified form , was incorporated into the Libraries Act 1982 . The State Records Act was enacted in 1997 . <p> Although originally established as a department in its own right , effective control of the Archives passed to the State Library in 1961 .

The archival records of private individuals , churches , societies and businesses held by the South Australian Archives were combined with published material from the South Australian Collection of the State Library to establish the Mortlock Library of South Australia ( December 1985 ) . <p> Progressively from December 1987 , the Public Record Office left the State Library basement . In June 1988 , the purpose-built Gepps Cross facility ( Cavan Road ) was officially opened and operated as a shared facility with the Australian Archives - the first such arrangement between a state and commonwealth archival agency .

Additionally , the National Archives ( formerly the Australian Archives ) began to reduce its holdings at the Gepps Cross Repository and by 1999 State Records had taken over the entire site . <p> From 1995-1997 , State Records sat under Services SA and in November 1997 was incorporated into the Department for Administrative and Information Services ( DAIS ) . In 2006 , as part of South Australia 's State Budget , a restructure of the South Australian public sector was announced , which included the abolition of DAIS . As a result , on 1 October 2006 , State Records became a business unit of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet .

Alternatively you can contact Council's- Cultural Heritage Project Officer- or on 8408 1368 . <p> The heritage of the City of Charles Sturt is celebrated and shared under nine key themes that represent the important stories that our community tell about themselves and the place they live . The themes are : <p> Sport is our lifeThe City of Charles Sturt has a strong sporting tradition , from local Saturday afternoon competitions to venues for major national leagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting culture is combined with a social life that has involved " making your own fun " , by enjoying time with family and friends , and getting outside and adventuring in natural areas . <p> Coming staying and making this place homeThe City of Charles Sturt is built on migration , people who have come from other places and found their spot here . This theme explores our rich and diverse community and tells the stories about how different groups have made this City their home : establishing clubs , religious places , schools and businesses . <p> Misery in a mosaic pot tough times community action and local identityThis theme brings together the perception , and in some cases reality , of ' the bad side of town ' , slums , poverty , and the strong sense of local identity and community spirit that is often born out of this . <p> ' Misery ' refers to ' Port Misery ' , as Adelaide 's first port ( situated in the now West Lakes area ) was commonly known , and ' mosaic pot ' alludes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greening . <p> WarWhile war was fought in far off places , its impact and Australia 's concern with defence has shaped the City of Charles Sturt . From fear of Russian invasion , to a new start for those fleeing conflict and its aftermath , war changed us . <p> Blue denim blood celebrating our manufacturing heritageThe City of Charles Sturt was once Adelaide 's manufacturing heartland . A strong sense of pride in being a ' worker ' , of having found employment and opportunity in the factories and other industries of Hindmarsh and Woodville is still evident in the current community . The strength of this theme is that it is heavily embedded in the community - it is more than just telling the individual histories of prominent companies . <p> Sand swamp and clayThe City of Charles Sturt inhabits a dynamic natural environment , which over time , has been sculpted , shaped , drained , constructed and constructed upon to become the metropolitan place it is today . <p> This is a significant theme that tells the story of the relationship between people and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration as in building this City we have profoundly altered the environment . <p> The beach is our placeThe City of Charles Sturt enjoys an 11.5km stretch of coast , from West Beach in the south to Semaphore Park in the north . It is an iconic environment heavily woven with meanings and experiences . <p> For many , the coast is quintessential to life in Charles Sturt . For others it is a place of summer joy - a canvas for fond memories : seaside pools , grand residences , fishing , exploring sand dunes , greasy fish ' n ' chips , hot vinyl car seats , legs dangling from trams across the viaduct , gale force winds and thumping storms . <p> Charles Sturt peopleThe City of Charles Sturt takes its name from explorer Captain Charles Sturt , who made his home in ' the reedbeds ' .

@@26096781 @6096781/ <h> Commonly Asked Questions <p> An executor is the person or organisation that you have appointed to be responsible for carrying out the wishes you have stated in your Will . Your executor is responsible for the entire administration of your estate until all of your assets have been distributed to your beneficiaries . <p> Anybody can be an executor , however , if the executor is under 18 years of age the Court will appoint the childs- guardian- as the executor until the child reaches 18 years of age . Your executor must be someone with the capacity to administer complex legal and financial affairs , although they can also seek advice on and support to carry out their duties . <p> Many people appoint a friend or relative as their executor . This may be a way of expressing respect for that person , but in reality it can be a time consuming , complex , and challenging task . Your executor is taking on a big responsibility at a time when they may be grieving . <p> When selecting your executor you must be satisfied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and skills , to carry out the administration of your estate . <p> It is important to consider any conflicts of interest that may arise when appointing an executor . For example , appointing an executor who is also a beneficiary of your estate may place them in a difficult position where there is either a real or perceived conflict of interest . <p> You must talk with those you are considering appointing as your executor , to make sure they are willing to take on the role . <p> You can also choose to appoint us as your executor . We will administer your estate competently and impartially , and ensure that your wishes , as expressed in your Will , are carried out . You can have the peace of mind of knowing exactly how much our services will cost and that these fees will not change regardless of how long the administration of your estate takes .

This may take some time and it is important that steps are taken to protect the deceased person 's estate assets in the meantime , which may include putting certain items such as valuable jewellery and antique furniture into storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of probate , generally referred to as probate , is a formal document issued by the Supreme Court . It confirms that the Will of a deceased person has been proven to be properly executed and grants the right to administer the estate to the executor named in the Will . <p> Prior to probate , the executor has the discretion to decide who is entitled to a copy of the Will , although copies will usually be provided to the beneficiaries sharing in the residue of the estate . <p> The Will is lodged with the Supreme Court Probate Registry as part of the probate application .

A city that promotes innovation , health and wellbeing and provides opportunities for connection , inclusion and participation . <p> The City of Unley has prepared a Development Plan Amendment ( DPA ) pursuant to sections 24 and 25 of the Development Act 1993 to amend the Unley ( City ) Development Plan . <p> The City of Unley and the State Government hold the long-term goal of revitalising the heart of Unley by generating new activity , more sustainable retail , and increased residential living opportunities in the Unley Central area . To aid in visioning what the nature of this rejuvenation might entail , the City of Unley commissioned the preparation of the Unley Central Precinct Plan . The goals and visions set out in the Precinct Plan can not be actioned without first amending the Councils Development Plan for the area . <p> The Development Plan is a plan required under the State Governments Development Act to help guide new development . <p> Council needs to ensure that its Development Plan delivers what is needed for the future growth and prosperity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the goals of the Unley Central Precinct Plan , Council will need to amend its current Development Plan . <p> The Development Plan Amendment ( DPA ) will encourage residential development and set a height limit for the area while providing for progressive reductions in height at the perimeter of the zone . Currently the Unley District Centre Zone has no specific building height limits or envelopes ( increasing setbacks for increasing height ) . As part of the process , the suburbs of the Unley Council area which are most important from a Conservation and Streetscape perspective will be given enhanced protection . <p> The Development Plan is required to align with the State Planning Strategy ( The 30-Year Plan for Greater Adelaide ) and the South Australian Planning Policy Library template zone modules pursuant to the Development Act . <p> To undertake a Development Plan Amendment the Minister has ultimate control in regard to allowing it to proceed and what is finally approved . This is established via a Statement of Intent that is agreed to at the start of the process . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone is high density development . It is the central heart of Unley and the core activity centre on Unley Road . The surrounding Urban Corridor Zone template policy generally calls for 6 storey development up to 10 storey . In 2013 the City of Unley negotiated an outcome of 5 storey for Unley Road and 7 storey for Greenhill Road . <p> Community consultation on the future for Unley Central and the 2014 Precinct Plan took place in November to December 2015 . During this process , Council received valuable and constructive feedback on subjects such as : <p> land use ; <p> building height ; <p> transport and parking ; <p> amenity ; and <p> the environment . <p> A further hands on stakeholder workshop ( called a Design Lab ) , with residents , owners and local groups , was held in April 2016 to explore potential options for the Precinct . <p> This feedback was considered by the City Strategy and Development Policy ( CSDP ) Committee and by the City of Unley Council through a series of meetings from February 2016 until the draft DPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation on the DPA was conducted from September to in November 2016 and further personal submissions received at a Public Meeting on Tuesday 6 December at the Unley Civic Centre . <p> After comprehensive consideration a Summary of Consultation and Proposed Amendments Report with options for change to key elements was presented to the CSDP Committee on Tuesday 14 March where they voted on the recommendations to be presented to Council for decision at the upcoming March Council meeting . <p> 2014 August - The concepts outlined in the Draft Unley Central Precinct Plan were adopted unanimously by Council as the long term vision for the precinct <p> 2015 Jan City of Unley submits a Statement of Intent to the State Government to amend the Development Plan May Minister approves Statement of Intent to the State Government to amend the Development Plan November Council wide Community consultation on the vision and principals for Unley Central <p> 2016 February Community feedback considered by the CSDP Committee April - Design Lab on DPA ( with a selection of residents and developers ) September DPA consultation December Public hearing <p> 2017 March - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Council March Council votes on way forward at Council meeting April Council reports back to Minister with a proposed way forward <h> Community Land <h> Proposed Development Plan Changes <p> Council will be contributing to the Local Government Association response document .

@@26096962 @6096962/ <h> History of Onkaparinga <p> For thousands of years , the Onkaparinga River slowly carved its way through the surrounding foothills , creating spectacular gorges and fertile wetlands . Around it , the land remained relatively unchanged , sparsely populated by the original inhabitants of the regionthe Kaurna Aboriginal people . The name Onkaparinga ' comes from Ngangkiparinga ' , an indigenous word meaning The Women 's River ' . <p> All this changed with the coming of the first British explorers , surveyors and settlers during the mid-1830s . In December 1836 , South Australia was proclaimed a colony and , by the end of 1838 , its population had grown to over 5000 . These early pioneers rapidly spread out from the original Adelaide settlement , purchasing and developing land across the region . Consequently , the City of Onkaparinga boasts a number of historic townships dating back to the earliest years of white settlement . <p> The first exploratory expedition in South Australia took place in 1837 . It finished in an area the Aborigines referred to as The place of green trees ' . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Shortly afterwards , high-quality slate was discovered there and a slate mining industry quickly sprang up . The legacy of this is still evident today in some of Willunga 's roofs , footpaths , water tanks and bridges . <p> The McLaren Vale township was surveyed in 1839 and settled by farmers from Devonshire , England . Originally , McLaren Vale developed as two separate villagesGloucester and Bellevuewhich eventually merged . The original inhabitants were more interested in growing cereal crops than grapes . Such was their success , a number of flour mills were set up in the district ; however , after a mass exodus of labour to the Victorian gold fields in 1850 , other agricultural industries were trialled such as wine , dried fruit and almonds . <p> Agriculture was also the primary focus in the Noarlunga district , with considerable clearing of native vegetation occurring from 1840 . The township of Old Noarlunga served as a business centre for the region from which produce could be transported down river to Port Noarlunga . <p> One of South Australia 's worst maritime disasters occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece ' was driven ashore at Port Willunga during a severe storm . Few of the crew survived . Many are buried in the historic Aldinga cemetery . The remains of the ship 's iron skeleton are still visible at low tide and prove a popular dive site . Storm damage also destroyed the port facilities at Port Willunga in 1915 . Today , all that remains of this structure are a series of weather-beaten pylons sticking up from the sand like an ancient monument . <p> In time , Adelaide 's suburbs gradually spread south along the coast , with residential housing taking the place of farmland . Considerable rural areas remain , however , with almonds and grapes being among the most successful crops grown . In recent years , a number of commercial olive plantations have also been established , being ideally suited both to the climate and our changing palates . On 1 July 1997 , the City of Onkaparinga was formed out of the former Cities of Happy Valley and Noarlunga and part of the District Council of Willunga , creating the largest council in South Australia .
