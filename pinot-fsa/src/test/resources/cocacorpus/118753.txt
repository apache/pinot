It was work tension , job pressure or just the stress of juggling so many balls that ran the risk of a mini melt down in the later days of 2016 , which was simply your body 's way of getting you to slow down . Yet as they say time and tide waits for no man ' and that is especially so this year , though to start with you do have a quiet patch in the early weeks of the year . You have until the 28th January before things start to take off on the work front , but once they do they will remain busy right through to early June . The lessons you 're able to move into the year with are not that you must cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an extremely opportune year for work and income matters , nor will a need for time to hear yourself think abate . What does have to change is how you work , with working smarter and not so much balancing your time , but prioritising it .

Trust that if you do , the money will follow , though it is less likely to if you stay at a job or work around the clock just for the money . In the lead up to lucky Jupiter 's return to Scorpio on the 10th October and the start of not only a year for major new beginnings , but the start of a new 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion , time to hear yourself think will remain important , with a chance to close old doors . The one thing that you do have working for you in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance between work and play . While the busiest months of 2017 run from late January to early June , the most fun , playful , romantic and creative are already in play and will remain in play until late April . If you 're going to work smarter and maintain the right work/life balance , then a balance between work and play is a good place to start . These are lessons that , if learned in the early months of the year will serve you well throughout the year . The reality is you do need to work smarter , work/life balance is important , as is time to hear yourself think , but you also have a huge year for income , work and career opportunities . You can have it all , but a need for balance begins on Day 1 . <h> Love <p> Starting the year with Mars in your romantic sector you know that things are going to be off to a romantically charged and passionate start . Having returned just before Christmas , Mars has been firing up your romantic passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year , but if you 're looking for omens , then look no further than the early hours of the year . You will not only move into the New Year with Mars and Neptune , the planets of love and passion in your romantic sector , but aligned from New Year 's Eve to the 2nd January . With your romantic passions , dreams and fighting spirit aligned from the get go , it makes it clear that this will be no ordinary year for love . Now the reality is that with Mars leaving on the 28th January , there is a danger that the year could start with a lot of hype and excitement and then fall flat . However , that is not destined to be your fate and it is all because of Venus , planet of love . The first sign that something is up is Venus ' return to your romantic sector on the 3rd January , as far ahead of the Sun as possible . This means Venus will be pulled back and while she will eventually leave on the 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 3rd April to the 28th April . In all Venus will spend just over two months here and considering she will normally move through in just 24 days , that 's a big deal and more than enough to keep Mars ' romantic passions and fighting spirit alive . In retrograde motion from the 3rd April to the 15th April , there is a brief 12 day window of opportunity where the doors will be open to the past and second chances . Between them Venus , Mars and their support crew will make the first five months of 2017 the most romantically charged . It is during that period that things will also start to move on the relationship front , starting with Ceres ' return on the 5th February . This is just days after Venus and Mars ' departure from your romantic sector , with the dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system returning to something she put on hold last October . Having already spent time getting to the heart of what you want from your relationships , Ceres will be here when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a flood of planetary support follows him . With a big chance for relationship building between the 10th March and the 5th July and the most romantically charge months of the year not ending until the 28th April , there will be an overlap between the two . <h> Money <p> Like a farmer that has spent long days planting his fields and can finally sit back and let Mother Nature do its part , much of what you will acquire this year comes from the hard work already invested , from where you have already believed in yourself and more importantly , where you have chosen never to give up . As Saturn moves into his third and final year in your income sector , he will have already required and lot from you . With the endurance to see anything through , the power to move mountains if you have to and the refusal to give up on what you deserve , all you 've got to do now is wait for this to bear fruit . Surprisingly , any income growth this year will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods or from two in particular , Venus and Mars . Much of this year 's income potential has already been invested or it is there as untapped potential , so it 's more a case of waiting for the right professional conditions and those conditions will start to open up as early as the end of January . The tide actually turned on the work front in the final days of 2016 , but work tensions and job pressure at the end of last year may have made that hard to spot . It is Mars ' return to your work sector on the 28th January that will set job matters in motion and that is when untapped income potential will get the break it needs . However , the planet to watch is Venus , who while wearing her professional hat is really a money god at heart . The 24 days that Venus spends in your work sector each year can often lead to lucrative outcomes , for it is the case when she moves through , that if you follow your heart the money will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much potential just waiting to be seized , the fact that Venus wo n't just move through is a game changer . Venus will return on the 3rd February but wo n't leave until the 3rd April and even then , will return for a double dip visit from the 28th April to the 6th June . Considering that Venus will normally spend just 24 days in your work sector each year , the over three months she will spend here has the potential to create some of the most lucrative conditions of the year . The main focus this year is definitely income matters , with the final two months of the year a chance to bring everything together . That makes it important to focus on your financial situation and money matters when you get the chance . This will come when a parade of planets move through your financial sector from the 21st April to the 31st July . 4689 @qwx624689 4692 @qwx624692 <h> About Scorpio <p> Scorpio is good at passion .

Beyond the bedroom , Scorpio knows how to make money and influence people to the degree that they can become quite powerful and respected .

Scorpio generates the kind of excitement that draws people like magnets , and give their projects an air of mystery and secrecy . Scorpios are deeply possessive , and like to know everything about a person or enterprise they are involved with . <p> The trouble is , they start to enjoy manipulating , and become ruthless in pursuit of their desires .

This allows you to begin the year with your heart engaged from the get go , a clear sense of what you want and also ready to embrace your passions . Even more important was the chance this gave Venus and therefore your heart , to connect with Jupiter in the final weeks of 2016 , for he is the one planet that will have the biggest influence on the year itself .

That there is something fateful developing on the relationship front is more a dark horse at first , with a lunar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 11th February suggesting that fate is at play , but without really knowing what . It might not be until midyear and until a total solar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 21st August that the hands of fate will be revealed .

With fate seemingly at work on the relationship front this week , this is something Venus must be aware of . To start with Venus will move through your communication sector from the 3rd February to the 3rd April , so will be here during the lunar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 11th August . However , she will then return for a double dip visit from the 28th April to the 6th June .

Moving into the year with Venus , planet of love not only in Aquarius but here since early December , makes it clear from the get go that this is going to be a romantically charged year , right ? Well , yes this is going to be a good year for matters of the heart , but not in the way that first impressions suggest . With Venus leaving Aquarius on the 3rd January and then not returning 2018 , this may see romantic forces drop back just 72 hours into the year . However , having already spent weeks here before leaving and having spent both Christmas and the New Year in Aquarius , this is simply when the trainer wheels come off . In reality , where there is something super special and fateful developing this year is on the relationship front .

Things will start moving on the romantic front with Mars ' return to your romantic sector on the 1st April and while Venus wo n't return until the 5th July , there will be plenty of support to keep the romantic flame burning until she gets here . In fact , that whole period from the 21st April to the 31st July is the most romantically charged period of the year , with the first six weeks and the last four weeks the best . It is while this is still unfolding that whatever fate has in store on the relationship front will start stirring , starting with Mercury 's return to your relationship sector on the 6th July .

However , while Venus will move through from the 3rd January to the 3rd February , already staying on a week longer than she normally would , she will return for a rare double dip visit from the 3rd April to the 28th April . With Venus ' early weeks spent with Mars and Neptune and a solar eclipse on the 26th February , just weeks after her departure , the first four months of 2017 are a fertile field for income opportunities .

As you open the door to 2017 and take your first look at the year and journey ahead , you 'll gain much by looking back at the previous 12 days . For the first time in 12 years you 're moving into the New Year with Jupiter in your home and family sector , making this a big , important and expansive year for home , family and/or property matters and from the get go this has to be a priority . Yet in the final 12 days of December Jupiter moved into opposition with Uranus in your career sector , bringing work/life balance tensions and issues to a head , something that will take weeks into the New Year to ease back . With work/life balance in your face from the get go and lucky Jupiter making this such an important year for home and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional forces in their place . Wrong . For it was over the exact same time that a major alliance between Saturn and Uranus unleashed some of the most powerful forces to come together on the job and career fronts in decades . In a nutshell , this sums up 2017 for you , a year of major career and job growth , something that will continue throughout the year , but will be off the chart during the first half of the year . Yet at the same time this is a huge year for home , family and/or property matters , with work/life balance an issue that will dog you throughout the year if you do n't take it seriously from the get go . The advantage this gives you , is that you have this year sussed from the get go , aware of the opportunities and the challenges and therefore how to solve them . This will definitely be worth your while and you will benefit from any sacrifices or compromises you are forced to make . Jupiter is the planet of luck and expansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for home , family and/or property matters and you do n't want , nor do you have to sacrifice that . However , this is n't just a huge year for job and career matters , there are clues that this is likely to be a lucrative year as well . A lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 11th February and a total solar eclipse on the 21st August suggest there is hidden gold this year , for eclipses are only ever the tips of an iceberg , with much of the potential underneath the surface . With so much unfolding on the job and career fronts , that untapped income potential has plenty of support . From the get go get used to a balance between work and play , for with your luckiest year for love , matters of the heart and all things fun , playful , romantic and creative in over a decade beginning in October , there needs to be room in your life for this . <h> Love <p> This year just has to be the best kept secret ever , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring . This was more hints from the universe that the romantic drought was getting ready to break and while it might not be any time soon , that you needed to be prepared . There is no way to prepare you for what 's coming unless I break the secret , which is that your luckiest year for love and romance is on the way and will begin on the 10th October and run through to November 2018 . That gives you over nine months to prepare and that means no room for excuses or shying away from what lies ahead . Of course the Moon 's monthly visits to your romantic sector will act as a trail of breadcrumbs , leading you to what lies ahead , the biggest chance to prepare will be during Venus , planet of love 's return to Cancer from the 31st July to the 26th August . While that might seem a life time away and returning after your birthday month is over and therefore much later in the year than she normally would , when you 're preparing for something this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through after your birthday month is over , means you will have a chance to focus exclusively on updating your romantic desires and expectations , without the distractions of all the mundane resolutions that the Sun requires . While the Moon 's monthly visits to your romantic sector will give you a sense of direction , the most important of those visits will be in May , a visit that will produce a Full Moon on the 10th May . Coincidently , this falls exactly five months to the day before lucky Jupiter 's return , providing one of the clearest road signs of the year , pointing in the right direction . Once the romantic drought breaks on the 10th October expect a torrent , with every available love god moving through between then and the 26th January 2018 . With the flotilla of support during the first four months of this lucky year for love , look forward to a well supported start . December 2017 will also usher in something major on the relationship front as well , with Saturn 's return to your relationship sector on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for relationship building in three decades . Something is definitely happening in the final three months of the year , giving you the majority of the year to prepare . The focus will always be on your relationships in the early and later months of every year and with the Sun in your relationship sector until the 19th January and Mercury until the 7th February , this will give you a clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you . However , this is nothing compared to what is developing in December . <h> Money <p> 2017 should be a good year for money matters , with the financial confidence you 're moving into the year with well justified . There could be a sense that you 're onto a winning streak that must sooner or later bottom out , except this has nothing to do with the amount of money you have coming in or how much money you have in your bank and more a sense of being in control of your own financial destiny . You are a Sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a few lucky breaks from the stars and you 're on your way . You got those lucky breaks in the final two months of 2016 , allowing you to move into 2017 with your financial confidence high and your financial desires , passions and fighting spirit already fuelled . Yet from such a confident start you have some very ordinary forces to work with and it wo n't be until February that there will be any indication of where that unshakable sense of financial confidence is really coming from . This comes in the form of a lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 11th February . It 's not just that as an eclipsing Full Moon this is destined to be more fruitful than an ordinary Full Moon or the implications behind it and more when it falls . To have a lunar eclipse fate has to be in play and with three out of this year 's four eclipses falling in your two money houses and two in your income sector that is definitely the case .

It is within that period that you 'll have two New Moons in your income sector , the first on the 23rd July and the second on the 21st August , but it 's the second New Moon that is also a total solar eclipse , creating the potential for major new income opportunities . It is also within that same period that the third eclipse will fall , this time in your financial sector on the 7th August .

Returning just three days before Jupiter turns retrograde on the 6th February and leaving just three days before he turns direct on the 9th June , a financial review period and some of the most lucrative months in a decade overlap .

Why then , if you 're moving into such a potentially lucrative year , with lucky Jupiter on your side for the first time in 12 years , should you be feeling under pressure ?

It always has and it always will do . However , simply putting the spotlight on matters of the heart does n't really tell you what kind of year to expect , for there have been some years where you do n't particularly like what you see .

The reality is , two major alliances in the final weeks of the 2016 have woken you up to not only your potential , but to your true relationship with money matters . It was an opposition between lucky Jupiter in your income sector and Uranus in your financial sector , that brought the biggest clash between money coming in and money going out in eight decades , blowing away false facades and leaving your true needs , values and aspirations exposed .

It is n't always easy having Saturn , hard taskmaster of the cosmos in your sign , but boy does this give you the power to move mountains if you have to . Due to leave on the 20th December and not return for another three decades , this is the year when you will get to enjoy the benefits of the past few years , with a chance to see where that sense of empowerment can take you and what you can do with it . This gives you the confidence to take on major new projects and challenges of your choosing , calling for some bold , but also some very personal resolutions from the get go . This is the thread that will run throughout the year and you can take with you into every aspect of your life . One thing that will be especially important in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things fun , playful , romantic and creative . This is something you may have had some wakeup calls about in the closing weeks of 2016 , waking you up to what is important . To begin with it may simply feel like the tide has turned , but from last January through to early June you 'll be ready to throw yourself into following your heart and the things you 're passionate about . This makes this a big year for matters of the heart , but also for following your personal pursuits or hobbies , the things in life that are fun . When it comes to working yourself into the ground , you have been there and done that and are likely to have lost your taste for that . Just as well , because you have more than enough momentum . There are more than enough job opportunities , especially between March and July and plenty of career opportunities developing in the second half of the year , but not in the all or nothing way that they have been in the past . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your personal life got what was left over , that does a complete flip this year . The first four months of 2017 are also especially good for home , family and/or property matters , with a chance to not only take care of any housekeeping , but to explore new projects or the things that excite you . This should see you finally achieve the work/life balance you 've strived for in the past and the balance between work and play you did n't even know you were after . <h> Love <p> While you will have to wait until the 1st December for Venus , planet of love to return to Sagittarius , her influence has helped shape the year before it even began and she will be hard at work long before then . Moving through Sagittarius from the 1st December to the 25th December , this will be more a chance to sum up what is likely to be an extraordinary year , with 2017 one of your best years for love and romance for a very long time . To start with you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have experienced some roadblocks or just a crisis of confidence in the later weeks of 2016 . Yet from the get go it is likely to feel like something has shifted , with the love gods having given you a chance to lay old ghosts to rest . It was only in the final 48 hours of 2016 that you finally had a chance to turn your back on the past and look to the future . While there will be a new sense of romantic confidence and anticipation from the get go , the first evidence will come in the later days of January . It starts with Mars ' return to your romantic sector on the 28th January , but really gets exciting when Venus , planet of love returns on the 3rd February . While Mars will spend until the 10th March fuelling your romantic passions and fighting spirit and then moving on , it is Venus who is up to something special . The 24 days that Venus will normally spend in your romantic sector each year will be the most romantically charged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months . Venus will initially move through from the 3rd February to the 3rd April , but having already spent two months here , will retrograde back into your romantic sector for a double dip visit from the 28th April to the 6th June . Venus will spend half of her first visit in direct and half in retrograde motion , with the doors open to the past , second chances and untapped potential from the 4th March to the 3rd April . From Mars ' return to your romantic sector on the 28th January to Venus ' departure on the 6th June , they and the support crew there at the time , will make these some of the most romantically charged months in decades . Meanwhile , while your relationships will share the same attention , starting with Mars ' return on the 21st April and ending with Venus ' departure on the 31st July , she wo n't return until the 5th July . Together Venus and Mars are having a huge impact on both matters of the heart and your relationships in the first seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sagittarius on the 1st December , you 'll have a lot to reflect on . <h> Money <p> That the focus is on income matters in the early part of each year is a given , due to the fact that the Sun will always spend the first three weeks of January in your income sector each year . The fact that this is n't as intense as it normally is , is more that most things are already in the bag . Both Venus and Mars moved through your income sector in the closing months of 2016 and with a clear sense of what you 're fighting for and most glass ceilings already smashed , especially those in your own mind , the early weeks of 2017 will be more about tying up loose ends . The Sun will stay on until the 20th January , keeping the solar spotlight on your income situation , matters and options , before returning again on the 21st December to do it all over again . Mercury will start the year in your income sector , giving you the smart head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the get go , but will take a break from the 5th January to the 13th January .

This is when you 'll have a chance to finalise your game plan for the coming year and put together the choices , decisions and plans that will keep income matters on track . For the most part it will be more about keeping the wheels turning . Fortunately for you , you have Pluto in your income sector from 2008 to 2026 , so things will never completely go off the boil . This also means that there wo n't be a moment throughout the year , where there is n't something developing behind the scenes on the income front . It is later in the year that this turns into something utterly game changing , thanks to Saturn 's return on the 20th December , just two days before the Sun 's return . This will be Saturn 's first visit in three decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be some of the most powerful earnings and income years ever . For while Saturn will spend three years out of every three decades here , this is the first time he will meet up with Pluto , planet of change and revolution here in your lifetime .

Compared to what is developing on the income front this year , the focus on your financial situation and money matters as well is minimal and runs the risk of being overlooked . A parade of planets will move through your financial sector from 4th June to the 26th August , making these the most important months of 2017 for getting on top of your financial situation and money matters . With Pluto in retrograde motion from the 21st April to the 29th September , this is when income matters will take a backseat anyway , allowing you to give money matters as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> About Sagittarius <p> Sagittarius is good at having fun .

Chances are the final weeks of 2016 were stressful , putting pressure on your relationships and just generally feeling the kind of pressure you have n't experienced before . However , before you protest rest assured , this wo n't follow you into the New Year and if anything , this has already proved cathartic . The main problem was an opposition between Jupiter and Uranus , over in your relationship sector , with one thinking your needs should come first and the other that your relationships should come first . This is the first time this has happened here in eight decades and that it should happen just as you 're about to move into your biggest year for personal growth in over a decade , has to be seen as an opportunity for a major breakthrough . That is especially so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance between the communication and relationship gods also peaked , giving you all the resources needed to turn this into an opportunity for a major breakthrough . Any tensions will drop off dramatically in the New Year , though January might be a busy month for you . It was developments that began on the home front in the final months of 2016 that need to be finalised , though these will be mainly sorted by early February at the latest . What is likely to take you by surprise is the almost dream start you have on the job front , how quickly things are set to take off and how much opportunity there is . A period of job growth began in the days leading up to Christmas but will extend right out to late April . This will make up for either the challenging or hard times on the work front over the last few years , with a lot more job growth and a lot less challenges . If this does n't bear immediate fruit it will do once Jupiter returns to your career sector on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income growth in over a decade , a year that will extend out to late 2018 . In the meantime , something special is happening on the relationship front , putting the wakeup calls late last year into perspective . It is Venus and Mars , the planets of love and passion that are leading the charge into something special on the relationship front , during a period that begins on the 28th January and extends out to the 6th June . Throughout that time and right through to the 20th December , you will have the support of Saturn , in his third and final year in your communication sector . <h> Love <p> The biggest danger you face as you move into the New Year is complacency , assuming that Venus , who leaves on the 3rd January will return again later in the year . After all , she has been here since early December 2016 , so you 're right to assume that she 'll return later in the year , right ? Wrong . Venus will spend less than 72 hours of 2017 in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , wo n't return until 2018 . While the Sun will move through your romantic sector from the 21st January to the 19th February and Mercury from the 7th February to the 26th February , once they are gone all you will have are the Moon 's monthly visits to keep the romantic flame burning . I do n't say to disappoint you , rather to urge you to hold onto the considerable romantic influence you move into the year with . Mars only left on the 19th December 2016 and having spent the previous six weeks fuelling your romantic passions and fighting spirit , it wo n't take much to keep that flame fuelled . At the same time , while Venus may leave on the 3rd January and not return until 2018 , like a bell that ca n't be un-rung , starting the year with the planet of love holding your hand , is going to put the year on a romantically charged course from the get go . Your job is to keep that romantic flame burning and to work with the Sun and Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel this into something concrete . There are two reasons why Venus is n't spending a lot of time in your romantic sector this year . The first reason is you do n't need her , with the romantic flame you start the year with very easy to maintain . The second reason is that Venus is giving your relationships a lot of attention this year . While Venus will spend less than three days of 2017 in your romantic sector , she will spend over three months in your relationship sector . Normally Venus will spend just 24 days working her magic on your relationships . Instead , Venus will return on the 3rd February and wo n't leave until the 3rd April , two months later and even then , will return for a double dip visit from the 28th April the 6th June . Within that period is a month long period , from the 4th March to the 3rd April , when in retrograde motion Venus will hold the doors open to the past and second chances .

Those of you canny enough to have your finger on the pulse and ear to the ground , will sense that this is the year that your boat will finally come in . It will , but not until the later part of the year , though there may be small signs that things are shifting before then . To start with , with no planetary activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on having your work hat on and that would have been the case regardless .

It is a Full Moon in your income sector on the 10th May , just 12 days after Venus ' departure that will bring your first real chance to reap the rewards . The key factor about the amount of time that Venus will spend in your work sector this year , is that as a money god at heart , where she is concerned , where the heart leads the money will follow .

Venus and Mars knew this when they are firing things up on the job front in the early months of the year , making it even more important to follow your heart and embrace the things you 're passionate about . Your financial situation and money matters will get their turn when a parade of planets move through your financial sector from the 10th March to the 5th July .

It has been 12 years since you last moved into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in your career sector and with your biggest year for professional growth and expansion stretching out until October and then support to bring things home in play through to December , you 're right to assume this is going to be a professionally focused year . However , it is also clear from the get go that this is an important year for home , family and/or property matters . How important is likely to take you by surprise , with some opportune developments continuing to unfold from late January through to early June . Even if there are no big changes during that time , home will be where the heart is and your home life or lifestyle will be especially important . Any work/life balance issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standoff between planets that know just what 's possible on the home and professional fronts this year and are committed to finding the right balance from the get go . This does n't have to be an important year for home and family matters or for professional growth , with every reason why you should enjoy both . On paper , this does n't appear to be a particularly game changing year for either income or money matters , but with three of this year 's eclipses falling in your two money houses , it appears something is happening behind the scenes . Eclipses appear random and bring unexpected fateful developments , but they are in fact the tips of icebergs , with forces behind the scenes in play all along . With a lunar eclipse in your financial sector on the 11th February , a total solar eclipse on the 21st August and a lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 7th August , this should be an important year for both income and money matters .

This is important , for this is when you get a chance to define your romantic and relationship desires and expectations for the coming year . The last time you moved into the New Year with Venus already been and gone was in 2012 and that is the case this year as well . As was the case four years ago , this means moving into the New Year always knowing what you want from love and your relationships , which can be a mixed blessing .

However , your heart never forgets , with a need to assume that as long as you follow your heart from the get go , you ca n't go wrong . The Moon 's monthly visit to both your romantic and relationship sectors will also play an important role in pointing things in the right direction , starting a Full Moon in your relationship sector on the 12th January . This is a Full Moon that will always fall at some point during your birthday month , so either in the later days of December or the early weeks of January . This is a chance to put your personal and relationship needs into conflict , in order to get a better sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you . In the meantime , while the Sun wo n't return to your romantic sector on the 19th April , something will start stirring as early as the 5th February . For the rest of February this is likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this will erupt into the real thing when Mars returns to your romantic sector on the 10th April , where he 'll continue to fire up your romantic passions and fighting spirit until leaving on the 21st April . By then a romantic chapter will be well underway and will continue until Venus returns to bring things home , between the 6th June and the 5th July . It is during the final month of this romantic chapter that something will start to stir on the relationship front , starting with Mars ' return to your relationship sector on the 4th June . The same planets that got together to make the period from the 10th March to the 5th July so special , will come together to make the period from the 4th June to the 26th August just as special on the relationship front . It is that period where the two overlap , from the 4th June to the 5th July , that you 'll find the best conditions for both matters of the heart and your relationships of the year . <h> Money <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3rd January and will spend less than 72 hours of 2017 here , means nothing , for the die will have been caste by then . Starting the year with the planet of money , desire and attraction in your income sector is going to give your financial year a dream start and while she will leave you after just a few days , this is like starting the year with a treasure map . She might take the map with her when she leaves , but like a bell that ca n't be un-rung , you ca n't un-see what you 've seen . This will also mean you start the year with a strong sense of confidence and entitlement , something that you will retain for as long as you nurture it . Mars only left just before Christmas , so you 've had a chance to smash through some glass ceilings , especially those in your own mind . Once Venus leaves there will be a chance to let things settle , but by the time the Sun returns to throw the solar spotlight on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll already have a head start . The planetary activity that will play out over the course of January and February is both normal for this time of year and very low key . The Sun will move through from the 20th January to the 19th February and Mercury will move through from the 7th February to the 25th February , bringing the smart head for money needed to get your head in the game . Yet this very ordinary start is set to have extraordinary consequences , with the money gods leaving you with everything you need to turn this into a ridiculously lucrative year . The only reason this is possible is that you will also move into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in your career sector and not due to leave until October , 2017 is your biggest year for professional growth and expansion in over a decade . Starting the year with Venus , planet of money in your income sector and lucky Jupiter in your career sector , is a dream start , one that is giving this powerful professional year a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 7th August could also trigger some unexpected breakthroughs . In the meantime , while there is not a lot of focus on your financial situation and money matters as a whole , a lunar eclipse in your financial sector on the 11th February and a total solar eclipse on the 21st August suggests there is something strong beating behind the scenes . While the main timeframe to focus on money matters as a whole will be from the 20th September , there will be signs from early May that money matters are starting to flow more easily and naturally . This is the point when both income and financial matters will find a favourable wind , one that will continue to blow in a positive direction for the rest of this year and well into 2018. 4689 @qwx624689 4692 @qwx624692 <h> About Capricorn <p> A Capricorn is good at making money .

@@73187039 @1887039/ <h> 2017 Overview <p> While starting the year with Venus in your relationship sector is giving your relationships a boost from the get go , the fact that she 'll leave on the 3rd January and that your annual relationship review will be over by the end of February , suggests this is nothing but a good start . Knowing what you want from your relationships from the get go is obviously an advantage , but a lunar eclipse here on the 7th August suggests that fate is in play this year . Eclipses might appear random but they are not and like the tips of an iceberg , there real influence is taking place behind the surface . What this does encourage you to do from the get go , is to make the most of the fact that you have lucky Jupiter in your communication sector until the 10th October and then ongoing support from the communication gods right through to December . You might not know why it 's important to have the communication lines open , but you do need to make the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that something fateful is building on the relationship front , there will also be a call to be true to yourself , with a chance this year to come into your own , able to take your own power back . This is going to expose any balance issues between your personal and relationship needs and if they do move into conflict , there could be some personal and/or relationship tension . Yet with the communication lines open , the scene is set for some major breakthroughs this year . What you will find from the get go is that life is not so busy and hectic , both compared to the early months of each year and the later months of 2016 . It 's as though the professional gods are letting you off the hook , allowing you to cruise and focus more on keeping the wheels turning . In reality , your biggest , busiest and most potentially game changing three years on the work front ever , kicks off on the 20th December and wo n't run its course until December 2020 . While this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mainly play out over the course of 2018 , 2019 and 2020 , throughout the year this is something you are building and working towards . If the professional gods are letting you off the hook and allowing for a much quieter pace for much of the year , it is so you can get ready for what lies ahead . <h> Love <p> With Saturn in your romantic sector since December 2014 there is unlikely to be any surprises and with Mars having spent more time here in 2016 than in any other year in two decades , you should have a clear sense of what you 're fighting for . This should n't bother you too much then , that the flotilla of support that will often linger into the early weeks of each year is n't there . That 's because the love gods threw every available resource at you in 2016 and it 's now time to take the trainer wheels off . Mercury will retrograde back in for a double dip visit from the 5th January to the 13th January and retrograding back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart a voice and to put heart and mind on the same page , but give the past and unsaid words a voice . In retrograde motion until the 8th January , the doors will be open to the past and second chances for just three days , from the 5th January to the 8th January . Yet considering Saturn is not leaving your romantic sector until the 20th December and this is the year for laying down the foundations and making the commitments that matters of the heart will follow for decades to come , this is also a chance to lay any old ghosts to rest . Until a Full Moon in your romantic sector on the 9th June and Venus moves through Leo , from the 26th August to the 20th September , Saturn will keep matters of the heart on track , asking that you take responsibility and remain accountable . While Saturn is the hard taskmaster of the cosmos , if there are to be any challenges , after two years here already you will know about them by now . This year is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two years into practice . Mercury , who retrogrades back in for a double dip visit in early January , will return on the 5th November , beginning what will be some of the most powerful romantic months of this year , if not in decades . It is then that the planets will return to help make Saturn 's final weeks count . Saturn will leave on the 20th December and with Venus , planet of love in your romantic sector from the 1st December to the 25th December , his final weeks will be the best . Yet , while a powerful romantic year will take all year to unfold , on the relationship front everything is happening in the early months . Mars only left your relationship sector in December , so you 'll move into the year knowing what you 're fighting for . However Venus , planet of love and guardian of your relationships can do better than that , for having spent Christmas in your relationship sector , she 'll be here as you move into the New Year . While Venus will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 , a year that with her at the wheel is going to point your relationships in the right direction from the get go . From then until Mercury 's departure on the 25th January it is more about the relationship housekeeping required to ensure the communication lines are open and your relationships are on the course they will continue on . <h> Money <p> You wo n't have to wait long to know what kind of financial year this is going to be , for you should have a good sense of this from the get go . You will not only move into the year with Mars and Neptune , the planets of passion and dreams in your financial sector , but aligned from New Year 's Eve to the 2nd January . In a year that starts with your financial dreams and passions aligned from the get go , literally giving you a dream start , you can only expect good things and you 'll be right . With Mars not leaving until the 28th January and Venus returning on the 3rd January , together with Neptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial dreams , desires and passions together , boosting your confidence and providing the kind of motivation that will keep you going all year . With the Sun not returning to begin your annual financial review until the 18th February and Mercury not returning with the smart head for money needed to get your head in the game until the 25th February , there is no need to get real until Venus and Mars have moved on . However , while Mars wo n't return until later next year , once he leaves on the 28th January , while Venus will leave on the 3rd February , she will return for a double dip visit from the 3rd April to the 28th April . With the Sun and Mercury been and gone by then , this will give Venus a chance to return after your annual financial review and after you 've finalised your financial game plan , making sure they have n't analysed too much of the passion and confidence out of the equation . You eventually need to get real in order to turn desires into reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you moved into the year with . Where Venus and Mars met up in your financial sector in January , they will also meet up in your income sector in the second half of the year , part of a team that will create the most potentially lucrative months of 2017 . Those months are from Mercury 's return to your income sector on the 25th July until Mars ' departure on the 22nd October , with September and October the most potentially lucrative and profitable months of 2017 . Another opportune time for income opportunities will be around the time of a Full Moon in your income sector on the 12th March . While all Full Moons in your income sector have the potential to be lucrative , with Mars returning to your career sector on the 10th March , there will be some extra professional support this year . 4689 @qwx624689 4691 @qwx624691 <h> About Leo <p> Leo is good at being warm hearted , generous and kind .

The Venus in Cancer needs to learn to be a little selfish and put themselves first more often to actually have better love relationships with people . <p> Venus in Leo : This is a sign for many with slight to extreme exhibitionist tendencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Leos simply love to show off .

@@73187043 @1887043/ <h> 2017 Overview <p> While you will always move into the year wearing your professional hats , due to the fact that the Sun will always spend the first three weeks of January in your career sector each year , you should n't find this too onerous this year . There is a lot of built up momentum that will ensure you have more than enough traction to get your professional year off the ground , but without the demands this has on other areas of your chart , namely your relationships . While January and February will be the best months of 2017 for friendship and relationship building , it is relationship building that will carry through and will only become stronger as the year progresses . Both personal and professional relationship building will remain the driving force throughout the year , but it is the first two and the final three months of the year that will be the most important . Another reason that you wo n't be keen to see life become all work and no play , is the fact that there seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things fun , playful , romantic and creative . While this is subtle , the fact that you have a lunar eclipse on the 11th February and a total solar eclipse on the 21st August , both in a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart , suggests something is going on . Eclipses are like the tips of icebergs and while they can present as unexpected and fateful developments , if you 're paying attention then there is always something in play , behind the scenes . With Saturn spending his third and final year in your sector of adventure , travel , learning and discovery , when taken as a whole 2017 is a year where there is enough professional momentum to keep the wheels turning , but this is a year for embracing your life head on . While money matters will become more important in the final months of the year , the main driving force in play this year suggests less work , more play , more travel and more time for matters of the heart and your relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on offer Venus , planet of love is dishing out some of her own special magic this year and she has an eye on you . Normally spending just 24 to 26 days in Aries each year , the planet of love will return to update your romantic and relationship desires and expectations , but also to stand by your side to help attract everything you desire . Normally moving through during your birthday month or slightly ahead or behind , the fact that Venus will return on the 3rd February is the first sign that something is up . Instead of moving through Venus will slow down and on the 4th March , just over a month after arriving she will turn retrograde . This will open the door to a magical month , a month where the planet of love will retrace her steps , all the while keeping the doors open to the past and second chances . By the time Venus retrogrades back out on the 3rd April she will have been in Aries for exactly two months , half in direct and half in retrograde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will return to start over , with a double dip visit from the 28th April to the 6th June . One reason I can see for Venus ' exceptionally long visit , is that with Jupiter in your relationship sector until the 10th October , this is putting a lot of focus on your relationships , bringing a chance to advocate for your own needs . However , with a lunar eclipse in your romantic sector on the 11th February Venus ' mandate is a romantically charged one . Even before returning to your sign and the time she will take off between visits , will be spent fuelling a sense of romantic nostalgia . This is over and above a romantic chapter from early July to late September , one that includes a fateful total solar eclipse on the 21st August . While there will be a lot of focus on your relationships all year , this will become a lot more important when the Sun returns to your relationship sector on the 22nd September . Between then and the 9th December , a parade of planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year home .

Apart from a Full Moon in your financial sector on the 10th May , all the focus this year is on income matters . The reality is that this is par for the course and it is more what transpires in October that is out of the ordinary . What is set to transpire is lucky Jupiter 's return to your financial sector on the 10th October , kicking off your biggest year for money matters and your most expansive year for financial growth in over a decade . Because Jupiter is the first planet to return this year there will be no slow build up , one minute you 're on your own and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will stay that way through to November 2018 . However , within days of Jupiter 's return help will start flooding in , starting with Mercury 's return just a week later , giving you the smart head for money needed to get your head in the game and around the huge options opening up . With the Sun returning on the 23rd October , Venus on the 7th November and Mars on the 9th December , once the things start to move on the financial front , you 'll have all the support in the world . While this will all take place in the final three months of the year and will extend well into 2018 , this is something to get excited about , giving you months to explore your options . This also buys you time to focus on income matters , with the first half of the year likely to be the most lucrative .

If you are n't compatible astrologically , the chances are good that you might be a good match for now , but not for life . <p> Keep in mind that all compatibility observations are made from sun signs , and a true match can only really be discovered if you have a proper chart done . General sun sign compatibility is useful if you have just met someone and you want a general idea of where the relationship is going . <p> Aries Those born under the sign of the ram are very ambitious and tenacious . Their extreme focus on their careers can often lead to a neglect of their loved ones , and they need someone who can manage this sort of situation easily . They are passionate and ardent lovers , but they can be flighty in their passions .

They are stable , balanced , and conservative . Having an aversion to debt , Taurus will try to keep the family accounts stable and will most definitely freak out about money at some point in your relationship . They are also not given to experimentation or straying too far from the homefront . <p> Best Matches : Taurus , Cancer , Virgo , Capricorn , Pisces <p> Worst Matches : Leo , Sagittarius , Aquarius <p> Gemini Geminis are chameleons who will change their needs to match those of their partners . As such they make excellent pairings with the more " dominant " signs such as Aries and Leo , but fail with partners who may need their help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissive , they are eager to please and love without reserve . Their main drawback is the " oh , look , a butterfly " mentality - if you are not present in their area of experience , you will soon fall out of favor . <p> Geminis are also notoriously hard to read and you 'll need to be blunt and tell them how you feel about them in order for them to clue in . While extremely intelligent and capable , Geminis have a habit of missing what is in front of them . <p> Best Matches : Aries , Leo , Libra , Aquarius <p> Worst Matches : Scorpio , Capricorn , Pisces <p> Cancer The romantic personality of the Cancer is probably best illustrated by the most famous of them all - Henry VIII .

Cancer is best with more submissive signs like Taurus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire sign .

They will not notice if you come home sulking after a hard day at the office - you will need to be blunt with them about your emotions as Leos are not ones for subtlety . Leos have a habit of making the object of their affections feel like they are the most important people in the world - besides Leo .

@@73187047 @1887047/ <h> Rising Signs <p> Many people study astrology to learn more about themselves and others . It is quite interesting to learn about one 's rising sign in their chart . The rising sign can tell us many things , but most importantly , it tells us about the persona that we present to the outside world . This more than any other part of our sun sign astrology chart is how the world first sees us . <p> If you were to ask people in a poll , they would most likely describe you or your loved ones using characteristics from your rising sign when they first met you . Those that know a little about astrology may automatically assume that they can " tell " your astrology sign from your persona . But those who truly know astrology know to look deeper . They know that they have merely met your face to the outside world and not the true " you " deep inside . <p> It can be quite interesting when people have rising signs and sun signs that are not traditionally harmonious . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Typically what this means is that when people first meet you , they develop one opinion of you and as they get to know you they develop another , more true opinion of exactly who you are . <p> When rising signs and sun signs are more complementary , they can mesh together and there can be much less difference between the two . An example of a great difference could be someone with a rising sign in Leo and a sun sign in Pisces . A rising sign in Leo would make them bold , confident and someone who sought out the spotlight . Their outside persona would certainly be likeable and quite the confident type of person everyone wants to meet . The Pisces sun sign goes a bit deeper in their chart . As a Pisces sun sign , this person is sensitive , psychic and creative . Sometimes this person may have a tendency to isolate themselves . Listening to these descriptions , these certainly sound like two different people ! So getting to know someone that came on like gangbusters but was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to themselves -- this would be someone where the rising sign and sun sign showed you two different people at first . <p> Many people also show some physical characteristics of their rising sign . Each astrological sign is known for some physical attributes . We all look so different that it is easy to see that these physical attributes manifest differently in everyone . A Cancer is known for having beautiful hands and a lovely complexion . If you have this sign as your sun sign or your rising sign , you might have one or even both of these characteristics . The Libras are known for being beautiful -- even if they are not conventionally beautiful when you look at them . Libra is a sign of great charm , so it would make sense that the Libra would give anyone beauty physically and as a personality characteristic . Your physical appearance often has a variety of traits from both your rising and sun signs . <p> Aries Rising : Confident and at times a bit aggressive . Likes sporting events and other competitions . Loves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the very center of the social group . Physically the Aries is often medium height or even stocky and has quite an athletic build . They are much more graceful than they look . <p> Taurus Rising : Known for loving beauty and being a collector of lovely things . Even if a Taurus has a modest income , they have a beautiful home and a gorgeous wardrobe . The Taurus has a very sensuous personality , loving to experience each of the senses . They are an excellent dancer and also a gourmet cook . Physically the Taurus tends to be petite and have delicate bone structure . They have excellent skin and great flexibility . <p> Gemini Rising : You can always tell a Gemini because they can have a sparkling conversation with a parking meter ! Witty , charming and forever the social butterfly . The Gemini is the natural public relations pro or even the politician . They know everyone and also know how to connect them to their needs . People draw to Geminis like the moths to flames . But Geminis are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people get too close ! A Gemini will dress in the latest fashions not simply because they love to be in style , but especially to have something to talk about at the water cooler or the cocktail party . Physically Geminis are tall and slender . They tend to be slightly pale and have a lot of nervous energy . <p> Cancer Rising : They say that the Cancers are " the mothers of the zodiac " and this is not quite true . Oh , Cancer is a very nurturing sign . But they do n't want to nurture everyone . They do however want to improve everyone ! You can count on your fellow Cancer family members , friends and coworkers to nag you gently ( and sometimes not so gently ) to quit smoking , go on that diet , find a better job or to finally get married . Its not that they do n't think you 're perfect -- you are ! They just want to see you happy -- they way they think you should live your life . Cancers are kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer things in life . They 'd rather save their money for a rainy day . Physically Cancers are often medium height and curvy or muscular . They have lovely hands and beautiful skin . <p> Leo Rising : The Leo is the star of the zodiac . These folks love to draw attention to themselves . They are the top salesperson in the office , the best house on the block , the best pie at the state fair and the girl with the cutest dimples at school . They 'll be glad to " top " you at just about anything -- and often they do . But you simply have to love these Leos , even as they show off their fabulous selves . They have deeply generous hearts and would give you the silk shirt off their backs if you needed it . They write big fat checks to charity , even if they do brag about it a little too much . Physically Leos are a little shorter than they 'd like but they always seem to have a gorgeous mane of hair . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising : You know you have a Virgo in your life because they are always dependable and they are the person that walks into your life first when the crisis hits . You 'll often find Virgos in the first-responder type of jobs : police , fire , emergency services positions . You 'd think Aries or Leo would beat them out for it . But Virgos are all about service . Many Virgos become teachers too . Caring for other people is important to them in ways that other signs do n't completely understand : it is a true mission . Virgos are also known for keeping things organized and spotless . You can actually eat off of a floor a Virgo has cleaned . But do n't : they 'd probably strangle you for getting it dirty again . They are a bit fussy at times . Then again , they are busy saving the world so you have to forgive them . Physically Virgos are tall and thin with bright cheeks and dark hair . <p> Libra Rising : It almost is n't fair , but every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look classically beautiful . They have wonderful skin and charming dimples . Libras have loads of charm and they totally know how to use that to their best advantage . Each one of them channels some sort of inner southern belle most of the time . They bat their eyes and get the best tables and parking tickets just go away . Physically Libras are very good looking and are known for having great skin . <p> Scorpio Rising : Scorpio is a sign that is admired for its intensity . If you love passion , you 'll love Scorpio . Some people are afraid of Scorpios because they have heard of them having truly horrid tempers . This is n't quite the whole story . What Scorpios really have is passion . If you get a Scorpio angry : you are going to be on the business end of a whole lot of angry passion . The wise ones only get mad when those that are vulnerable get hurt . Those still learning wind up taking anger management courses . Scorpios are very creative when they channel their passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very muscular . They are quick and light on their feet . <p> Sagittarius Rising : The Sagittarius is most known for their light-hearted and friendly way . You can always tell that there is a Sag in the room because of their great sense of humor , they can make anyone laugh ! Somehow , the Sagittarius always seems taller and larger than they are . They have great natural charisma . They are the type of people that are great with a crowd of people and know how to encourage people to get along . Physically the Sagittarius is most known for having a tremendous amount of energy and for having great teeth . But they can be just about any height or any type of other physical characteristics . You 'll know that Sag because of their great energy level ! <p> Capricorn Rising : Some people are a little afraid of the Capricorns . They have a great reputation for being so very serious . But when you get to know the Capricorn , you realize this is not quite the case . What they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be recognized for their maturity and wisdom that is far beyond their years . The teenagers never seem to miss curfew and the children always brush and floss their teeth . Do n't think your Capricorn does n't know how to have fun : they do . They are just much more rational about their fun than most of us ! Physically the Capricorn is known for having lovely bone structure . They simply look stunning , even the ones that are n't classically beautiful . There are many unique looking Capricorns out there that look just amazing . <p> Aquarius Rising : These are unique folks , that is for sure . Aquarians simply think a little differently than most of us do . That 's why many of them are scientists , artists or engineers . They are creative , in ways that shape our world today and for tomorrow to come . The smart ones realize early that they walk to the beat of a different drum and they hum along to that tune . The ones that have a tougher time are those that try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to . Aquarians do better when they let their freak flag fly . Physically Aquarians often have tall , thin and wiry physiques . They have lots of energy and often have sensitive systems that require very specific diets . You 'll know the Aquarian in the restaurant ordering his hamburger medium well done with a well grain bun . They always have great passion in their eyes and are often musical . <p> Pisces Rising : The Pisces is a sensitive soul . Quite often , a Pisces has a lot of psychic ability , which if they learn how to manage it well can help humanity as well as themselves . Sometimes Pisces are known for trying to get people to feel sorry for them so they 'll do their errands or maybe lend them something till payday . But for the most part Pisces folks use their sensitivity to care for others -- and they do care about everyone , from society to different causes and even the pet rock .

@@73187053 @1887053/ <h> 2017 Chinese Zodiac - Year of the Rooster <p> While the astrology and horoscopes of the west look at the time of a person 's birth in any given year , Chinese astrology places significance on the year itself . The Chinese zodiac is a 60 year cycle , containing five sub-cycles of twelve years , in which each consecutive year has its own animal symbol and horoscope . <h> 2017 Chinese Zodiac - Year of the Rooster <p> When the New Moon on the 28th January ushers in the Year of the Rooster , this sees the energy governing the year change . It is a little like electing a new president or prime minister . All our lives stay the same , the land is under a different ruler and that will have subtle influences . The laws might change and what we can and ca n't do . This wo n't change our lives but it will subtly change the way we go about our lives , as the rulership changes . <p> On the 28th January the Monkey moves aside , making way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's crazy smart , insanely intelligent and a lateral thinker . The Monkey will go for the easiest way out of a tricky situation every time and ca n't think why you would want to do things the hard way . If there 's a short cut the Monkey will find it . <p> This is the energy we have been under since February 2015 and it has taught us all to think on your feet , respond to situations on the fly and in general take a smart , creative and colourful approach to life . Now we have to adjust to living under the Rooster 's influence , one that could n't be more different to the Monkey . <p> The story I most love about the Rooster is one that explains his tendency to worry . The Rooster is the king of the barnyard . He loves to strut his stuff , knowing that nothing happens without his say so or approval . He takes that responsibility seriously , especially when it comes to keeping the chicken coop free from predators . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't crowing at dawn in order to announce to the barnyard that the Sun is up and it 's time to start another busy day . No , the Rooster 's job is much more important . His job is to wake the Sun up , believing that if he did n't get up before dawn and crow , the Sun would n't rise and that would be the end of everything . That is a heavy weight that the Rooster takes on his shoulders . <p> In the Year of the Rooster there will be a tendency to take life and our responsibilities seriously , but also a danger that we could buy into the belief that we are responsible for the rising and setting of the Sun . The Rooster is an industrious and hard working year , a year where you 're able to get a lot done , take on more responsibility and accomplish and acquire a lot . <p> The Rooster also likes bluster . Watch him strut around the barnyard and ward off predators and you 'll see a self assured and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of self importance , but of how seriously the Rooster takes his responsibilities . For all of us there will be a draw to take on more responsibility , not to shirk our duties and to get the job done . <p> In terms of looking at leaders , whether it is our political leaders , our boss at work or other people in power or a leadership position , we will lose faith in those that do n't have that same work ethic . The Rooster does n't mind show ponies , for after all no one struts his features with more flair than a Rooster does , but he backs it up with a strong work ethic . If someone is just a show pony and does n't back that up , he will lose our respect . <p> Yet the Rooster is n't just hard work and responsibility , for when it is deserved , he loves to see us shine . The Rooster does n't just quietly go about protecting the barnyard and calling up the Sun each morning , he makes sure everyone sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put in the hard work and take responsibility , then expect recognition . <p> Unlike the Monkey , who was all about taking as many shortcuts as possible and who prided himself in cutting corners , the Rooster plays by the rules , demanding that you do things the right way . For the Monkey , if there was an easier way he 'd find it and ask why not ' ? The Rooster does n't seek out the harder path , but looks at short cuts and asks why should it ' ? The Rooster knows how much you 're able to learn by doing things the right way . <p> The Rooster hates loose ends . He hates all those bills you have n't got around to paying . He hates those odd jobs around the house you 've been putting off and he hates clutter . From the moment the Rooster arrives he 'll roll up his sleeves and start restoring clutter . <p> This year we have a Fire Rooster and here we have something special . The last time we had a Fire Rooster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of passion , motivation and a need for action . There is a tendency with the Fire Rooster energy to become one eyed , in that once you form an opinion you stick to it , no matter what . Yet so long as you 're aware of that , then you can use this to your advantage in anything that does require you to stick to something once you start . <p> In summary the Rooster is a year where you are likely to get a lot done , mainly by rolling up your sleeves , taking responsibility and sticking to something until the job is done . It is also a year where you 're likely to be recognised for hard work , especially if you 've put in the effort and you do n't give up . There is a need though to avoid taking on so much responsibility that you believe that the Sun and Moon wo n't rise without you . The Rooster believes in playing it by the book and will smile on those that play by the book and the rules as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to by their zodiac animals , so babies born this year will be Rats and expected to have personalities to match . <p> Legend has it that it was originally Buddha who gave the sequence of years to the dozen animals who attended the farewell meeting he called before he left the earth . <p> In each of its years , the animals of the Chinese zodiac have an association with one of the five elements of metal , water , wood , fire or earth . Once they have all gone through these five elements , the 60 year cycle is complete , and starts again . The elements also affect the individuals born in their years . But their basic personality traits of the animals remain the same . Here is a run down of the twelve zodiac animals and their characteristics . <p> From all this , you can see that Chinese Zodiac is not a predictive art as it is for western practitioners . Instead it is an art that is interpretive and philosophical . It is perhaps a way to help us understand ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both our work and social lives . <p> Western Astrology is very different from Chinese astrology .

Fortunately these two very different forces are n't in active competition , in that they are not competing on the same playing field and are n't putting pressure on the other , making it easier to manage your time so that you can have it all . In fact , the belief that you can have it all is the priority from the get go , because unless you believe you can have it all your attempts to juggle and find a balance between work and play , will be half hearted at best . The reality is that you have a dream start to your professional year , with a chance in the early weeks of the year to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your passions before any need to get real . With support right through to the end of April and then plenty of momentum to keep the wheels turning , this is n't just a big professional year for you , but for finally getting a chance to chase your professional dreams . All those things you may have had to put on hold , especially because of home and family demands , can now be chased . If you 've had to make sacrifices in the past , this is finally your turn . Yet 2017 is also a lucky year for matters of the heart and all things fun , playful , romantic and creative , so chasing your professional dream ca n't compromise that . Where you will really benefit this year , is where your professional dreams and passions involve anything creative . It is the fact that this professional wave is very much heart and dream driven , making it a lot easier to find a balance between work and play . However , expect life to get a lot busier when Jupiter returns to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest year for job growth in over a decade . Yet again , it 's not just matters of the heart that will remain important all year , but your relationships . In fact , this is a huge year for personal and professional relationship building . As you move into the third and final year of a three year relationship boot camp , you 've either overcome the challenges of the past or you 're already enjoying the benefits . This of course makes communication essential , making having the communication lines open in a real and authentic way an important New Year 's resolution . There will always be a chance to spread your wings and travel this year . Listen to what your heart is telling you in the early days of the year , make plans in the later part of January and into February , but expect to fly , literally or metaphorically , from early May onwards . <h> Love <p> Chances are you should have a good sense of what you want from love from the get go , moving into the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart , but a potent cocktail of romance and adventure . This will make it clear from the get go that this is one year when staying in a romantic rut is not going to be an option and already , especially in the final weeks of 2016 , you 're likely to find that your excuses have been challenged . Whatever 2016 did or did n't deliver on the romantic front , it has left you with a new sense of resolve and the determination to fight for what you want . For you see , 2017 is your luckiest year for love and romance in over a decade and until lucky Jupiter leaves your romantic sector on the 10th October , he will be out to prove what 's possible . If your confidence was put to the test in the final weeks of 2016 , it was a last minute chance to provide the wakeup calls and confront the challenges that would leave you ready to embrace the future with a fresh sense of enthusiasm .

It is just weeks after Jupiter 's direct turn that Venus will finally move through Gemini , from the 5th July to the 31st July . This is late for Venus , but she will be on hand to make those early months in direct motion count . This will make July one of the most romantically charged months of the year . I say one of , but while Jupiter will leave your romantic sector on the 10th October , there will be support right through to early December to keep the romantic flame burning . October and November will be some of the other most romantically charged months of the year . In the meantime , this is also an important and powerful relationship year , though here there will be a need to take responsibility .

Throughout November and December support will flood in , to bring relationship matters together and put your relationships on the path they will continue on . <h> Money <p> For the majority of the year it is going to be business as usual and that means having the solar spotlight on your financial situation and money matters from the get go . It is an inescapable reality for you that the Sun will always spend the later days and the first three weeks of each year in your financial sector . With December over the most expensive month of any year , while others may go weeks into the New Year before reality hits home , for you it hits home before Christmas .

With Pluto in your financial sector from 2008 to 2016 things will never completely go off the boil , with the planet of change and revolution keeping the wheels turning throughout the year .

Returning in the final days of the year and then not leaving until December 2020 , this is more something that will come into effect next year , but a major period of financial growth will begin . In the meantime , while money matters will continue on a slow burn throughout the year , income matters are on a much shorter fuse . There is n't a moment of 2017 where the focus is n't on money matters to some degree or other , while income opportunities have a window of opportunity that runs from the 4th June to the 26th August . There is a short and sharp period of income opportunities , a smash and grab if you like , but dominating the middle months of the year there are plenty of opportunities within that time .

Born multi-taskers , they can keep many balls in the air at once , holding down two jobs , even dating two people . Ruled by Mercury , Gemini 's great strength is adaptability , the chameleon talent of being able to fit in anywhere . Gemini 's other gift is youthfulness . Always interested in anything new , Gemini is able to keep up with the trends and stay young . When Gemini is functioning full throttle , no one is better at making even complex tasks seem easy . <p> The trouble is that Gemini can get carried away with their own wit and talk more than they work . Less time spend gossiping round the water cooler , and more time actually at the desk , will see you shooting ahead in your career . Things just get ugly when you get caught up in trivia and overlook the important things .

Lucky Jupiter , who will spend the majority of the year in your work sector , making 2017 your biggest year for job growth in over a decade , is playing a long game . Not due to leave until the 10th October and even then , with plenty of support to continue to bring things home right through to December , you 're running a marathon and not a sprint .

While a major year for relationship building will begin with lucky Jupiter 's return to your relationship sector , that is n't until the 10th October , giving you time throughout the year to explore what you want from your relationships and what they need from you . In the meantime , pay attention to a sense of adventure in play during the first six weeks of the year , for while it will taper off a little a sense of wanderlust , curiosity and adventure will run throughout the year . It is in December that this will start to take form , with the door opening to a three year period where travel , learning and discovery wo n't just be something you talk about , with a chance to do something about it .

The more you appreciate the importance of balance , the harder it will be to buy into a rush mentality . <h> Love <p> When lucky Jupiter left your romantic sector in September 2016 he left you with more than enough romantic momentum and also enough support to keep the wheels turning and the romantic flame burning . For the most part this will be a slow burn , but a Full Moon in your romantic sector on the 12th March will rekindle that flame . This year comes with a warning , not that there are any challenges or obstacles to be aware of , for that 's not the case , but a warning that Venus , planet of love is running behind schedule . Held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year Venus , who will normally return to Taurus during or just slightly ahead of or behind your birthday month , will be a no show .

Do n't despair , Venus is on her way and when she finally arrives on the 6th June she will make up for lost time . Arriving long after your birthday month is over , this allows Venus to grab your full attention and until she leaves on the 5th July , this is when you 'll get your first real sense that she really has come with good news .

With so much momentum already created , just a short update would have been enough this year . Instead , what kicks off on the 25th July will continue to gain support right through to the 22nd October . It is Venus and Mars , the planets of love and passion that will make September and October the most romantically charged months of the year . It is near the end of this romantic chapter that Jupiter 's return to your relationship sector on the 10th October will kick off not just the most important relationship months of 2017 , but your biggest and most important relationship year in over a decade .

This is a great opportunity to recognize and personally introduce our partner site Kasamba 's top astrologers " those who help truly improve the lives of their clients and contribute to the astrology community . <p> Get to know our top astrologers ! <p> Our January Astrologer of the Month is Spiritual Insights by Lee " who likes to combine tarot and astrology in her readings . <p> When did you realize you wanted to focus on astrology ? <p> As a child one of my favorite things to do was to read my horoscopes in the local newspaper , but it was only when I was a teenager and my Aunt gave me a book about Astrology , that I discovered that those kind of horoscopes only look at your Sun sign . When I realized that I have a different sign for the Sun , Moon and each planet , I became fascinated with astrology . When I did my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this made me curious to do other people 's charts . It was then that I wanted to focus on Astrology and learn as much as I could. - <p> What 's your background and have you always worked as an astrologer ? <p> I have worked as an Astrologer for many years now , but I also offer psychic readings , Tarot readings , automatic writing readings , Rune Stone readings and Angel card readings . I was taught to cast Rune Stones as a child by my Aunt , who is a psychic and healer herself . My family heritage is Romany , and we have done readings for people for many generations . You could say it runs in my veins ! - <p> While I can do all these types of Astrology readings , my favorite to do is Natal Charts . Everyone , at some stage in their lives , should have their Natal Chart done . It 's such an amazing tool for self-discovery . A Natal Chart , or Birth Chart , uses- the exact time of a person 's birth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that exact time , to tell you about their personality and life . It 's very individual . I would need someone 's date , time and place of birth to do their Natal Chart . It can be very interesting to get your friends , family members or partner 's Natal Chart done to better understand them. - <p> Do you have a regular meditation practice ? And if so , would you mind sharing your technique ? - <p> I meditate daily , first thing in the morning for about 20 minutes . For me , I like to be outdoors when I meditate with my bare feet on the Earth , being grounded by the Earth 's energy . I am fortunate that I live in a climate where I can be outdoors pretty much year round . There are many different ways to meditate but I prefer Transcendental Meditation , which involves using a personal mantra when meditating . I find that meditation helps me in every aspect of my life and I highly recommend it to all my clients. - <p> What do most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients seek insight into all kinds of different topics ; from career and love relationship questions , to family relationships , spiritual development , legal concerns and financial questions . I am happy to read for people on any topic , other than health . I am not a medical professional , so I prefer not to offer health readings. - <p> What has been your most memorable or favorite experience with a client ? - <p> I have had many memorable experiences with clients , but the one that stands out to the most would have to be a client I read for regarding someone from her past . She had never been able to let go of this one man from her past and was n't sure why . I told her that they would end up reconnecting and being together . It was very hard for her to believe this was true at the time , as she was not in contact with him and had no idea where he was . Then one day , he reached out to her on Facebook and they eventually got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me know this . Sometimes it can be hard for clients to believe something I tell them , and I think that is a natural reaction , but its lovely when they take the time to come back and give me an update . I think we all love a happy ending ! - <p> From your observations of people , what would you say is the number one thing that holds most people back from living the life they would like to live ? <p> I think fear and self-doubt are the things that hold people back the most . I always tell my clients , the most important thing is self-love and acceptance . That is where true happiness comes from . Self-love is not about being selfish or ego , it 's about showing yourself love and kindness and allowing yourself to be the truest and most authentic version of yourself . When you love yourself , and believe in yourself , you can achieve so much . We must n't fear what other people think . What others think is none of our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 is here , any important planet transitions worth mentioning for beginning of the year ? <p> We are moving to an emphasis on Mutable signs in 2016 , rather than the previous- Cardinal- signs . So this means that there is a need for adjustment to the changes- occurring- in our lives and throughout the- planet and this obviously requires flexibility . We have Saturn in- Sagittarius , square Neptune in Pisces- and Jupiter in Virgo coming into effect , all signaling a major transition in 2016 . This may all be stressful for some of us , but I believe that a shakeup is what many of us and our governments need . We are switching to a higher level of consciousness and a spiritual awakening as a planet , and this is an ultimately good thing , but it also means that things may need to be broken down before they can be built back better than before . Of course , there is a lot more happening in the year too , and the best way to find out what this all means for you personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Finally , is there anything else you 'd like to say that has n't already been covered ? <p> Astrology is an ancient and extremely accurate form of divination . If you have n't tried it before , or have n't read anything more than just the very basic horoscopes in the newspapers , then I highly recommend you explore it for yourself , and consider getting your Natal and Solar Returns charts done by a professional Astrologer . Understanding yourself better , and having the gift of knowing what is ahead , are invaluable . I , personally , offer a very unique service called an In-depth Email Reading and this is a very detailed reading done using a combination of my own Psychic insights , Tarot cards and Astrology . This gives a very in-depth and accurate reading that my clients find to be extremely helpful and insightful . I welcome to you to try it for yourself ! -

Many homes have ugly spots ' which are never fixed up , just left to get more and more cluttered with time .

@@73187080 @1887080/ <h> Tarot Love Cards and Water Signs <p> There are many connections between the four earth based elements of astrology ( wind , water , earth and fire ) , and the tarot . Typically , these relationships involve various cards within the major arcana , and specific signs of the zodiac . In both the tarot and astrology , the progression from one card or sign to the next suggests a great deal about the choices we make , as well as what we can expect at various stages of life . <p> Coincidentally , in both astrology and the tarot , emotions are often symbolized by water . Without a question , the zodiac signs associated with water are as powerful and unstoppable as the forces which drive us to find mates . Each water sign represents the romantic journey an individual will take from birth to death . In a similar way , the five cards in the major arcana that are most associated with fertility issues describe the journey of a couple . Therefore , tarot cards related to the stages of a romantic partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement to each other . <p> While it may sound somewhat cynical , there is only one end to physical life , no matter who we are born to , or what we do during our lives . That said , between birth and death we have many opportunities for happiness and comfort . The ability of a society to survive and move forward is also heavily dependant on the ability of individuals to successfully raise children to maturity . Therefore , it should be no wonder that almost all systems of divination devote a great deal of time and attention to the life cycle of a romance . <p> Of all the signs of the zodiac , Scorpio is the most closely associated with passion , allure , and mystery . In many ways , Scorpio represents the young person in all of us . This sign speaks of the young man or woman searching for a mate as well as the creation of a firm basis in the world . These are the times of forceful emotions , fierce action , and uncontrollable desires . <p> As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to develop some control of ourselves , and become more suitable candidates for raising a family . Perhaps it can be said that the successful completion of our " Scorpio years " will result in a Magician and an Empress . The Magician is able to secure all the material necessities for survival , while the Empress is filled with all the bounty and fertility with which to bring forth and raise children . <p> In any community , there are dozens of people reaching this stage of life at a similar time . As a result , it is not always easy to know which person will make the best mate . For this reason , the card of the Lovers is also called the card of choices . At the same time , individuals moving into the sign of Cancer learn to see what is inside . Recognizing a soul-mate can be as sudden as a moment in the sunshine , or a meeting of eyes over a cup of coffee . This second water sign provides the perfect environment for the newly emerged Magician and Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy we are with our families , careers , and overall lifestyle , there comes a point when we realize that the best years of our life are gone . Mid-life crisis is n't just a time when we begin to contemplate our children leaving home , it is a time when we begin to wonder what will happen to us after we die . At the same time , we may still be engaged in nurturing activities . <p> Depending on what our life goals are , and how much we have actually achieved , many negative emotions and sentiments can come to the surface . Feelings of being chained to dependants , and even resentment of the families we have created are well symbolized by the Devil . This feeling of being trapped can last for years . Even as a couple strives to continue on with their initial plans , they may feel like they are dead inside . Whatever spark or sense brought them together may or may not survive this stage . <p> Many people in mid-life crisis look at the children they have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child picks an unsuitable mate , ca n't hold a job , or has other issues , the parents suffer with their own emotions . As a result , self-pity , and a feeling of hopelessness , as represented by the Moon , also symbolize the waning energies of the Cancer stage of our lives . <p> Interestingly enough , Pisces , the final water sign , is also the last sign of the zodiac . As we stretch into old age , and towards the final cards of the tarot , we begin to surrender our soul to the universe . The cards of love and romance , and all our choices related to how to manage our fertility are gone and passed . We no longer look back mournfully on our youth , or to the side at the mate we may or may not still have with us . Rather , we look to the end of this life , and prepare for the beginning of the next one . <p> For societies that believe in reincarnation , the transition from Scorpio to Cancer to Pisces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The choices we make in terms of who we will create , and raise children with is in harmony with the very essence of life , death , and the carrying forward with life again . As a result , we are no longer separate humans , but tied in to the very essence of what it is to be a living being . <p> Tarot and astrology are just two reminders that we are not really strangers to ourselves , those who live alongside us , or to the millions of people that have gone before us . Rather , we are all seeking to find answers to the same problems our ancestors had . Perhaps one day we will all come full circle at the same time , and realize that the journey itself was the answer we sought all along . 
@@73187081 @1887081/ <h> Learn to Read Tarot Cards <p> Meanings The trickiest aspect of reading Tarot Cards is remembering their meanings . Memorization can be easy if one uses simple steps . All the cards in the Major Arcana are numbered from zero to twenty-one , starting with the Fool and ending in the World , or Universe . The Major Arcana are , perhaps , the easiest cards to read because their titles bespeak their meanings . For example , the fool is usually regarded as one who does n't think before they speak or are too confident for their own good . This is the fool 's meaning . <p> However , when first learning the Tarot , always get a good book to help guide you to these meanings . The Lovers , for instance , may mean a choice one has to make instead of an affair or new romance . When first memorizing , only memorize the positive , or upright meaning of these cards . The reversed meanings can be learned at a later time . <p> Minor Arcana In the Minor Arcana , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swords represent problems , hearts symbolize love , pentacles speak of money , and wands represent your social life and your work environment . For example , if a Two of Hearts appears in your spread , the number two symbolizes that this card is under the High Priestess , which is numbered two in the Major Arcana . This card represents knowledge , wisdom , and a nurturing nature . The hearts , of course , means love . <p> So if you put these two aspects together , the Two of Hearts means that you have a loving and nurturing relationship in which both people reciprocate their feelings equally . Another example is if a Seven of Pentacles turns up in your spread . The number seven specifies that the card is under the Chariot and the pentacles symbolize money . Thus , the Seven of Pentacles means that one is going in the direction they need to take in order to make more money for oneself . <p> Major Arcana The Court Cards in the Minor Arcana can be confusing at times because most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on where the card is in a particular spread and what cards surround it . Some readers narrow the meanings down to just representing people . This practice is fine , but one has a chance of misreading them as well . One example is the Knight of Swords . This Knight can represent a young person , usually in their early twenties who is rash and burdens others with his/her problems . The situation meaning is similar in that news wo n't be received about a particular event and the person will become frustrated with delayed plans . <p> The cards that only symbolizes people are the Kings . The King of Wands , symbolizes a man in his thirties or older , who is popular with his peers and is not sentimental . This man will help a person , but may not stay to finish a project . Some Tarot Readers link astrology with the court cards to help better find the person who the court cards signify . <p> Spreads The other important aspect of reading the cards is , of course , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spread . The Celtic Cross is the most popular and is easy to interpret . Other spreads include the 21 Card , the Tree , and the Astrological Spread . Keep in mind that there is no right way to lay out a spread . Everyone has their own rules and habits of laying out the cards . Some readers spread the Cards face down on a surface for the other person to choose at random while other readers deal the cards from the top of the deck . The decision is up to the reader . <p> As one comes to be more practiced in the art of the Tarot , the memorization of the reversed cards can take place . Many of these cards mean the opposite of what they are when they fall upright . However , do n't take that for granted . Memorize each and every one because the meanings can be very challenging . <p> With these very basic rules , one can begin to study and read Tarot Cards almost immediately . Always let your intuition and heart lead you in these readings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always give encouragement . Remember , the Nine of Cups is the wish card , so make sure the one getting the reading makes a wish ! Above else , have fun and a light-hearted attitude towards this ancient , beautiful practice . 
@@73187082 @1887082/ <h> Tarot Cards for Beginners <p> If you want to get into Tarot but have no idea where to start , you 've come to the right place . <p> The most important thing to do in order to start learning is to pick up a book and a deck . While there are hundreds of decks to choose from , every beginner should start with the Rider-Waite tarot deck , as this is the most widely used deck . Once you have familiarized yourself with this deck , you can branch out to others . To start out with you should n't confuse yourself by learning more than one deck . <p> The Rider-Waite deck was developed by A.E . Waite , a member of the Golden Dawn and a central figure in the development of the Western Esoteric Tradition . Waite distills a number of complex philosophies and archetypes in the Rider-Waite deck that have their roots in Jewish and Christian mysticism . These build on the more " traditional " Tarot images and interpretations used in medieval decks , and are responsible for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with his deck , but it really is n't for beginners . The descriptions that he gives are well-suited to early 20th century spiritualist types , but are a bit thick for the modern student . The best books written on the Rider-Waite Tarot on the market are by Rachel Pollack . There is a two book set called " 78 Degrees of Wisdom " written by her ; Book 1 covers the major arcana and Book 2 covers the minor arcana . This is an excellent starting point as Pollack not only explains the thick metaphors in Waite 's cards , she draws out the psychological interpretations as well . <p> The major arcana are what are more commonly known as the " trump " cards . These are the signature cards of the Tarot , and they tell a story of the Fool 's journey of enlightenment . Each card on its own is a fascinating collection of symbols and ideas that lends itself to being much more than a divinatory tool . Death , for example , is not just death itself , but major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards have layers of meaning like this that are very fascinating to learn . <p> The minor arcana are the cards numbered 1-10 in any one of the four suits , which in Waite 's deck are Pentacles , Swords , Wands , and Cups . These cards were often not given images in medieval decks - Waite 's deck marks one of the first that goes to the trouble of giving the minor arcana appropriate imagery . <p> The court cards are the page , knight , queen and king of each suit , and are often used as " significators " , or cards that are representative of the querent . There are a number of ways of choosing an appropriate significator , from laying them all out and asking the querent to pick the one that most appeals to them , to asking the astrological sign of the querent and assigning the court card to them that matches to the element of their sign , their gender , and age . <p> The basic " spread " that everyone learns to start , and most readers stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This spread has two cards " crossing " each other at the centre , four cards at the cardinal points surrounding them , and four cards at the side of the " cross " . <p> The significator is sometimes placed under the first card drawn to represent the querent . Position one reflects the problem itself , and the good and bad influences present . Position two reflects the opposing forces to the situation . Position three , at the " base " of the cross , represents the historical factors influencing the situation . Position four , to the left of the " small cross " , represents factors that have been impacting the situation but are now passing away . <p> The fifth position , at the top of the cross , represents a possible future if certain actions are allowed to go on and actions are taken . The sixth position , to the right of the small cross , represents what will happen in the situation no matter what . <p> The seventh position , at the base of the four-card " tower " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their attitude towards the situation . The eighth position , immediately above that , represents the attitude of other people involved , usually friends and family . The ninth position refers to " hopes and fears " , which represents the querent 's secret hopes and fears about the situation , which usually influence the outcome somewhat . The tenth card is the final , all-encompassing outcome . <p> There are several schools of thought on how the inverted meanings of a tarot card should be read - inverted is when the tarot card is upside down . Most experts agree that an inverted meaning is not the opposite to the original meaning of the card , but a subtle shift to the original meaning of the card that affects the outcome . For example , Death inverted may mean an inevitable change that the querent is struggling against . The reader that taught me how to read Tarot had an interested viewpoint - who is the card inverted to ? Since the client is the most important person in the reading , does that not mean that cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Based on this logic she discounted inverted meanings entirely , and I am still inclined to agree . Inverted meanings are an overcomplication of what is already a very complex system of symbols and meanings . <p> This should be enough to get you started on the path of Tarot . Do n't forget to meditate daily on one card , and eventually you 'll have them all committed to memory . It took me a few years of doing this to really have the Tarot burned into my mind , and I still have n't forgotten the meanings of the cards 16 years later . You will also find that studying Tarot will also open up your powers of interpretation and focus in other areas of your life as well ; in other words , there is no downside . Enjoy !

Make time on a day that you know wo n't be busy , every week , to clear out clutter .

The practice dates back as early as 4000 BCE , where dwellings were found in Banpo that were aligned for proper solar gain , or passive solar heating . While useful for practical items like this , Feng Shui is about aligning the Qi , or " chi " as it is more commonly known in Western culture . <p> Feng Shui tells us that we must have a purpose for each room in the home , and the room must be designed to meet that purpose .

High quality sheets from organic materials will also help the Qi alignment of the room . <p> For lighting , use candles or a dimmer switch if that is not practical . There should be several levels of lighting , from overhead to small lamps to candles so that you can easily control the lighting from the bed . <p> Art should be pleasing and upbeat - the art that you have in your bedroom is representative of scenes you want to manifest in your life .

Keep mirrors pointing away from the bed - you should never have mirrors over or facing the bed . <p> As more of an intangible quality , you should feel nurtured when you fall asleep and refreshed when you wake up in the morning , and be made happy by what you see in your bedroom .

While this may have been a trial by fire at first , this year this matures into something a lot more sustainable .

It 's very rare to still have planetary activity in your relationship sector in January , let alone any further into the year and with lucky Jupiter in your romantic sector until the 9th September this is a year that should leave the field clear for the most romantically charged months in decades .

There has been no extended planetary activity in your career sector since the 8 months Mars spent in your career sector from December 2013 to July 2014 and no extended planetary activity in your work sector since Neptune 's departure in 2012 . This has given you a stable period where work and career matters stayed in their own lanes , with January/February usually the most active months of any year for career matters and September/October for work matters . This year there is a blurring of the lines due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars in your work sector since November and Ceres in your career sector since late October . Yet while this means that there has been little chance of keeping your professional hats off over the holiday period , it means that you 'll have a running start to your 2016 year , despite the fact that they 'll both leave in January . Mars will leave your work sector on the 4th January , so while you 'll begin the year with your work passions , fighting and competitive spirit fuelled and plenty of momentum , you 're on your own after that . This is the head start you want , for on the 9th September lucky Jupiter will return to your work sector to kick off your biggest and most opportune year for work opportunities and growth in over a decade , one that will run through to October 2017 .

While Saturn is a demanding and at times challenging planet , this does n't mean you have a year of financial challenges in front of you , but it does mean that you can no longer sweep things under the carpet or stick your head in the sand . You 'll be forced to confront financial issues and matters , take responsibility and become accountable , but these just happen to be the core ingredients to taking your power back .

Mars ' first visit will run from the 6th March to the 28th May , returning from the 3rd August to the 27th September to wrap things up .

Venus returned to your romantic sector on the 30th December 2015 and while this meant she spent less than 48 hours of 2015 there , 2016 is the winner for while she 'll leave on the 24th January , she 'll be back from the 18th October to the 12th November . With Saturn spending the whole year in your romantic sector and Mars , who normally moves through in just 6 weeks every other year here for nearly 20 weeks in total , the love gods are going all out to make this a powerful year for love and romance . Mars is spending so much time here because while he 'll move through from the 6th March to the 28th May , his retrograde turn on the 18th April means that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 27th September for a double dip visit . With Venus returning just weeks later , between them they 're keeping the romantic flame burning , with Saturn making matters of the heart serious business . Venus will retrograde every other year , which is why one year will see her miss out whole areas of your chart completely and the other she 'll visit twice to make up and that 's the case for your relationships as well . Last year Venus flew through your relationship sector in just 24 days , from the 4th to the 28th January 2015 but this year , while she wo n't return until the 17th February and will leave on the 12th March , by then your annual relationship review and any relationship housekeeping will be over , returning again on the 8th December where she 'll see out the year . Before you even move into the year you 'll have a fairly good sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you , with the right amount of support to support your relationships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Business <p> Overlaying anything that is or is n't happening on the work and career fronts this year or what the professional gods are up to , is the fact that 2016 is one of the best and most potentially lucrative year for income opportunities and matters . Any planet that moves through your work sector or career sectors this year will move into a positive aspect with lucky Jupiter , who is not only in your income sector until the 9th September , but has support that will keep the tap flowing right through to May 2017 . Those periods will not only provide income opportunities with an outlet , but the planets concerned will move into an auspicious aspect to Jupiter , who needing them to get the income results he 's here to create , will give them an extra boost . It 's work matters that will benefit the most , simply because with Pluto in your work sector from 2008 to 2024 he 's been on especially good terms with Jupiter since he returned to your income sector in August 2015 and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because Pluto is a constant force on the work front and is here for all 366 days of 2016 , it 's work matters that have a major edge this year . That will be especially so in the early and later weeks of the year , due to the fact that you will always start and end each year with the Sun in your work sector and where the Sun goes Venus and Mercury will follow . This year work matters will remain active much longer into the year and will start off much earlier later in the year . Last year Venus , who only spent the first few days of 2015 in your work sector , wo n't return until the 24th January and here until the 17th February she 'll keep things moving long after the Sun leaves on the 21st January . At the same time , while a New Moon on the 10th January will create an opportunity for new beginnings and opportunities with Mercury , who leaves your work sector on the 2nd January , retrograding back in for a double dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to new beginnings and opportunities , they 'll also open to second chances and will remain open until the 26th January . Having returned on the 10th December 2015 for what should have been a 15 day visit , by the time Mercury leaves on the 14th February you 'll have had plenty of time to keep your head in the game . Meanwhile Mars , who did n't visit your work sector in 2015 , will return on the 27th September , kicking things off much earlier than the normal December start , keeping them in motion right through to the early weeks of 2017 . Career matters receive less support from the professional gods , but with a narrower window of time to work with , this will create a short , sharp period where there 'll be a push to get career matters up to speed . This will begin with Mercury 's return on the 6th April and will end with his departure on the 13th June . During that time the Sun will move through from the 20th April to the 21st May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Moon on the 7th May will create an opportunity for new beginnings and opportunities . But in the same way that Mercury turned retrograde in your work sector , he 'll do the same here in your career sector , but it 's while in retrograde motion , from the 29th April to the 23rd May that something extraordinary will happen . On the 10th May , just 3 days after the New Moon and while Mercury is in retrograde motion , he 'll literally cross the Sun 's path in what is a rare Mercury transit or Mercury eclipse , where Mercury can be physically seen crossing the path of the Sun , a rare cosmic event that is bound to make news headlines . This brings the element of fate into play in a major way . It could be that you emerge from this period with a completely different definition of professional success . <h> Money <p> As far as years go and especially when it comes to both income and financial matters , it does n't come much bigger than this , creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all 366 days of this leap year . That was always going to be the case to a degree , with Neptune in your financial sector from 2012 to 2024 , but with so much happening on the income front as well this makes this the most extreme year in that period , the year when income forces are muscling their way in . It began with lucky Jupiter 's return to your income sector in August 2015 and while a parade of planets moved through to support his early months , including Venus and Mars , the game changer was the North Node 's return to your income sector and the South Node 's return to your financial sector in November . This came just days after a series of oppositions between income and financial forces brought 3 months of financial tensions to an end , with the lunar nodes stepping in to police a balance between the two . However , lunar nodes also mean eclipses and when you have eclipses you have the opportunity for some major breakthroughs . This will be experienced through a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a solar eclipse in your income sector on the 1st September . The North Node and Jupiter are the two luckiest and most auspicious forces in the solar system and meeting up in your income sector for the first time in 35 years , this makes this one of the best years for income growth , potential and opportunity in decades . However , financial forces will be keeping you grounded and it 's that balance between money coming in and money going out that will ultimately work to your advantage , though at times there will be financial tension , most likely during the most active points of the year for income and financial matters . For financial and money matters that will be from 19th February to the 22nd March and especially around the time of the solar eclipse on the 20th March . The most active income months , bearing in mind that on both the financial and income fronts this is simply the peak of activity here all year , will run from the 31st July to the 23rd September , peaking with the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lunar eclipse in March have the potential to bring both income and financial matters to a head , turning and/or tipping point . 4689 @qwx624689 4690 @qwx624690 <h> About Leo <p> Leo is good at being warm hearted , generous and kind .

@@73187124 @1887124/ <h> 2016 Overview <p> In many ways 2016 is a continuation of 2015 , with all the main influences that will shape the year as a whole already in play , even though in some cases the real importance wo n't be fully appreciated until you look back in hindsight . That is especially so when it comes to matters of the heart , with the North Node in a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart from February 2014 to November 2015 , giving your heart a sense of direction and drawing it naturally to a future that even as you move into the New Year is set to materialise . However , moving into the New Year with Mars here and your romantic and creative passions and fighting spirit fuelled it could feel that this is it , except even this is just a stepping stone . It 's Venus ' return on the 30th August and lucky Jupiter 's return just 10 days later that kicks off your luckiest year for love and biggest year for all things romantic , creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been in training for since February 2014 . Until then Jupiter , which along with Saturn will create the tone of any given year , is more focused on things close to home , working until leaving your home and family sector on the 9th September to create strong roots and the platform from which the coming years will build on from . This makes this an important year for home , family and/or property matters in general and one where luck is on your side . This is also a chance to focus on making your life as love and user friendly as possible . In the meantime , while Saturn left your work sector last September , with Venus having just left on the 30th December and Mars returning on the 4th January , the legacy of all the hard work on the work front will continue through much of 2016 , more so than you would normally expect .

That should be what happens but it is n't , with a planet that should n't have the influence he has on the year itself having a big influence and it 's all to do with the fact that he 'll not only turn retrograde but where he turns retrograde . Mars will spend from the 4th January to the 27th September moving backwards and forwards between your work and relationship sectors , visiting both twice and spending time in retrograde motion in both . This makes this a year where the work opportunities can continue to be exploited , while your relationships get some major support . <h> Love <p> It is very rare to have a year where there is continuous support from either the love or relationship gods , but when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year itself . While Jupiter 's return to your romantic sector on the 9th September will begin your luckiest year for love in over a decade , spanning the final 4 months of 2016 and the first 9 months of 2017 , this will be a significant point in the year for all things romantic and the biggest boost that matters of the heart have had for over a decade , but by then the year itself will be established and it will be part of the years itself . Relationship matters are a completely different story with Saturn who moved into , out of and back into your relationship sector last year as he settled in , is now here to stay and not due to leave until December 2017 he 'll spend every moment of 2016 here , influencing the year itself . Making his first visit in 3 decades this makes 2016 a year where relationship building is a major theme and focus this year , with everything else in your life having to fit around that . While Saturn has enrolled you in relationship boot camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test , this does n't automatically mean there will be relationship challenges . Saturn is here to help build strong and authentic relationships and you ca n't do that if you sweep issues under the carpet . However , Saturn and your relationships have a lot of support , with Venus here as you move into the New Year and while she 'll leave on the 24th January , the planet of love will be back again from the 18th October to the 12th November . Even Mars , who will normally spend just 6 weeks in your relationship sector every other year , will spend nearly 4 times that long , moving through from the 6th March to the 28th May and then retrograding back in for a double dip visit from the 3rd August to the 27th September . There will be plenty of support for Saturn and your relationships in this , your most important relationship year in decades , so important that it is influencing the shape of the year itself .

What is behind you is a tough 3 year boot camp and with that over , the momentum , determination and knowledge gained can now to be used to your advantage . It 's Neptune , in your career sector from 2012 to 2026 that will provide the professional background for the year to come , helping to redefine your professional dreams , but also guaranteeing that there 'll be a near constant need to keep your professional hat on 24/7 . However , if the work/life balance tensions in the second half of 2015 have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . As long as you continue to abide by those wakeup calls there 's no reason why you ca n't get the best out of what is a good year for both work and career matters , but also an important year for home and family matters . It 's Mars that brings home the advantages of recent years , with Venus ' departure from your work sector on the 30th December 2015 bringing a chance to take your work hat off over the New Year , while Mars ' return on the 4th January will have it straight back on again . Venus ' departure should and did bring all the planetary activity in your work sector for 2015 to an end and she 'll return on the 24th September , where with the help of the Sun and Mercury she 'll bring your next annual update on the work front , which will run its course on the 22nd November . However , a lot of water will pass under the bridge between now and then , thanks to Mars ' extended visit . Normally moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission to fuel your work passions , fighting and competitive spirit and create some of the busiest but also potentially successful weeks for work matters in a 2 year period , the warrior planet of the cosmos will spend considerably more time here . Mars will return on the 4th January and leave on the 6th March , nearly 9 weeks after arriving , but will return for a double dip visit from the 28th May until the 3rd August . In retrograde motion from the 28th May to the 30th June , this is when you 'll have a chance to go after untapped potential . In all Mars will spend just under 19 weeks in your work sector this year , leaving just 6 weeks before Venus returns to usher in the next annual update . Meanwhile , while career matters will remain on a slow boil all year , the most active weeks will run from the 19th February to the 6th April and it 's during this period that on the 9th March you 'll have your first total solar eclipse in your career sector in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' departure from your work sector and right in the heart of some of the best conditions of the year for career matters , creating the potential for major new beginnings .

With Pluto in your financial sector from 2008 to 2026 , his only visit in your lifetime will keep the focus on money matters going 365 days a year , but for the most part he 'll work in the background , working on promoting financial growth and evolution , especially when it comes to your attitudes to and relationship with money .

This year Pluto is doing nothing different than he does every other year , but while over recent years he 's found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time , this year his and your fortunes finally change . Pluto is on especially good terms with the other planets in the solar system and with no real challenges , other than competition from income forces midyear , this will see a rise in financial confidence and a drop in financial pressure . This frees you up to focus on money matters when things become more active and on income matters when they get their turn . The Sun will always begin and end the year in your financial sector , so this is when the focus will always be on financial and money matters , but with the Sun gone and your financial review over by the 21st January , Venus and Mercury are set to have some fun with this after your annual financial review is over . Venus wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 17th February she 'll fuel your financial confidence , desires and expectations and trigger the laws of attraction . Meanwhile Mercury , who leaves your financial sector on the 2nd January , will return for a double dip visit from the 9th January to the 14th February and in retrograde motion until the 26th January his smart head for money will come with 20/20 hindsight . Mercury 's departure on the 14th February and Venus ' on the 17th February will bring your annual financial review to an end , with the next one starting with Venus ' return on the 12th November , when you 'll do it all over again . In contrast income matters get very little attention this year , with the money gods forced to do a smash and grab " getting in , seizing income opportunities and getting out . This will begin with Venus ' return on the 18th June and will end just 5 weeks later , with the Sun 's departure on the 22nd July . 4689 @qwx624689 4692 @qwx624692 <h> About Gemini <p> Gemini is good at communicating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air at once , holding down two jobs , even dating two people .

Saturn and Jupiter are the driving force of the year itself , but their partnership with other planets in the solar system is putting a unique stamp on the year itself that brings a new sense of professional confidence and an unhurried feel . After a short exploratory trip between December 2014 and June 2015 Saturn , your ruling planet , returned to your sector of subconscious thinking , imagination and review in September 2015 , beginning the wind down of a Saturn cycle that began in 1988 and wo n't end until the hard taskmaster of the cosmos returns to Capricorn in December 2017 . Spending the whole of 2016 here this brings you to the end of a major life chapter , creating a year where you 'll need to spend more time reflecting , looking back and making sense of either the last 3 decades or if you were born after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there is a lot of support , especially from Uranus in your home and family sector . This is going to make your home life and space more important this year , becoming your sanctuary and the place where you 're able to retreat to in order to reflect and find time to hear yourself think . However , do n't think that means you 'll navel gaze your way through 2016 , for this is a year that is full of opportunities for adventure , travel , learning and discovery , with lucky Jupiter in your sector of adventure , travel , learning and discovery until the 9th September , but a sense of wanderlust , curiosity and adventure living on long after he 's gone . As well as an opportunity to expand your world and your experiences , this is having a huge impact on your personal confidence , to a point where this is the year where you come into your own , giving yourself permission to live life to the full . While the year itself does n't reveal itself to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , there will be clues in the very early days of the year . You 'll move into the year with Mars in your career sector and while he 'll leave on the 4th January , starting with your professional passions , fighting and competitive spirit engaged holds clues to this year 's biggest secret . On the 9th September Jupiter will return to your career sector , beginning your biggest , most expansive and potentially successful professional year in over a decade , making it important to pay attention to those very early days of the month and the professional passions , fighting and competitive spirit Mars is fuelling , for already the professional gods will be lining up for what lies ahead . The year has a social flavour to it as well , especially in the first three months and again in the middle months of the year , interspersed with times when you will need to put out the ' do not disturb ' sign . <h> Love <p> On both the romantic and relationship fronts there is no major ongoing planetary activity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in the past . What this means is that the love and relationship gods have no barrel to push or major agenda to focus on , but at the same time this offers specific points of the year where you 're able to give your relationship and matters of the heart your undivided attention . If this was a year where there was all round focus on your relationships , this would continue even through the most romantically charged months of the year and vice versa . However what you do have full time support with , is on the communication front and it 's during the most active weeks of the year for your relationships that this will come into its own . Romantic forces get their first voice when Venus moves through your sign from the 24th January to the 17th February and having only spent a few days here last year , she 's out to make up for lost time . It 's when your romantic sector becomes active that things will start moving and it 's here that I believe we have the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity here with Mercury , who normally moves through in just 15 days , instead turning retrograde , arriving on the 6th April but not leaving until the 13th June . It 's during his retrograde phase , from the 29th April to the 29th May that we 'll experience a Mercury transit or Mercury eclipse , where Mercury can be seen travelling across the face of the Sun , with this happening on the 10th May and bringing the element of fate into play . Venus , planet of love will move through your romantic sector from the 30th April to the 24th May so will be here at the time , as will the Sun who moves through from the 20th April to the 21st May . Even if that was all this would be a stunning few months for romantic matters , but Ceres ' return from the 17th July to the 13th October will keep the romantic flame burning . This will cross into the relationship focused months of the year , but as a dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system Ceres will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any demands . The most important relationship months of the year begin with Venus , planet of love 's return on the 18th June and will have run their course by the time the Sun leaves on the 22nd July . This is a period of just under 5 weeks , so nothing like the months of support romantic forces are getting , but then your relationships have the support of Pluto in your communication sector , making these some of the best and most important relationship weeks of the year . <h> Business <p> Apart from the fact that you 'll move into the year with Mars in your career sector and Ceres in your income sector , both events that are over and above the normal scope of any year , things are deceptively quiet on the professional front , with nothing to suggest that 2016 is set to become a monster professional year , transforming into your biggest professional year in over a decade . While the most active months of any year for career matters will surround the Sun 's annual visit , each September/October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they both returned last November and Venus left in early December , Mars is still here as you move into the New Year , albeit just . Due to leave on the 4th January Mars may have minimal impact on the year itself , spending less than 72 hours of 2016 here , beginning the year here this will ensure your professional passions , fighting and competitive spirit are engaged from the get go . This does n't mean you 're being short changed , for this is simply 2015 's professional influences spilling into the early days of 2016 , something you 're able to take advantage of . Mars will still be here when things kick off on the income front on the 2nd January and while they might be slow to start , with February due to be the most lucrative month of 2016 , this is when last year 's professional push will bear fruit . Mars ' departure will leave you with no planetary activity in either of your professional houses and that will remain the case until the Sun returns to your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of opportunity that will have run its course by the 30th June . With no ongoing opportunity on the work front it 's during this short window of time that the professional gods will direct all their attention onto making any shifts , progress or developments on the work front . The professional gods are n't glossing over work matters , but they have their eye on a much bigger prize . Had this been an ordinary year , which despite its best efforts to disguise it during the first 8 months of 2016 it is anything but , then this would then have given you a chance to let work matters play out before the professional gods gave career matters the same degree of attention . Venus ' return to your career sector on the 30th August will get the ball rolling before the Sun 's return on the 23rd September , yet before then everything will change . The game changer is lucky Jupiter 's return to your career sector on the 9th September , kicking off your biggest , luckiest and most expansive professional year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 to play out . From Venus ' return on the 30th August and Mercury 's departure on the 25th October you 'll have just under 2 months to prepare for , welcome and settle Jupiter into your career sector , after which the professional gods will take over , keeping things in motion for the rest of the year , with opportunities continuing to expand and open up right through to the second half of 2017 . <h> Money <p> In any given year the money gods operate for differing amounts of time and under differing conditions through your two money houses and located on opposite sides of the sky and therefore mainly active at opposite points of the year , in a year that is balanced this will see income matters most active in January/February and financial matters most active in July/August . However in recent years , while that rule still applied on a mundane level , major forces in play screwed things to a point where you had a year that was more dominated by money matters and other years that were more dominated by income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a more balanced state of affairs and that bodes well for a balanced year for both money and income matters . Until Neptune left your income sector in 2012 there had been continuous planetary activity in your income sector since 1995 , so when Jupiter returned to your income sector in July 2014 , there was a huge push to make overall financial and money matters a priority , in order to balance things out . With that achieved what you have as you move into 2016 is a level playing field , with both income and money matters having an advantage that is above the norm , but is again balanced . You 'll begin the year with a lot more financial confidence thanks to the 15 months planetary activity in your financial sector from July 2014 to October 2015 , which included lucky Jupiter 's 15 month visit and Venus ' 4 month visit . You 'll begin the year with an income advantage due to the fact that Ceres , dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system spent so much time in your income sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 29th January . On a mission to get beyond the money to your real income value , needs and priorities , by the time Mercury returns on the 2nd January you 'll be ready to put that to practice . This kicks off the most potentially lucrative income months of 2016 , which run from the 2nd January to the 5th March , only to be picked up again later in the year , when Venus makes a rare double visit , from the 8th December 2016 to the 3rd January 2017 and Mars makes his first visit in nearly 2 years , from the 9th November to the 19th December . Unlike the four months that the money gods will focus on income matters , during the first and the last two months of the year it 's during a short period , from the 14th July to the 31st August that you 'll have a chance to take care of any financial housekeeping .

It was Jupiter 's return to your sign on the 11th August 2015 that began a new 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion and growth , spending 13 months laying down the foundations , planting seeds and opening major new doors , everything that the coming decade will grow on from . For some the shifts will be abrupt , able to see this immediately as the point that a new chapter started , with a real line in the sand , but for others those major new beginnings may come disguised as ordinary events or ordinary evolution , only to look back over the coming months and years to identify this as the time that change began .

Family matters are always going to bring demands , as anyone who has brought up children , dealt with family members or just has to deal with the complexities of family life knows , but when you throw in the hard taskmaster of the cosmos then there are no excuses to hide behind . Saturn will demand that you deal with things rather than sweep things under the carpet , but also that you take responsibility and deal with demands with a stoic sense of resignation . Yet in doing so you 've got the means to create some real bonds and something strong and enduring and in the process create some firm foundations for the next chapter in your life , something that will support this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September that 2016 's best kept secret will be revealed , with Jupiter 's return to your income sector kicking off a lucky year for income growth , opportunities and a boost in confidence across all the currencies in your life . Meanwhile , with a lot of focus on personal growth and family dynamics this is putting some pressure on your relationships , with the extraordinary amount of time that Mars will spend in your communication sector this year providing support on both fronts . Normally moving through your communication sector in just 6 weeks , Mars will return on the 4th January and will leave on the 6th March , but will return for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August . Mars ' first visit coincides with the most important weeks of 2016 for relationship matters and the second with the most important weeks of 2016 for personal and professional networking , friendship and relationship building . <h> Love <p> With Pluto in your romantic sector until 2024 and Neptune in your romantic sector until 2026 and both here for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an important year for love and your relationships , will always be yes . The fact that you have love and relationship gods on permanent duty for years to come means that there will be no point in the year where there is n't at least some focus , but what kind of focus and what kind of conditions depends on two things . The first factor is what are conditions around Neptune and Pluto and what support is there at the time , which means that there will be times of the year that is going to be more focused on your relationships and others when there is more focus on matters of the heart . One wo n't go away while the focus shifts to the other , but the volume will be louder at different points of the year . The first factor for both is the major influences both are under and for matters of the heart it 's extremely good news . With both Jupiter and the North Node , the two most auspicious forces in the solar system supporting Pluto and matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus , who only spent a few days in your romantic sector in 2015 will visit twice this year , first from the 24th January to the 17th February and again from the 12th November to the 8th December . With December and January always the most romantically charged months of any year , she 'll be extending this out for a month either side , with a Full Moon on the 20th July providing the perfect midyear romantic boost . Your relationships on the other hand have more complex conditions , in that the same support that Jupiter and the North Node are giving for money matters , is creating relationship pressure , putting them in opposition with relationship forces . You experienced the full force of this between August and November 2015 , but with the South Node spending its first and only full year in your relationship sector and the North Node its first and only full year in your sign in 17 years , they 're part of a process of ensuring you maintain the right balance between your personal and relationship needs . This might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be because things have become out of balance . There is a huge amount of support from communication forces this year , especially during the most active months for relationship building , which is in February and March . Mars will even return for a double dip visit to your communication sector from late May to early August , committed to giving your relationships a voice and keeping the communication lines open . <h> Business <p> By cosmic stands 2016 is n't a game changing professional year , but on the other hand it 's not a mediocre year either , with just enough extra attention to raise the bar on both the work and career fronts , but not enough that it becomes demanding . The one advantage that you do have , is that for the second year in a row you 'll move into the New Year with Mars in your income sector and while he 'll leave on the 4th January , starting the year with a sledgehammer in your hand and your warrior spirit intent on smashing glass ceilings will be an advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9th September to kick off your luckiest and most potentially lucrative income year in over a decade . The other advantage is that you 'll not only move into the New Year with Ceres , dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system in your work sector , but having spent over 7 months here over the course of 2015 she allows you to start the year with a clear sense of what you want and need in terms of job satisfaction and a sense of purpose . Ceres is not powerful enough to trigger developments and even if she could that 's not what she 's about , which is more about establishing what you want so that when the big guns arrive , they 'll have a game plan to work with . Having moved through from April to August 2015 and then returning at the end of October to start over again from scratch , Ceres is still here as you move into the New Year and while she 'll leave on the 29th January , by then the professional gods will have not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns on the 21st January , shining the solar spotlight on your work situation , matters and options , Ceres will be in her final days and your annual update will be a lot more effective than it usually is .

It 's later in the year that the professional gods will pull out the bigger guns , with Mars returning on the 9th November and Venus on the 8th December , kicking off an active phase that will extend out to the early months of 2017 .

By then they 'll be moving in a much tighter pack than they are at the start and end of the year , when they move through your work sector and rather than spread out like work matters are , you have a very short sharp period of career opportunities and with a small window to work with , if there are to be any shifts on the career front then they 're likely to be during the 6 week period from the Sun 's return to your career sector on the 21st May to Mercury 's departure on the 30th June , with a New Moon on the 5th June creating a chance for new beginnings and opportunities . <h> Money <p> From the moment Uranus returned to your financial sector in 2011 he 's been in the wrong place at the wrong time or so it may have seemed at times , in opposition with Saturn in your income sector from the moment he returned , under pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete with income forces for the past 2 years . In fact , it 's Mars ' departure from your income sector on the 4th January that finally brings a continuous run of planetary activity there that began in December 2013 to an end . However that constant , low level pressure that you could n't put your finger on , left when the lunar nodes left your two money houses on the 12th November 2015 . By the time you move into 2016 , while Mars is still in your income sector his opposition with Uranus and financial forces ended weeks earlier and has already transformed into motivation , allowing money and income matters to finally operate in their own lanes , for now anyway . Moving into the year with Mars in your income sector is going to see you begin with your fighting spirit engaged and while he 'll have you on your own after that , it 's midyear that your luckiest income year in over a decade begins , so hold onto the sense of resolve this leaves you with . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 20th March , to begin your annual financial review , there 'll be no planets or cosmic activity of any kind over on the other side of the sky and in opposition , meaning that the financial tension of the past is finally behind you .

This will also be a chance to revise your definition of financial success , not just during your annual financial review , but throughout much of the year . Things change dramatically when Venus returns to your income sector on the 30th August or will do under her watch , creating what is almost a year of two halves as far as financial matters are concerned .

Saturn , on the other hand , has been in your work sector since October 2012 and until he leaves on the 24th December this year , he 's forcing you to get real , put in the hard work and achieve the kind of determination , discipline and work focus that you did n't think you were capable of , doing whatever it takes for as long as it takes , doing things the hard way and putting in the hard slog .

The key to balancing income and money matters is the fact that Jupiter will remain in retrograde motion in your income sector until the 6th March , the very day that Venus leaves your financial sector , almost as though he 's taking a back seat and giving the queen of the money gods the center stage .

Normally spending around 6 weeks in your income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th January to the 6th March , but will then retrograde for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August , in total spending just under 19 weeks instead of his normal 6 weeks here . 2016 is also an important and well supported year for home and family matters , more so than is normally the case and in fact , it 's the challenges of the past that are set to reveal themselves as the stepping stones to all the great things set to develop here this year . <h> Love <p> You 're in a situation where , with Uranus in your relationship sector from 2011 to 2019 there is always going to be focus on your relationships , however how you experience that will depend a lot on the conditions at the time and for the last few years things have been more challenging . Ever since returning Uranus has found himself at odds with many of the other planets and while this started to clear last year , with the South Node here from February 2014 to November 2015 it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner the North Node in your sign at the same time , there had been subtle personal and/or relationship tension that would have become the norm , in an effort to maintain a balance between your personal and relationship needs . The real impact of the South Node 's departure last November is only just being felt in the early days of the year , with Uranus ' direct turn on the 26th December finally allowing you and your relationships to start moving on . Your relationships have no major challenges and are n't under pressure this year and instead have the support of Saturn in your relationship sector all year and from Mars for part of the year . Normally moving through your communication sector in just 6 weeks every other year , Mars will move through from the 6th March to the 28th May and again from the 3rd August to the 27th September . With the Sun , Mercury and Venus all moving through your relationship sector between the 20th March and the 30th April , Mars and Saturn will be on hand to give your relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have support all year , but the times of year that are conducive to love and romance are looking good , unlike the roadblocks last year . Ceres spent a lot of time in your romantic sector last year , moving through from the 4th April to the 4th August 2015 , then returning at the end of October , where she still is as you move into the New Year . Ceres is a dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system and she 's here to get right to the heart of your romantic needs . It 's when Mercury returns on the 2nd January that there is more practical romantic support and between him , the Sun , Venus and Ceres they 'll keep the romantic flame burning right through to the 12th March . Venus will even return on the 8th December , making the early months and final weeks of the year the most romantically charged . <h> Business <p> After the work tension in the second half of 2015 you might be wondering what 2016 is going to throw at you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that in the final year of a 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion the wind has been taken out of your sails , that you 've been forced to work smarter , which is ultimately working to your advantage . There will never be a moment that work matters are ticking away behind the scenes , not with Chiron in your work sector until 2019 and Neptune until 2026 , however while this is the baseline there are periods of the year that are more active than others and periods where things dial right back . The most active points of any year for work matters are when the Sun , Mercury and Venus move through your work sector , aligning with the major forces behind the scenes and because you 're not getting a cold start , can trigger a lot of progress and developments . In the other extreme , in retrograde motion from June to November each year this is when you need to pull right back . This is usually just as the most active months in any year for career and income matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work matters . It was while Neptune and Chiron were in retrograde motion last year that they got pummelled by a whole series of oppositions , yet it 's from that , that you 've learnt the power of working smarter . As you move into 2016 Neptune and Chiron are still in their early months in direct motion , the pace not really picking up on the work front until the Sun returns on the 19th February . However Mars , one of the planets responsible for the work tension in the second half of 2015 , obviously feels that you 're owed some payback , for while he 'll return to your income sector from the 4th January to the 6th March , here when the Sun returns to kick things off on the work front this sets the scene for some of the best weeks of the year for income and work matters . The best weeks of the year for work matters run from the Sun 's arrival on the 19th February to Venus ' departure on the 6th April , but it 's a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work sector since 1998 , that creates the potential for some major new beginnings , just 6 days after Mars ' departure from your income sector . Mars will return to your income sector for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August and while his first visit coincided with the start of the most active weeks of the year for work matters , it will completely envelope the most active weeks of 2016 for career matters . With no ongoing planetary activity in your career sector what you have is a short window of opportunity where the professional gods are able to get in and make things happen and this year that window is incredibly small , but the timing could n't be better . From Venus ' return to your career sector on the 18th June to the Sun 's departure 5 weeks later on the 22nd July , all the planetary activity for the year will play out , but with Mars back in your income sector from the 28th May to the 3rd August they overlap to perfection . Remembering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those 5 weeks could be some of the most stunning weeks of 2016 for income , work and career matters . <h> Money <p> With Saturn having wrapped up his nearly 3 year visit to your income sector last September and your annual update having run its course when Venus left on the 30th December 2015 , this should be a fairly low key year for income matters and for financial matters as well . However , it seems that income forces have far from run their course and rather than needing more time to let things play out , are set over the course of the year to make the previous year 's count . The Sun , Mercury and Venus , who move through your income sector once a year , will always put the spotlight on income matters and that will be the case when the Sun returns on the 23rd October , Venus on the 24th October and Mercury on the 25th October , arriving for a short update that will run its course by the 13th November . However , it 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on income matters this year and more what will happen between Venus ' departure on the 30th December 2015 and the Sun 's return on the 23rd October , for it 's during that time that Mars is set to go to town . It begins with Mars ' return on the 4th January , just 5 days after Venus ' departure and while the warrior planet of the cosmos will spend 6 months in your income sector every other year , this year he 'll spend over 3 times that long . Mars will first move through from the 4th January to the 6th March , but a retrograde turn will see him come back for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August , creating some of the best glass ceiling shattering conditions in years . Saturn has spent the last 3 years constructing ladders and helping you to get over your fear of heights , all in preparation for Mars ' return . Mars is rather clever in that he will leave your income sector on the 6th March and wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here during the majority of your annual financial review . The Sun will move through your financial sector from the 20th April to the 21st May , putting the solar spotlight on your financial situation and money matters , giving you a chance to take care of any financial housekeeping , With Venus here from the 30th April to the 24th May your financial confidence should be high by the time Mars returns to your income sector on the 28th May . However Mercury , who returns for what should be a 15 day visit to your financial sector on the 6th April , will still be here and not leaving until the 13th June this could see financial tensions flare up when Mars returns , but on both sides of the fence this will create some real motivation . 4689 @qwx624689 4690 @qwx624690 <h> About Libra <p> Libra is good at relationships .

@@73187138 @1887138/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> When you look to the dynamics of a year itself and how to sum it up you look to the major planets and not only where they are , but their relationship with each other . One look at the relationship between the major players this year reveals a lot of harmony and a year that should be a good year on a number of levels , which is a nice change from a series of very challenging years . Yes , life will go on and there will always be challenges that need to be faced , which after all is part of being human , but when the year itself has a positive and harmonious energy , that helps a lot . When you dig down you find a very powerful year for money matters , something that you 're still adjusting to as you move into the New Year , for until just before Christmas you were performing your annual financial reality checks and updates and then the next minute you had one of the most powerful forces in the solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your back as well . Saturn , the hard task master of the cosmos returned to your financial sector on Christmas Eve and apart from the 3 months he 'll take off from the 15th June to the 18th September , he 's here until December 2017 , on a mission to see you take your power back , forcing you to take responsibility for financial and money matters , but in the process giving you the power to move mountains if you have to . In this mission Saturn has a powerful ally in the form of lucky Jupiter , who from his position in your home and family sector is lending a helping hand , making the first half of the year an especially important , expansive year for home and family matters , but especially when it comes to financial matters on the home , family and/or property fronts . Saturn does n't hand out free lunches and you have to work for everything you get , but he makes sure you get what you deserve and what you 've earned .

It was Saturn 's departure from your relationship sector on Christmas Eve that brought a fairly challenging few years to an end , but only because this raised the bar and forced you to confront relationship issues and invest into your relationships what you need back . While Saturn will return between the 15th June and the 18th September , it will be more a chance to take care of any housekeeping .

Apart from a Full Moon in your romantic sector on the 6th March , in your relationship sector on the 4th May and Venus , planet of love 's visit to your sign from the 18th March to the 21st April , the first half of the year is fairly uneventful , with nothing that sets this year apart from any other year . To a degree that 's what you want , for it means the pressure is no longer on your relationships and chances are you would have settled for that . It 's midyear that the love gods decide that things have been too serious for too long , for it 's then that something extraordinary and utterly romantic starts to develop . The first clues are Venus ' early return to your romantic sector on the 19th July and the fact that she 'll retrograde back out just 13 days later , realising she 's returned to the party too soon . However , these 13 days and especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to your heart , tapping into the spirit of romance in preparation for what comes next .

Between August and October the love gods will throw everything they have at getting this lucky year for love off the ground . <h> Business <p> While your professional year will begin with a bang and moving into the New Year with Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos in your career sector your professional passions and fighting spirit will be engaged from the get go , the year is n't going to stay at that level .

With Venus returning to your career sector on the 4th January , Mercury on the 5th January and the Sun on the 20th January those recourses will kick in before Mars even leaves , but it 's then that you 'll be able to play a more strategic game . Venus will leave your career sector on the 28th January and wo n't return until 2016 , so it 's the early weeks of your professional year where the laws of attraction are going to be in effect , both in terms of attracting opportunities and attention your way .

@@73187139 @1887139/ <h> 2016 Overview <p> 2016 brings with it a lot of stability but also a lot of the foundation work already completed . Jupiter , who will spend until September in your work sector , bringing the potential for growth , expansion and success on the work front has been here since August 2015 with the North Node , a force that will keep things in motion here from November 2015 to May 2017 . In partnership with career forces , that have been preparing for this year for several years and an added push in the early and later months of the year , what you have is an opportune professional year , with the potential for growth and big developments on both the work and career fronts . Missing last year were the income opportunities that will come from this , with the money gods doing their best to create income opportunities during a period that begins on the 6th April and runs through to the 13th June . It 's here that there is the potential for some unexpected income developments , especially in the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days either side . Meanwhile , while Mars will spend an extraordinary amount of time in your financial sector this year , spread over 2 visits , this is not a repeat of the financial challenges of the past , something you 're now able to benefit from . It was Saturn 's departure from your financial sector in September 2015 that brought a 3 year financial boot camp to an end and with your annual financial review starting just weeks later , you 've had a chance to take care of any financial housekeeping . Mars will return to your financial sector on the 4th January and while he 'll leave on the 6th March , having spent weeks fuelling your financial passions and fighting spirit , he 'll return for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August . This is an opportunity for some financial rebuilding . 2016 is also a huge year for spreading your wings and experiencing life to the full , whether through travel , study or simply moving out of your comfort zone . This is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you try and hide behind old excuses . This will come into its own when you move into your birthday month and new solar year in March , as you realise that the year in front of you has none of the old rules or constraints , unleashing a sense of freedom and liberation that will stay with you for the rest of the year . Gone are the relationship pressures of recent years , but these will turn into a blessing in disguise when Jupiter returns to your relationship sector in September , kicking off your most important relationship year in over a decade , one that will take until October 2017 to play out . While 2016 does n't have the romantic influences that the first 9 months of 2015 held , this year will see those same forces mature into something that is now ready for relationship building . However , Jupiter and August will be the best months of the year for matters of the heart and all things fun , playful , romantic and creative . <h> Love <p> After the push that the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and first half of 2015 , their attention turns to relationship matters this year or at least it will as the year progresses . It has been a busy and at time challenging few years for both the love and relationship gods and they want nothing better than to let things settle , to begin with anyway . It was in early October 2015 that a massive 15 month romantic push ended and in November 2015 that a battle between your personal and relationship needs also ran its course . This is when Venus and Mars , the planets of love and passion came onto the scene and while Venus left your relationship sector in December 2014 , as you move into the New Year Mars is still here , wrapping up a massive push to define what you want from your relationships and what they need from you , one that began in December 2013 . To start with it 's a case of processing what has been a game changing few years on both the romantic and relationship fronts , absorbing a new sense of what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in preparation for Jupiter 's return to your relationship sector on the 9th September , opening the door to your biggest , best and most important year for relationship building in over a decade , one that will put the challenges of the past into perspective . There will be plenty of preparation for this , starting with a lunar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 24th March , though the relationship gods will begin their campaign when Venus returns on the 30th August , at which point you 'll have continuous support right through to late 2017 . While romantic matters do n't get as much attention this year , with the groundwork already completed and a clearer sense of what you want from love , when opportunities arise you 'll know exactly how to seize them . Apart from a romantically charged Full Moon on the 24th January April is set to be a romantically charged month , with the most romantic charged months of the year being July and August , just as the relationship gods are lining up for their turn . <h> Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 5 months of 2015 preparing for , but in reality probably much longer than that , instead as far back as 2008 . That was the year that Pluto returned to your career sector , on a mission to see you evolve professionally to become all you can be and to explore your full potential , a mission that wo n't run its course until 2024 . Yet during the 16 years that Pluto will spend in your career sector there are many seasons you 'll travel through and until now , while there have been pockets of support along the way , with August/September always good months for work matters and the closing and early weeks of each year good for career matters , for the most part there have been more challenges than opportunities . That all changed on the 11th August 2015 when Jupiter , planet of luck and expansion returned to your work sector for the first time since 2004 , opening the door to your luckiest and most expansive year for work opportunities , grow and developments in over a decade , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally Pluto and career forces have the support they need and it 's the kind that wo n't wax and wane , remaining solid even after Jupiter leaves your work sector in September . For it was in November 2015 , just after a parade of planets moving through your work sector left , that the North Node returned here for the first time in 17 years , providing a clear sense of direction and a natural current that will keep work matters on track until mid 2017 . This is the first time you 've had Jupiter and the North Node , the two most auspicious forces in the solar system , in your work sector at the same time in 35 years , enjoying the support of Pluto and all that the professional momentum gained over the last 8 years . As Pluto 's return to your career sector in 2008 was the first since the 18th Century , this is his first visit in our lifetime , so it 's with no exaggeration that 2016 can be considered the most important and potentially successful of your professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year 's professional lotto , but the decade 's possible lotto . Within this there will still be the same pockets of extra support and for work matters that will run from the 31st July to the 7th October , while the year will begin with some very active forces in play on the career front , right through to 17th February , picking up again with a vengeance on the 27th September , just days after Jupiter 's departure from your work sector on the 9th September , staying at that high right through to early 2017 . Best of all 2016 is also destined to be a lucrative year for income opportunities . <h> Money <p> When Saturn left your financial sector last September he wrapped up a nearly 3 year financial boot camp , one that wo n't be repeated for another 3 decades . While this may have been challenging , you 've learned more about money management and taking control of your own financial destiny than you have in years , if not decades . While Saturn is gone and wo n't be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to let things go just yet with Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos and your ruling planet spending an extraordinary amount of time here this year , firing up your financial passions and fighting spirit and giving you a chance to capitalise on all you 've learned over recent years and the authentic new starting point this created . While you 'll move into the New Year with no planets in either of your money houses , for the first time since 2011 , with Venus having just left on the 30th December your financial confidence , desires , expectations and a sense of entitlement will be high from the get go . It 's Mars ' return on the 4th January , after both Saturn 's 3 year financial boot camp and your 2015 annual financial review have run their course , that is set to fire up your financial passions and fighting spirit , giving you a chance to take all that experience and run with it . Normally here for just 6 weeks , his first visit since 2013 is a chance to start taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6th March he will have already spent just under 9 weeks here , but it 's his retrograde turn weeks later that will see him return for a double dip visit , spending a further 10 weeks here , from the 28th May to the 3rd August . With so much potential to work with , it 's no wonder Mars will want to stay around . Mars will be gone by the time Sun , Venus and Mercury return to begin your annual financial review within the space of 3 days , from the 23rd October to the 25th October , but they 'll have a head start . While there is n't as much activity in your income sector the months when things are active are likely to be very lucrative , thanks to the fact that you have lucky Jupiter in your work sector until the 9th September , along with yearlong support from Pluto in your career sector . The most active and potentially lucrative income weeks run from the 6th April to the 13th June , with the potential for some surprise developments around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period the most lucrative days will run from the 30th April to the 24th May . 4689 @qwx624689 4692 @qwx624692 <h> About Aries <p> Aries is good at fighting the good fight . Headstrong and impetuous , you rush in where angels dare not tread . Ruled by the planet Mars , you love to get in first anyway , and winning is important . The good Aries never backs down from a challenge . If anyone weaker needs to be protected , or an ideal needs to be defended , you are right there at the head of the column , and will fight to the end to see that Right prevails . <p> The trouble is that Aries does n't always know what is right - bigger , noisier and better armed is not necessarily better . Winning is great , but not at the expense of honor . Make sure the cause is worth your zeal because things get downright ugly when you go to the dark side and start to fight just for the sake of it . 
@@73187140 @1887140/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> What sets 2015 apart from other years is n't the fact that you 've reached your most important relationship year in 3 decades , something you 're just easing into as you move into the New Year , not just that this is an exceptionally fortunate year for communication or that this is also an important year for friendship , but that all three are so closely connected . The two planets that shape the year itself are Jupiter and Saturn , one bringing the opportunities and the other the challenges , though in a way where opportunities can present as challenges and challenges as opportunities . It 's in the first half of the year especially , with Saturn making his first visit to your relationship sector in 3 decades and lucky Jupiter in your communication sector , that the two are working together to create something special . With help and support from Uranus in your friendship sector , what you have on your hands is one of the most important years for friendship and relationship building in some time , so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or strengthened this year are likely to remain close for the rest of your life and/or they 'll completely redefine what you expect from your friendships and relationships forevermore . While , apart from a 3 month period between the 15th June and the 18th September , Saturn will remain in your relationship sector until December 2017 , going back to check on things on the work front during those months , Jupiter will leave your communication sector in August . It 's then that a whole new area of your life opens up and if Jupiter represents where your luck lies in 2015 , then this is a year of two halves . While your luck wo n't change on the communication front once Jupiter leaves , especially if you 're committed to keeping the communication lines open , it 's on the 11th August that your most important , expansive and opportune year for home , family and/or property matters begins , one that will take you right through to September 2016 . One theme threading its way through the year in a subtle but defining way will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that will touch every aspect of your life as you realise that it 's all about the journey . <h> Love <p> The love gods made 2014 a year for matters of the heart and all things romantic , even if at times it was for all the wrong reasons . However , thanks to Mars ' 8 month visit to your romantic sector , his longest in 32 years and the 9 months Ceres spent defining your real romantic needs , while the love gods wo n't focus too much on matters of the heart until the final 3 months of the year , you already know what you want from love and how to keep the romantic momentum going . This is n't something the love gods will put too many resources behind , but they are creating a natural current that will make it easy for you to take up that responsibility . The love gods do n't have much time to focus on matters of the heart this year because they 're focused on your relationships instead , with 2015 not only your most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of a 3 year journey that will take until December 2017 to run its course . Everything changes on Christmas Eve , when just 2 days after the Sun left your relationship sector and ended last year 's relationship update and review Saturn returned , for the first time since 1987 . Saturn is here to take your relationships to a whole new level and as you 're likely to move into the New Year with a clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you , there 'll be no excuses to hide behind . There is no hiding the fact that having Saturn in your relationship sector can be challenging , for it 's impossible to sweep things under the carpet , stick your head in the sand or settle for the status quo , but because of that you have a chance to build strong , enduring and authentic relationships . Saturn will take a break from the 15th June to the 18th September , when he 'll retrograde out and give things a chance to settle , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole new level . This makes communication essential all year , but especially with both matters of the heart and your relationships requiring your full attention in the final 3 months of the year . <h> Business <p> After a very active few years on both the work and career fronts the theme continues this year , though in a lot less demanding way . Your career sector has been continuously active since 2003 and will remain active until the main current inhabitant Neptune , planet of dreams and fantasies leaves in 2026 , making this the most continuously active area of your chart . It 's been many years since you 've had a chance to take your professional hat off and many years before you 'll have a chance to again , but when you have this kind of activity here this makes this the norm and the wallpaper to your life and it 's only when the faster moving planets move through that anything over and above the norm comes into play . The most active months of any year for career matters will always be February/March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this year things kick off a little earlier with Mars ' return on the 13th January . The professional gods will allow you some time off over the holiday period , but 2 weeks into 2015 and you 'll need to be on your toes , with Mars fuelling your professional passions and fighting spirit during a visit that will not only run until the 20th February , but will see much of what will define your 2015 professional year play out . Between Mars ' return on the 13th January and Mercury 's departure on the 31st March most of what will define this professional year will be invested , including a total solar eclipse on the 20th March , one that could bring some major , unexpected new opportunities . What is missing as you move into the new year is the relentless work ethic and requirements of the past 2 years for while Saturn , hard task master of the cosmos , had been in your work sector since October 2012 , he left just before Christmas , allowing you to move into the New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major new opportunities opening up in the first 3 months of the year . Saturn will return to your work sector from the 15th June to the 18th September , but this will be during a review phase on the career front and for a visit that is aimed at tying up loose ends and making sure that no stone has been left uncovered or issue unresolved . This will clear the way for new work opportunities and developments which will open up from the 24th October to the 30th December . <h> Money <p> While there will never be a point of the year where you do n't have your money hat on , not with Pluto in your financial sector from 2008 to 2024 , 2015 is destined to be a lot less intense than the last 2 years and in fact this is when you 'll get to enjoy the benefits of all that this stirred and forced you to confront . It was lucky Jupiter 's yearlong visit to your income sector , from June 2013 to July 2014 that should have and did create some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits from , but it also brought a lot of financial tension . This came from the fact that Jupiter and Pluto were not only in opposition with each other for most of that time , they were both under pressure from external forces . Yet what you saw as financial tension and challenges has actually created a lot of progress , something that you 're able to benefit from in the early weeks of the year when it comes to financial and money matters , with income opportunities opening up from early May onwards . You will always move into the New Year with the spotlight on your financial situation and money matters , with the Sun always spending the first 3 weeks of January in your financial sector . Yet with Mars having left in December 2014 , Venus leaving on the 4th January , Mercury on the 5th January and the Sun on the 20th January , the early weeks of the year are the most important for cementing your financial objectives for the coming year , putting things on the path you want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your financial sector this year , moving through from the 9th January to the 4th April and then again from the 4th August to the 28th October , you 'll have a chance to redefine your financial priorities as the year progresses . It 's when the planets start returning to your income sector , for the first time since lucky Jupiter left that get to benefit from the seeds already planted and the untapped potential this left you with . The most lucrative weeks of the year will run from Venus ' return to your income sector on the 8th May to Mars ' departure on the 9th August . 4689 @qwx624689 <p> Relationship Compatibility detailing how each of you perceives and experiences the other , examining the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship and pinpointing potential problems .

@@73187142 @1887142/ <h> 2016 Overview <p> The two planets that influence any given year , over and above the wallpaper that has been in place for the year and the annual pattern that any year will go through , are Jupiter and Saturn and in both cases the move into 2016 is to be seamless , with both continuing what they began last year . It was lucky Jupiter 's return to your communication sector in August that has given your relationships a major boost and while there may have been some challenges in his early months , this was the push that you needed to get through any communication barriers . With the communication and relationship gods working together , 2016 is set to be a big year on both fronts . You can also expect 2016 to be a busy and successful year , for when Jupiter visits this area of your chart , which he does once every 12 years , he spends around 12 months expanding your mind , ideas and your ability to tackle things smartly , multitask and in general shine in all that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll retain that edge , though this is when your most important , opportune and expansive year for home , family and/or property matters in over a decade begins , one that will extend out to late 2017 . This is when you may also see some of the work/life balance issues of the past return , for the professional gods are under the impression that they own this year and for very good reason . This makes the first 8 months of the year especially important for working with Mars , who is going to make a valiant attempt to find and maintain a balance between work and play , though in fits and starts . With Uranus spending the whole of 2016 in your career sector and Saturn his first , last and only full year in your work sector in 3 decades and these two cosmic neighbours working closely together , you really do have a huge professional year , one where there wo n't be a moment where you wo n't need to have your work and professional hats on . There will be times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April and May , then again in August and September , only to come back with a vengeance in November and December . It 's Mars ' return to a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart from the 4th January to the 5th March that will see a battle begin to find a balance between work and play , one that he 'll return to from the 28th May to the 3rd August . While the professional gods will be doing their best to make the best of what is without a doubt a huge year for work and career matters playful , adventurous and forces close to home will also be doing their best to ensure that the year does n't become all work and no play . <h> Love <p> This is a year where you need to expect the unexpected , for while on face value things look as they should , the fact that you 're moving into the New Year with romantic influences in play is a clue that the love gods are putting up a fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relationship matters over recent years , unfortunately not always for the right reasons . Pluto , in your relationship sector from 2008 to 2024 , has been under some serious pressure over recent years , at odds with many of the major planets in the solar system , putting your relationships under pressure . At the same time , when Saturn left your romantic sector in September 2015 he brought a 3 year romantic boot camp to an end and while you emerged with a clear sense of what you want from love , having survived love 's battlefield you may be wary of going there again . Things started to get better for Pluto and your relationships as the planets started to return to your communication sector in August , as they do at that time every year , something that is always a temporary advantage . However , while most of the planets moved on lucky Jupiter has stayed and together with the North Node they 're providing Pluto and your relationships with the best support they 've had in decades . With the Sun always spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector this will bring the kind of reality checks that reveal the real dynamics in play , which is when you 'll get your first sense that maybe things will be different this year . A New Moon in your relationship sector on the 10th January will bring an opportunity to commit to your relationships , the future and the journey ahead , with support right through to the 17th February invest as much as possible into your relationships . Romantic matters should have to wait until later in the year for their turn , with Venus ' departure on the 30th December 2015 bringing things to a close . However , it 's Mars ' return on the 4th January that begins an extraordinary journey , almost flying in the face of relationship forces , on his own romantic crusade . Mars spends around 6 weeks in your romantic sector every other year but this year he 'll return on the 4th January and leave on the 6th March , but will have a change of mind and will retrograde back in for a double dip visit from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your romantic sector on the 24th September , between them they 'll manage to keep the romantic flame and the romantic passions burning in a year that sees romantic forces sneakily steal more attention than they should . <h> Business <p> Not all years are created equal and this is far from an ordinary year , with the professional gods dialling up a better than average year for career matters and a huge , but also busy year for work matters . Since Uranus returned to your career sector in 2011 the laws of synchronicity have been in effect , but not due to leave until March 2019 , it 's been 5 years since you 've had a chance to take your professional hats off and it will be another 3 years until you get another chance . However , Uranus is a planet that will operate in the background , with the last few years not truly giving him or you a chance . Under pressure for much of his time here and with the South Node here from February 2014 to November 2015 it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , during his time here in your career sector Uranus will always spend from July to December in retrograde motion and it was his direct turn on the 26th December that saw the professional tide turn just days before you moved into 2016 . The pattern that you have come to expect over recent years is that a busy end to each year will have run its course by the end of each year , sometimes remaining active into the New Year and then you 'd have a few months before the faster planets returned to your career sector , where Uranus would be waiting and you 'd have a good few weeks for career matters . To a degree that is the case this year , with Uranus slowly gaining speed during the early months of the year , becoming more active from the Sun 's return on the 20th March to Venus ' departure on the 30th April . It 's during this 6 week period that the Sun , Mercury and Venus will move through , with a New Moon on the 8th April an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to that Ceres , dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system will spend an extraordinary amount of time here , returning from the 15th April to the 17th July , leaving but then retrograding back in from the 13th October to the 5th February 2017 . In all Ceres will spend 30 weeks , not so much triggering professional opportunities but working to completely redefine your definition of professional success , with a chance to establish what you 're really striving for . Everything that will transpire on the career front this year will play out against the backdrop of some major developments on the work front , with Saturn spending his first and only full year in your work sector in 3 decades . While Saturn will give you the power to move mountains if you have to , even if it is one shovel at a time , he 'll have an extraordinary amount of help from Mars , who spent just under 20 weeks in your work sector this year , split over two visits . Mars will move through from the 6th March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal 6 weeks firing up your work passions , fighting and competitive spirit and making things happen . As fate should have it , this is during the most important weeks of the year for career matters . Mars will retrograde back in for a double dip visit from the 3rd August to the 27th September , firing things up again , each time adding fuel to Saturn 's goliath like strength and sheer power to move mountains if you have to . With Venus returning to your work sector on the 18th October to kick off this year 's normal quota of support on the work front , this gives an already powerful year for work matters a chain of support . What makes this an even bigger professional year is that Saturn and Uranus will be working as a team , creating a major year for both work and career matters , one of the best and most important in your professional life time . <h> Money <p> Compared to previous years there is not a lot of activity on either the financial or income fronts this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially as you 're only now starting to benefit from all that has transpired over recent years . It was Jupiter 's first visit to your income sector in 12 years and last for another 12 years that run from July 2014 to August 2015 and with Venus spending nearly 4 months there , by the time she finally left in October 2015 she brought an active 15 months to an end . Now if you 're wondering where your share of that luck has gone , it 's not only after Jupiter is gone that the real benefits of what has been planted are revealed , but in your case you 've had to wait for the right professional conditions . This began with the Sun and Mercury 's return to your work sector in November and while they 're both gone , with Venus having returned on the 30th December , just 4 days after Uranus ' direct turn in your career sector , you 're only just starting to peak professionally as you move into the New Year . While Venus will leave your work sector on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2017 and Mars spending an extraordinary amount of time here this year and career matters also well supported this year , while the charge is being led by the professional gods there will be a lot of untapped income potential . For this reason , while the most lucrative income weeks are contained within a period from the 12th July to the 23rd August , every professional breakthrough brings the potential for untapped income potential . This means that while there will be fresh income opportunities generated , especially in July and August , most opportunities will come from what has already been invested or set in motion . In the meantime , the early months of any year will also see the focus on money matters , but this year you have an advantage . Ceres spent an extraordinary amount of time in your financial sector in 2015 , having moved through from early April to early August , only to return on the 29th October , still here as you move into the New Year .

After returning to your sign in October 2012 and here until 2015 , Saturn will spend the whole year in your sign , giving you the strength and the confidence to claim your power back . It 's Jupiter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June and Neptune 's position in a fun , romantic and creative part of your chart all year that makes this a year to really start living the life you were meant to live , with all 3 demanding that you get down from life 's spectator stands and get back onto the playing field . <p> Love : The love gods are making this an important year on both the romantic and relationship fronts , but whereas the forces on the relationship front are more subtle , romantic forces will be impossible to miss . For the first time in your lifetime you will move into the New Year with Neptune , planet of dreams and fantasies in your romantic sector and while he 's been here since February 2012 , you 're able to use last year as a practice run , moving into the New Year with the planet that dares you to dream and to believe that anything is possible . With some heavy duty support from some of the major players in the cosmos , Neptune is urging you to move into the New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait long to see signs that your confidence is n't ill founded , when from Mars ' return to your romantic sector from the 2nd February to Mercury 's departure on the 14th April , you 'll experience the most romantically charged months of the year and the chance to start turning dreams into reality . However , with Neptune here until 2026 there is no urgent need to get it right , for this support is now in place for years to come . It 's just 6 days after this romantic chapter runs its course that things will start to move on the relationship front , beginning with the Sun and Mars ' return on the 20th April and running its course on the 31st May . This is n't a long time but a lot will be packed into this period , including a solar eclipse on the 10th May that brings the promise of new beginnings and will bring the element of fate into play . You will find that the door to the past will remain open on the relationship front all year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will decide which doors to open and when . While things will never quite go off the boil on the romantic and relationship fronts , with the main thrust over by the 31st May , it 's the early months of the year that are the most important . Venus , planet of love will move through your sign from the 11th September to the 8th October , bringing a second wave of planetary support and a chance for the love gods to once again become actively engaged . <p> Money : With Jupiter spending the first half of the year in your financial sector , in what is the second half of his 12 month visit aimed at getting your financial situation on the right track , there is a lot of focus on your financial situation this year . While Jupiter is the planet of luck and expansion and this is your luckiest and most expansive financial year in over a decade , do n't be surprised if it does n't feel that way going into the New Year . With Jupiter in retrograde motion until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a head at the end of 2012 , this may even feel like a challenging financial time . Yet sometimes Jupiter has to strip back before he can rebuild , with most of your financial opportunities coming together between Venus ' return to your financial sector on the 10th May and Mars ' departure on the 14th July . During that time Venus , Mercury , Mars and the Sun will all do their part to bring Jupiter 's legacy home , with Mars and his financial passions and fighting spirit staying on the job long after Jupiter leaves on the 26th June . While there is n't any ongoing planetary activity in your income sector you will begin and end the year on a high note , with the early weeks and later months of the year likely to be the best . While you 'll move into the year with Mercury and Venus in your income sector , allowing you to start the year with a smart head for money , some clear intentions and the laws of attraction in effect , this is more a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury will leave your income sector on the 1st January and Venus on the 9th January , after which point , apart from a lunar eclipse on the 25th May , you 're on your own . This eclipse is likely to be a catchall for all things initiated over the previous 12 months , with some potentially unexpected developments or income gains . After that you 'll need to wait until the second half of the year , with Venus ' return to your income sector from the 8th October to the 5th November , the Sun 's from the 22nd November to the 22nd December and Mercury 's from the 5th December to the 25th December , bringing some of the most lucrative months of the year . <p> Business : Since Uranus , planet of surprise and synchronicity returned to your work sector in 2010 he 's been working to keep you on track , to keep your options open and just when and where you least expect , to bring surprise developments that could see things completely change tack and it will stay that way until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in 2013 or for many years to come that things will ever go off the boil and while Uranus may step into the background in quieter times of the year he 's always on the job , always ready to jump out and surprise you . That 's why it 's important not to move into 2013 with a game plan , because that runs the risk of developing tunnel vision or becoming so committed to it being your way or the highway , that Uranus is unable to operate effectively . Uranus rules through the laws of synchronicity , those that put you in the right place at the right time for serendipitous moments or encounters and those Eureka moments that in a heartbeat can change everything . Uranus only turned direct in December 2012 , so in the early days of the year he 's moving slowly and in no hurry , though with your income sector still active in the early days of the year there is likely to be a lot more confidence and the ability to use the momentum you have effectively . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front until Mars reaches your work sector on the 11th March , you can afford to pace yourself and if you do this will allow you to keep pace with Uranus ' slow increase in speed . A slow and steady start to your new working year does not mean you have a slow and steady year on your hands , with things becoming busy soon enough , just not all at once and right away . Your busiest point in the year will be when Uranus is joined by the Sun , Mercury , Venus and Mars as they move through your work sector , which they will do in a very short and frenetic 7-week period that kicks off with Mars ' return on the 11th March and ends with Mercury 's departure on the 2nd May . It 's in that period that a New Moon on the 10th April will create the potential for new beginnings or opportunities . After that Uranus is on his own for the rest of the year , however there may be some surprise developments around the time of a lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time since 1994 you 'll move into the year with the Moon in your career sector and your professional instincts sharp , with the Moon coming full circle to form a Full Moon here on the 27th January . However , it 's not until the middle months of the year that the focus will shift to career matters and your professional situation as a whole . A very active career phase will begin with Venus ' return to your career sector on the 28th June and wo n't run its course until Mars leaves on the 16th October . 4689 @qwx624689 4690 @qwx624690 <h> About Scorpio <p> Scorpio is good at passion .

@@73187145 @1887145/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> It 's not very often that you 're told to make following your heart a priority and a necessity but that 's exactly what Saturn , hard task master of the cosmos is doing this year and it 's something he 's got a lot of help and support with . This is when the challenge to find the right balance between work and play in the closing months of 2014 and the early weeks of 2015 comes into its own , for what you have is a year where the element of fun and adventure are set to become a priority , but also where you 're finally coming into your own . As you move into the New Year you 're halfway through the foundation year of a 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion , with the planet of luck having returned to your sign in July 2014 . Not due to leave until the 11th August , this is one of your luckiest years in over a decade , but it 's less about random strokes of luck and more about laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What makes this such an exciting year is the support that Jupiter has , especially when it comes to getting excited about the journey ahead . Throughout his time in your sign Jupiter is enjoying the support of Uranus in your sector of travel , adventure , learning and discovery , support that will only intensify in the early months of this year and especially between February and May . However , Jupiter also has support from Saturn , who on Christmas Eve returned to a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart , for the first time since 1988 . While Saturn will retrograde back into your home and family sector for 3 months , from the 15th June to the 18th September to help take care of any business there , once he returns he 's here until December 2017 . With Uranus in an adventurous part of your chart until 2019 , these two large and power planets , neighbours in the solar system , are committing both this year and the next few years to the pursuit of matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this the year for breaking out of your rut and no matter your reality , responsibility or circumstances , to really start living life to the full . <h> Love <p> Let 's face it , you 've been let down in both the love and relationship department over recent years , not because you 've had to face challenges and more because , apart from the annual updates the love gods bring each year , you 've been forced to plod along , on your own . That all changes this year and in a major and game changing way . For the first time in 27 years you 'll move into the New Year with Saturn in your romantic sector and while he 's the hard task master of the cosmos , he 's here to ensure you do n't hide behind your excuses , that you take matters of the heart seriously and to give you the power to move mountains if you have to . Saturn returned on Christmas Eve to start what would ultimately become a 3 year journey , one that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus , Mercury , Mars and Ceres all moved through your romantic sector in the later months of 2014 , so while Saturn is on his own as you move into the New Year you 're doing so with a clear sense of what you want from love , what you 're fighting for and what you need to commit to and take responsibility for . Saturn will retrograde back out for a few months from the 15th June to the 18th September , giving you a chance to let things settle , before the Sun , Mercury and Venus all return to your romantic sector over November/December and into the early weeks of 2016 . Yet with last year 's massive push having just ended on the 22nd December 2014 , you 've got enough momentum and romantic spirit to carry things forward . If you 're going to make New Year resolutions then focus on matters of the heart , for this really is your most powerful and important year for matters of the heart and the spirit of romance in 3 decades . In the early weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship forces , for you 'll not only move into the New Year with Mars in your relationship sector , but with Venus returning on the 4th January and Mercury on the 5th January there will be a push to make your relationships a priority from the get go . Even after the main relationship focus push for the year comes to an end in late February the love gods will keep a shadow force in play , keeping a watch over your relationships , especially when it comes to protecting your needs . <h> Business <p> Despite the fact that 2015 will get off to a busy start , it 's more a case that 2014 will overflow into the early weeks of 2015 , after which you have a relatively quiet year , with a very special reason why that 's important . Mars , planet of passion and the warrior planet of the cosmos moved through your work sector in late 2014 , but having left in December the drives , passions , fighting and competitive spirit that will take you into this new professional year have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 3 weeks of every year in your work sector , once he leaves on the 20th January Pluto , long term resident , will be back on his own and it will stay that way until the closing days of the year . Venus , who will leave your work sector on the 4th January wo n't return until 2016 , spending less than 96 hours of the year here , Mercury who will leave on the 5th January wo n't return until the 10th December and the Sun not until the 22nd December . You wo n't even have a New Moon in your work sector this year , having had one in late 2014 and the next not due until 2016 . While , with Pluto in your work sector from 2008 to 2024 , there 'll never be a chance to take your work hat off , his focus is long term evolution and growth and what you have is one of the least active years for work matters for a long time . Why this is important is that your work sector is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy year it can be exhausting , as was the case last year and chances are you need a year where you can get off the treadmill and spend time in the slow lane . However that does n't mean this wo n't be a successful year , for it means you 're able to put your time and energy into other areas , knowing that work matters can tick over , almost on cruise control . Those other matters are some very important months for career matters with Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos making his first visit to your career sector since 2013 . The most active and important weeks for career matters and new professional opportunities will run from Venus ' return to your career sector on the 18th March to the Sun 's departure on the 21st May , with Mercury and Mars returning during that time . However even then , while these will be an opportune few months for career matters , what this is preparing you for and why work matters are easing back , is that on the 11th August lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your luckiest and most potentially lucrative year in over a decade , a year that wo n't run its course until September 2016 . You 've put in the hard work over the last few years and now it 's time to reap the benefits . <h> Money <p> 2015 is a year that will come disguised as a very ordinary year for both income and money matters and if anything , simply a continuation of what has been in play last year , the year before and for several years for that matter . What is the norm is that you will move into the New Year with no planetary activity in your income sector , with August and September usually the most active months of the year for income matters and with Neptune and Chiron , long term residents in your financial sector , keeping financial matters on track , ahead of your annual financial review , which normally kicks off in February . It 's early in the New Year that you and normal ' will start parting company and by midyear it will be a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the income front . To start with the focus will remain on financial and money matters , with Mars ' return to your financial sector on the 13th January simply kicking things off early , firing up your financial passions and fighting spirit and then leaving on the 21st February , a day after the Sun will return to begin your annual update . From Mars ' return on the 13th January to Mercury 's departure on the 31st March you 'll experience the main push that financial matters get each year , albeit one that is likely to leave you feeling a lot more motivated . Then things will move back to normal but not for long , with Venus ' return to your income sector 19th July not only opening new doors on the income front a month earlier than is normally the case , but in a way that is going to prove game changing . It 's when Venus opens that door that you need to say goodbye to normal , as you wo n't see it again until mid 2016 . Venus will return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sensing the game changing developments about to open up , will retrograde back out 13 days later . By the time Venus returns for a double dip visit on the 9th October everything will have changed . While Mercury 's return to your income sector on the 8th August will give you a smart head for money needed to keep what Venus started in play , the game changer is that on the 11th August lucky Jupiter will return for the first time in 11 years , kicking off your luckiest and most lucrative income year in over a decade , one that will take until September 2016 to run its course . It 's Mars ' visit from the 25th September to the 13th November that will provide the means to smash through any glass ceilings , clearing a path for lucky Jupiter and the money gods . 4689 @qwx624689 4691 @qwx624691 <h> About Leo <p> Leo is good at being warm hearted , generous and kind .

@@73187146 @1887146/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> Very often the lines are blurred between one year and the next , with one seeming to flow into the next without any real point of difference ; however this is not one of those years . What is the norm for you is to end the year with a sense of adventure , a quest for freedom and to embrace the holiday spirit , only to somehow lose it by the time you move into the New Year , with the early months of each year usually spent with your professional hat on . While this will still be the case to a degree , this has been shrunk down to a point where the professional focus is likely to wane just 3 weeks into the New Year , while the spirit of adventure that does n't usually follow you into the New Year not only has but it 's taken on a life of its own . For while the Sun left your sector of travel , adventure , learning and discovery on the 22nd December , it was just 2 days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending all but 3 months out of the next 3 years here , he 's returned to ensure that simply going through the motions is no longer an option . This is something that he 's got help with , because for the first time since 2003 you 're also moving into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart , with the two most powerful planets in the solar system acting as the Fun Police from Day 1 . What you have is a lucky year for love , for matters of the heart , all things romantic and creative and a powerful year for adventure , with the courage to start moving out of your comfort zone and out of a rut . Yes , there will be times during the year where you 'll need to have your professional or money hats on , deal with family or relationship matters , but these responsibilities have shrunk down in size to a major degree this year to a point where they are part of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define what kind of year to expect , with one providing the opportunities and the other the planet we look to for where we need to take responsibility and this year the opportunities lie in following your heart and your responsibilities are living life to the full , creating one of your most exciting years in a very long time . It 's in the second half of the year that things become more work focused , but even then maintaining a balance between work and play needs to be a priority . <h> Love <p> Despite the fact that lucky Jupiter returned to your romantic sector last July to begin your luckiest year for love , matters of the heart and all things romantic in over a decade , this got high jacked by what was a defining and at times challenging year for relationship matters . As you move into 2015 you 're able to benefit from the fact that relationship matters are sorted and that you not only have a stable platform to rebuild or build on from , but it wo n't take much to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make up for lost time as they marshal all their resources to make 2015 a truly lucky and expansive year for love and all things romantic . In the early months of the year , with Jupiter in retrograde motion in your romantic sector until the 9th April there really is an opportunity to make up for lost time , with the doors open to second chances . It 's during this phase that Venus , planet of love will move through your sign from the 21st February to the 18th March , returning just 17 days after a Full Moon in your romantic sector on the 4th February is due to give matters of the heart a major push . It 's while Venus is in your sign that you 'll have a chance to define both your romantic and relationship desires and expectations for the coming year . It 's in the middle months of the year , from the 6th June onwards that the love gods come out from every corner of the cosmos to put their support behind matters of the heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their course until early October . Your relationships will get some attention , though not for the whole year as was the case in 2014 . This year , apart from a Full Moon on the 5th April that could bring relationship matters to a head , the love gods are making the final 3 months of the year the time to focus on your relationships . <h> Business <p> The word that would describe this professional year is deceptive , but for all the right reasons . After a massive push in the later months of 2014 when Mars , Venus , Mercury and the Sun all returned to your career sector , aligning with rebellious Pluto to get things moving , things peter off in the early weeks of the New Year . Mars left in December , but not before fuelling your professional passions and fighting spirit and not due to return until 2016 , the professional motivation that will take you through 2015 has already been banked . With Venus leaving your career sector on the 4th January and not returning until 2016 , she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional desires and expectations , making it important to trust your heart from the get go . With Mercury leaving on the 5th January and the Sun on the 20th January , while both will return in the later weeks of the year , with not even a New Moon here this year , things will have gone quiet within the first 3 weeks of the year . This is when things get deceptive , for while you 'll have gained more than enough momentum to keep your professional year charging along , it will appear that you 'd got a fairly lacklustre year on your hands . The reality is anything but lacklustre , for what you have is a year when the professional gods covering all things career related are stepping back and letting those covering work matters take the lead . Things will kick off when Venus makes a stealth visit to your work sector from the 19th July to the 1st August , retrograding back out just days after arriving . This gives you a chance to start looking at what you do and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . What you 're waiting for is the arrival of lucky Jupiter , whose return to your work sector on the 11th August will kick off your luckiest , most expansive and opportune year for work matters in over a decade , a year that wo n't run its course until September 2016 . The second half of the year is so peppered with support and opportunities , including a solar eclipse on the 13th September , Venus ' double dip visit from the 9th October to the 9 November and Mars ' visit from the 25th September to the 13th November , that once things start to move there 'll be no slowing things down . <h> Money <p> This is the year when you start to experience the benefits of having had Saturn in your financial sector since October 2012 and the financial challenges , demands and high benchmarks this set . With no opportunity to sweep financial matters under the carpet or avoid dealing with financial issues you 've been forced to confront things head on , which might have been challenging at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a completely revised financial situation , the reins firmly in your hands and the master of your own destiny . While Saturn will return to your financial sector from the 15th June to the 18th September it will be to take care of any housekeeping and retracing ground already covered , is n't going to bring any new challenges . Saturn only left your financial sector on Christmas Eve so you 're able to move into 2015 with a huge amount of financial resolve and conviction , knowing that you 've been through financial boot camp , but having graduated with a clear sense of how to retain control . While you ca n't afford to let things slide , the financial challenges of the past few years wo n't be repeated , but this is when you get to benefit from all that you 've learned , grown and achieved during that time . The Sun , Venus and Mercury will visit your financial sector this year , but it wo n't be until later in the year , in a period stretching from the Sun 's return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , which will be a fairly low key after the fact ' financial update and review . It will be decades before you 'll be tested as you have over the last few years or that you 've been in a better position to take your power back . It 's in the early part of the year that you 'll have a chance to make income matters a priority , this time without the challenge of having Saturn in opposition at the time . The most lucrative months of the year will run from Venus ' return to your income sector on the 18th March to the Sun 's departure on the 21st May . During that time the Sun , Venus , Mercury and even Mars will throw everything they have at breaking through any glass ceilings . Another fateful time for income matters will be around the time of the Full Moon in your income sector on the 28th October , by which point there will be some stunning developments unfolding on the work front . 4689 @qwx624689 4690 @qwx624690 <h> About Aries <p> Aries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you rush in where angels dare not tread .

Jupiter , planet of luck and expansion 's return to your career sector in August 2015 kicked off your biggest and most important professional year in over a decade , but it was the North Node 's return in November 2015 that turned this into something much more . This is the first time you 've moved into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in your career sector since 2004 , but it 's not only been 35 years since you 've had the North Node here as well , bringing the element of fate into play but it 's never happened while you 've had Pluto in your income sector . This is the year that Pluto , in your income sector since 2008 , has been waiting for , for after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mandate to promote income growth onto , Jupiter 's return to your career sector was a game changer . This is Pluto 's first and only visit to your income sector in our lifetime and while he returned 8 years ago , with Jupiter last in your career sector 12 years ago this is a once in a lifetime collaboration . The North Node , a force that is considered as , if not luckier than Jupiter , will spend every moment of 2016 in your career sector , ensuring that income and work forces continue to work together all year and right through to mid 2017 . Jupiter 's departure from your career sector on the 9th September may not even be felt , due to the momentum created by then and the ongoing partnership between income and career forces . By then you 'll have gained the kind of momentum that is easy to maintain , freeing Jupiter up to shift his focus and one of the main driving forces of the year onto social matters . This marks the start of not only the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , but the most important year in over a decade . Underpinning everything that transpires this year is the fact that Saturn will spend every moment of 2016 in Sagittarius , bringing you to your most powerful and important year in 3 decades , especially when it comes to taking your power back . After spending from December 2014 to June 2015 testing the waters , Saturn returned on the 18th September to begin a new 30 year Saturn cycle of growth and learning , spending until December 2017 helping you to take your power back , while laying down the foundations for this powerful new life chapter . <h> Love <p> While on paper the balance of power is on the romantic front this year , with Uranus not only spending all year in your romantic sector , as he 's done since returning in 2011 , but he 's experiencing his best conditions since arriving to electrify your love life . Under pressure from much of the past few years Uranus and romantic forces would have been happy just for a lack of roadblocks , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has allowed you to let the past go , just as major support from Saturn , who returned to your sign in September and will stay here until the end of 2017 , kicked in . Saturn and Uranus will be on good terms all year , with that building throughout the year but then peaking in the final months just as Venus , planet of love will be moving through your sign . That support will also peak during the most romantically charged months of the year , which is when the faster moving planets will move through your romantic sector . This begins with the Sun 's return on the 20th March and should run its course with Venus , planet of love 's departure on the 30th April . It should but it wo n't , due to the fact that Ceres , dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system , who is making her first visit to your romantic sector in 4 years , will decide she rather likes it here and instead of spending the just under 3 months she 'll normally spend here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over half the year . Ceres will return on the 15th April while Venus , planet of love is still here and while she 'll leave on the 17th July , she 'll return for a double dip visit on the 13th October , this time not leaving until February 2017 . It seems the love gods are making up for all you 've missed out on , in previous years . However , while Saturn is a major support for matters of the heart , this is going to put pressure on your relationships during your annual relationship review . The Sun will move through your relationship sector from the 21st May to the 21st June , throwing the solar spotlight on your relationships , with Venus here from the 24th May to the 18th June and Mercury from the 13th June to the 30th June . This is a short , sharp annual relationship review , with the focus on your relationships for just under 6 weeks , but as each planet moves through they 'll move into opposition with Saturn , who will create some real wakeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships will ultimately benefit from the wakeup calls this brings , allowing something more authentic to emerge . <h> Business <p> If a year could be rated on a 1 to 10 scale of how big a year this was for career and professional matters , then there is no doubt that 2016 is 10 and it 's something that is already underway before even stepping into the New Year . The professional tides began to turn for you when Jupiter returned to your career sector last August , bringing you to the start of your most expansive and potentially successful professional year in over a decade , though it may have come disguised as anything but . As well as returning at a time when the solar spotlight will always be on career matters anyway , but also when a series of oppositions may have brought work/life balance tensions to a head . It was only when Venus and Mars left your career sector in November that the professional momentum that should have waned in fact strengthened , while the North Node 's return on the 13th November has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career sector once every 12 years , raising the bar and demanding more from you , but also bringing the potential for growth , expansion and success , while the North Node returns once every 17 years to bring the element of fate into play . With the North Node spending the whole of 2017 in your career sector and not due to leave until May 2017 , teaming up with Jupiter for the first time here in 35 years you 've got some serious professional momentum going on . Turning retrograde on the 8th January but the North Node keeping the forward momentum going as you begin a review phase , career matters will take a back seat until Mercury returns on the 31st July , which is when the push begins to bring things home . Everything that has transpired since August 2015 and will transpire before those final hours in July are preparation for what comes next , with everything coming together between the 31st July and the 7th October . Yet Mercury , who will spend the early weeks of January in retrograde motion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23rd May in retrograde motion in your work sector , will also spend from the 31st August to the 22nd September in retrograde motion in your career sector and it 's during that phase , while the doors are open to second chances , that Jupiter will leave . August and September are the key months for everything that has been building on the career front since last August , with the period from the 6th August to the 30th August especially auspicious . While work matters get less attention this year , when they get a chance they 'll grab it with both hands . A short period starting on the 6th April and running through to the 13th June will house some stunning work developments . It 's while Mercury is in retrograde motion in your work sector , from the 29th April to the 23rd May that he wo n't just align with the Sun but literally cross in front it , creating a rare and fateful Mercury transit or eclipse on the 10th May . This is just 3 days after a New Moon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the doors are open to second chances and untapped potential . <h> Money <p> While the money gods will spend some time focused on money matters , it will be for a fairly contained period , starting with Venus ' return to your financial sector on the 18th June and ending with the Sun 's departure on the 22nd July . With Mars not visiting your financial sector this year and the Sun , Mercury and Venus moving close together , this is a short window of opportunity to take care of any financial housekeeping . There is no doubt that the money matters are the bridesmaid and income matters are the bride , but this makes it even more important to keep your money hat on while you can , taking care of money matters that need your attention , but also updating your financial expectations , working with Mercury 's smart head for money and generally getting your head in the game . In contrast Pluto , in your income sector from 2008 to 2024 , will have the focus on income matters 365 days a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 366 days this year . However , not all years are equal and Pluto and your income situation and matters have had some disastrous years in the past , but without a doubt 2016 is destined to be Pluto 's best year and therefore your best year in decades for income matters . This is less to do with Pluto 's ongoing campaign to promote income growth , change and evolution , for that carries on regardless and is everything to do with the balance between support and challenges . For most of Pluto 's time here the scales have been balanced the wrong way , with passing periods of professional support , outweighed by plenty of challenges . Yet everything that goes up must come down and what goes around comes around and if Pluto and your income situation and matters are long overdue a good year , then 2016 is set to deliver in spades . This comes from the fact that for the first time in 12 years you 'll move into the year with lucky Jupiter in your career sector , but also the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that 2016 is one of your biggest and best professional years in 35 years and the partnership already forged between career and income forces that makes this year so potentially lucrative . Yet in a year full of professional and income potential , there are some distinct periods that are potentially more lucrative and they will be during Venus ' two visits , the first from the 24th January to the 17th February and the next from the 12th November to the 8th December , but also during Mars ' first visit in 2 years . It 's when Mars and Pluto come together that glass goes flying as glass ceilings shatter . That will happen from the 27th September to the 9th November , giving you plenty of time to gain as much professional momentum as possible . 4689 @qwx624689 <p> Your birth chart represents a map of the solar system for the exact time and place of your birth , it 's a blueprint of your personality and represents a set of potentials , with the contents being added through the experiences of life .

@@73187149 @1887149/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> As is the case for all the Water signs this year , you 've reached a powerful and game changing year for income , work and career matters , with three of the most powerful planets in the social system coming together to create a triad of support between what is known as the triangle of success ' in your chart . Your income , work and career sectors are all at extremely positive aspects to each other and when you have a situation where you 've got planets in all three , then it is literally a case of all your bases being loaded and a triangle of support is created , known as the triangle of support . This will form temporarily from time to time , but with most planets moving fairly quickly it 's for a brief few days , if at all . What you have is a triangle of support in place for the first 6 months of the year and then to a lesser degree , on and off for the rest of the year . While any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the year the Sun , Venus and Mercury will visit all 12 areas of your chart and this year Mars will spend time in 10 areas , the main influences of the year itself is this triad of support . This is made of a partnership between lucky Jupiter , in your work sector until the 11th August , Saturn who returned to your career sector on Christmas Eve and Uranus , who has been in your income sector since 2010 , hoping and praying for the support that he finally has . After last year 's challenging financial conditions , income matters get a massive boost this year . While Jupiter will leave your work sector on the 11th August and Saturn will retrograde back out of your career sector between the 15th June and the 18th September , the faster moving planets will keep work matters going until November and once Saturn returns , he 's here until December 2017 . In short , you 've got your luckiest year in over a decade for work matters , your most powerful professional year in over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial challenges into income opportunities , with a triangle of success dominating much of the year . However , it 's in the second half of the year that your relationships will become a lot more important , especially once Jupiter returns to your relationship sector on the 11th August , where until leaving next September he 'll create your most important relationship year in over a decade . This is something that Venus is playing a big part in , so while this is the start of an auspicious year for both personal and professional relationship building , the planet of love will be keeping a special eye on your personal relationships . <h> Love <p> 2015 is a year that will come disguised as a very low key and ordinary year on both the romantic and relationship fronts , with very little happening in the early months of the year apart from Venus , planet of love 's visit to your sign from the 28th January to the 21st February . This is when you have a chance to define your romantic and relationship desires and expectations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some blind faith . With Jupiter having just wrapped up a yearlong visit to your romantic sector last July , knowing what you want from love will be as easy as looking back through the rear view mirror , with the past holding clues to what you do and do n't want from love . The first planetary activity in your romantic sector for the year will kick off when Venus moves through your romantic sector on the 8th May to the 6th June . This is weeks before the Sun , Mercury and Mars will move through , giving your heart the first say in what you want from love . The best months of the year for matters of the heart kick off with Venus ' return on the 8th May and run their course when Mars leaves on the 9th August . However , by then something special will be developing on the relationship front , kicking off with Venus ' return to your relationship sector on the 19th July . While Venus will only stay for 13 days before retrograding back out , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important relationship year in over a decade will be underway . This begins when lucky Jupiter returns to your relationship sector on the 11th August and with Mercury returning just 2 days earlier to ensure the communication lines are open and Mars having just left your romantic sector , with your romantic passions and fighting spirit engaged , this will create a dream start . The Sun , Mercury , Venus and Mars will all move through your relationship sector in Jupiter 's early weeks and in fact it wo n't be until the 13th November that he 's finally on his own . With Jupiter not leaving your relationship sector until the 10th September 2016 , this marks the start of your most important and defining relationship year in over a decade , however in order to build something real and authentic even the best of relationships will be put to the test . You might have luck on your side , but the love gods need you to invest all that you can as well . <h> Business <p> Exceptional , powerful , game changing , phenomenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come to mind when looking at the professional year that you 're moving into , for there is nothing to compare to what lies ahead of you . For the first time since 1988 you 're moving into the New Year with Saturn in your career sector , giving you the power to move mountains if you have to and for the first time since 2003 you 've got lucky Jupiter in your work sector , creating the kind of professional conditions and start to a new professional year that there is no precedent for , no guidebook or foot prints to follow and when you throw in support from Uranus in your income sector , this is a whole new ball game . While lucky Jupiter has been in your work sector since July and you had your normal professional update in the later months of 2014 , when even Mars moved through your career sector , it was Saturn 's return on Christmas Eve , just 8 days before moving into the New Year that was the real game changer . This is something that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 days after the Sun left and your annual professional update ran its course this was a natural progression , though nothing can prepare you for the step up this has created . Saturn will take a break for a few months midyear , retrograding back out on the 15th June , but when he returns on the 18th September he 's here for the long haul , not leaving until December 2017 . As you move into the New Year you 're literally in the early days of the landmark years of your professional life , years that will represent the pinnacle of everything you 've been working towards until now and will provide the foundation that everything from now , for the next 3 decades , will grow on from . While Jupiter will leave your work sector in August and wo n't be here when Saturn returns , he 'll caste an auspicious shadow over the whole year . It 's during the 3 months that Saturn is gone from your career sector that lucky Jupiter will have a chance to bring things home on the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Venus ' return to your work sector on the 6th June to the end of her second and double dip visit on the 9th October , the professional gods will throw everything they have at making Jupiter 's final months count and to extract every possible advantage . There 'll be a chance in the last 6 weeks of the year to bring the focus back onto career matters but between Jupiter and Saturn and their auxiliary support crews , there is n't a moment of 2015 that you do n't have some phenomenal professional forces in play . Throw away the game book you 've carried with you during previous years , for this is the year that everything changes and is without a doubt both your biggest professional year in decades and a gateway year into a powerful new professional era . It helps that the money gods are also smiling on you . <h> Money <p> While some of the core forces on the income and financial fronts are still there , those that created so much financial tension from November 2013 to October 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in your financial sector from December 2013 to July 2014 , the 9 months Ceres spent here , from November 2013 to August 2014 and then the annual financial update that came just afterwards , that brought a lot of financial tension and a bit of a roller coaster ride . However , you 're already enjoying the benefits of what this created . With Uranus , in your income sector until 2019 , the only planet in either of your money houses for the whole year , the lunar nodes will work to keep the balance even between money coming in and money going out , right through until the South Node leaves your income sector and the North Node leaves your financial sector on the 12th December . It 's because the lunar nodes are located in your two money houses that there 'll be eclipses here this year , the first a total lunar eclipse in your financial sector on the 5th April and then another lunar eclipse on the 28th September , this time in your income sector . That the lunar eclipse in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year for income matters and the lunar eclipse in your income sector will fall at the most active point of the year for financial matters and could turn into opportunities for income and financial matters as they come to a head , turning and/or tipping point . However , in terms of where the power lies this year , it 's on the income front and not just because Uranus will spend the whole of 2015 in your income sector . What makes this such a good year for Uranus and income matters is lucky Jupiter 's position in your work sector until the 11th August and Saturn 's position in your career sector for the majority of the year . The most lucrative months for income matters and opportunities will come when the Sun , Venus , Mercury and Mars move through your income sector , with this period kicking off with Mars ' return to your income sector on the 20th February and ending with the Sun 's departure 2 months to the day later , on the 20th April .

@@73187151 @1887151/ <h> 2016 Overview <p> If you look at Jupiter and Saturn , the two planets that create the major trust for any year , then 2016 is a big year for money matters , travel , adventure and learning and also for personal and professional networking , in many cases at the same time . It was Jupiter 's return to your financial sector in August 2015 that supposedly kicked off your luckiest year for money matters in over a decade . I say supposedly for at the time it may have felt like anything but good luck , though any financial tension and challenges this created began easing back last November . Jupiter visits your financial sector every 12 years and was last here from mid 2003 to mid 2014 . The problem this time around is that Jupiter returned to not only find Neptune and Chiron in your income sector , but entrenched here for several years and remaining here for several more years , they have become used to getting the money gods ' full attention . When Jupiter came along and put the focus onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of oppositions between August and November 2015 stirring things up on both fronts . However , peace was restored when the lunar nodes returned to your two money houses in November , with the North Node spending the whole of 2016 in your financial sector and the South Node the whole of 2016 in your income sector , policing a balance between money coming in and money going out . So long as you work with them to maintain that balance , then 2016 is set to be a lucrative and promising year for both financial and income matters . Both sides are well supported , with money matters being supported by Pluto , who is working to put a more positive spin on money matters , but also allowing you to think outside the square and to really change your attitudes and perceptions . Income forces will come into their own in the early months of the year , then will keep ticking over all year , receiving some special support from Mars , who will spend an extraordinary amount of time in your career sector this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to fuel your professional passions , fighting and competitive spirit and then move on , he will return on the 4th January and leave on the 6th March , but will then return for a double dip visit from the 28th May to the 3rd August . What makes both visits auspicious is that the first visit will fall during the most lucrative weeks of the year for income matters and the second during the best weeks of the year for work matters . While Saturn will spend the whole of 2016 in your sector of friendship , teamwork and networking , making this a big year for personal and professional networking , Jupiter will only stay in your financial sector until the 9th September . This is the point where Jupiter not only returns to your sector of adventure , travel , learning and discovery , but a huge amount of support in his early weeks will see the year erupt into something a lot more exciting , something that will stay with you right through to October 2017 . <h> Love <p> After the massive relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things settle this year , but with a massive 15 month push having just run its course in October 2015 , you 'll move into the New Year with a clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you and more than enough momentum . It was the 13 months Jupiter spent in your relationship sector from July 2014 to August 2015 and the nearly 4 months that Venus , planet of love spent here from June to October 2015 that has laid down the foundations for the course your relationships will continue to take . This year the relationship gods will put very little focus on your relationships and even by normal standards it 's on the low side , having given all that they could last year they know that all your relationships need is an annual update . That will begin with Venus ' return to your relationship sector on the 12th July , where unlike her 4 month visit last year she 'll move through in just a few weeks , leaving on the 6th August . With Mercury moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun from the 22nd July to the 23rd August , this will see the relationship gods active for just 6 weeks to the day , in stark contrast to the 15 months of activity that wrapped up last October . This is a short relationship update , with a chance to take care of any relationship housekeeping and to update a sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you . Your relationships will also get a voice during a Full Moon here on the 24th January , halfway between your last annual relationship review and the next . What will keep your relationships moving forward authentically is having the communication lines open , which you have support for all year . Without so much focus on your relationships this year this gives romantic forces more of a fair deal , which they 'll take advantage of . Venus will visit your sign twice this year , first from the 17th February to the 12th March and again from the 8th December , where the planet of love will see in the New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your romantic sector on the 14th December , with the love gods delivering an early Christmas gift in the later weeks of the year . You wo n't have to wait that long with the Sun , Mercury and Venus all getting together to make the period from the 21st May to the 30th June some of the most romantically charged weeks of the year . Like the relationship forces this year this is only a short window of opportunity , making them all the more important . <h> Business <p> Saturn 's departure from your career sector last September brought you to the end of a nearly 3 year professional boot camp , one that is likely to have been professionally challenging , but at the same time has laid down the foundations for all future professional potential and growth for years , if not decades to come . Normally , with no more major planetary activity in either your work or career sectors and the Sun , Mercury and Venus moving through each year but just for a few weeks and Mars , if he does show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should see things quieten down considerably , with a chance to let things play out . However , while that will be the case on the work front , on the career front it seems that while the hard work has been invested , that the professional gods are n't ready to walk away , wanting to extract as many opportunities and potential as possible . The Sun will always move through your career sector in September/October and while in 2015 Venus was late arriving and late leaving , having only just left on the 30th December , this should have brought all planetary activity to an end , giving you a good start to the year but leaving you on your own . It 's Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos that will not only keep things active , but fire up things on both the work and career fronts for much of the first 9 months of the year , no mean feat for a planet that usually moves through in just 6 weeks . Visiting your career sector every other year , as well as fuelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunts down opportunities , making these some of the most potentially successful professional weeks in a 2 year period and returning on the 4th January , now that you 've graduated from professional boot camp he 's keen to use this to your advantage . While Mars will leave on the 6th March , this will put him here during the most lucrative months of 2016 , creating the potential to do well professionally and financially during that period . However , this is n't the last you 'll see of Mars , returning from the 28th May to the 3rd August for a double dip visit , spending just under 19 weeks here , spread out over two visits . It 's the timing of Mars ' return that turns your annual update on the work front into the potential for so much more . Mars wo n't visit your work sector in 2016 , with the period from Venus ' return on the 18th June to the Sun 's departure on the 22nd July a small window of opportunity for the professional gods to get in and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars returning to your career sector from the 28th May to the 3rd August he 'll be here throughout that time , creating some especially auspicious weeks for both work and career matters . Mars will leave your career sector on the 3rd August , but with Venus returning on the 24th September to begin 2016 's annual update , something that wo n't run its course until the 22nd November , a year that should be a downsized version of previous years is holding its own , with the professional gods active for much of the year . <h> Money <p> Last year saw financial tension running high , especially in the 3 month period from early August to early November . On one level this was to be expected and to a certain degree , though not to the same extreme you 'll experience this again this year , but it 's the nature of that tension that masks a golden opportunity on both the financial and income fronts . With Chiron in your income sector from 2011 to 2019 and Neptune from 2012 to 2026 there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there will be for another 10 years . Income forces are feeling pretty pleased with themselves , especially with the support from Saturn during the 3 years he spent in your career sector from October 2012 to September 2015 and from Jupiter in your work sector , from July 2013 to July 2014 , so you can imagine they were n't pleased by an upsurge in financial focus when Jupiter returned to your financial sector last August . Over the course of that 3 month period the Sun , Mercury , Venus , Jupiter and Mars , making his first visit to your financial sector in 2 years and last until 2017 all moved into opposition , creating a series of 10 oppositions between income and financial forces . It was just days of the last opposition played out that the North Node returned to your financial sector and the South Node to your income sector for the first time in 17 years , to police a balance between income and financial forces .

@@73187152 @1887152/ <h> 2016 Overview <p> The planets that have the biggest influence on any given year are Jupiter and Saturn , the planets that belong in their own group , one that is strong enough to influence the year as a whole , but not to the degree that it becomes the wallpaper to your life . What has become the wallpaper of your life is a battle to find and maintain a balance between work and play , with powerful and long term planets on both fronts here for so long and set to stay around for so many more years to come , that this is now the norm . You may have even forgot that the battle is being waged , so much has this become the normal backdrop to your life . On the other extreme , with the Sun traveling through all 12 areas of your chart in 12 months and Venus and Mercury moving with him , the year has an annual pattern that will play out year after year . Where Jupiter and Saturn sit is in their own lane , here long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that they become the wallpaper of your life , so it 's to them that we look to for the makeup of 2016 . For Saturn it 's cut and dry , for having returned to your income sector in September 2015 and not due to leave until December 2017 , he 'll spend the whole year focused on smashing through glass ceilings , especially those in your own mind . This makes 2016 a powerful year for income developments , but also for raising the bar on your expectations across all currencies in your life . Saturn and income forces will work closely with Uranus in your work sector all year , but it 's when career developments take shape in July/August that you 'll reach an exceptional point of the year for income , work and career matters . Jupiter on the other hand shifts focus in September and it 's an extreme shift , changing the dynamics of the year . Until the 9th September Jupiter is working to create some of the best and most important months in decades for friendship and relationship building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in partnership with others . What makes the 9th September such a significant shift is that this is when Jupiter begins the year long wind down of a 12 year Jupiter cycle that began in 2005 , preparing for his return to your sign next October and the start of a new Jupiter cycle of expansion . In the meantime , Mars elevates himself into a major player category , spending the first 9 months of the year moving backwards and forwards between your sign and your income sector , turning what is usually a 6 week Mars return into a nearly 9 month event , while spending a lot of time working with Saturn to push through those glass ceilings . <h> Love <p> On paper this should n't be a significant year for relationship matters and with Neptune in your romantic sector from 2012 to 2026 , just another year as far as romantic matters are concerned , but it 's anything but the case on both fronts , for different reasons . This will be Neptune 's fourth full year in your romantic sector so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasies he 's fuelling , but the difference this year is that he 's being challenged , by the fact that for the first time ever he 's being confronted by Jupiter , over on the other side of the sky , who is wearing none of your excuses . Yet while at times this may present as romantic challenges or pressure it 's that after so much support for so many years , the love gods are no longer buying your excuses . As always the most romantically charged months of any year will February/March , when the Sun moves through . With the Sun in your romantic sector from the 19th February to the 20th March , Mercury from the 5th March to the 22nd March and Venus , planet of love from the 12th March to the 6th April , this is both when the love gods will be most active , but also when your excuses are more likely to be challenged . However , the Sun wo n't be the first to arrive , with Ceres moving through from the 19th January to the 15th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first visit in 4 years and last for another 4 years , here to get to the heart of a your true romantic needs and priorities . It 's Ceres ' return to your relationship sector on the 17th July that will see her do the same here , with a visit that spans until the 13th October giving you a chance to get right to the heart of what you really want and need from your relationships . This begins after the relationship gods put your relationships through a fairly vigorous annual review , starting on the 6th April and concluding on the 13th June . It 's during that time that Mercury will not only turn retrograde , but in retrograde motion we will experience a rare Mercury transit , or Mercury eclipse , something that brings the truth to the surface . Just before Ceres begins to create some magical relationship months , a short relationship boot camp will leave you with a clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you . <h> Business <p> Compared to last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at the same time this is when you 're likely to enjoy the benefits of what has been triggered over recent years , with the money and professional gods working together to create what should be a good year for income , work and career matters . What is going to make any period of planetary activity in either the work or career fronts more opportune is the fact that Saturn is spending the whole of 2016 in your income sector and spending 20 weeks here spread out over two visits , the first from the 6th March to the 28th May and again from the 3rd August to the 27th September . While the whole year is a powerful one for income matters , it 's while Mars is here that there is a very real chance to break through some glass ceilings and it just so happens that there 's a lot happening on the work and career fronts during his two visits . With Uranus in your work sector from 2011 to 2019 things will always be ticking over on the work front , though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work pressure and between February 2014 and November 2015 the South Node was here , making it hard to move on or to escape the hold past challenges have had on you . Having turned direct in the closing days of December and Venus having returned to your income sector just days later , the early weeks of 2016 will see work matters slowly gain their feet , during some very lucrative conditions on the income front . The most active weeks on the work front kick off when the Sun , Mercury and Venus move through and this year this begins with the Sun 's return on the 20th March and runs its course with Venus ' departure on the 30th April . It 's because this is just a short 6 week window of opportunity that the professional gods will be working to gain as much traction as possible . With Mars returning to your income sector on the 6th March and not leaving until the 28th May , this will play out against the backdrop of some of the most powerful income conditions in decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short period of opportunity on the career front as well , beginning with Mercury 's return to your career sector on the 14th July and ending with the Sun 's departure on the 23rd August , with Mars returning to your income sector on the 3rd August , this will once again see income matters roar back to life just as things pick up professionally . It 's the New Moon here on the 3rd August that is especially auspicious , creating an opportunity for new opportunities and beginnings on the very day that Mars returns for his double dip visit to your income sector . Another auspicious day to look out for , factoring in a few days either side , is a Full Moon in your career sector on the 24th January . Falling during Uranus ' first full month in direct motion in your work sector , while Venus is making a belated visit to your income sector and as the Full Moon since lucky Jupiter left in August 2015 , this could bring income , work and career matters to a head , turning and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd August . <h> Money <p> Even though Saturn returned to your income sector in December 2014 , elevating income matters from something that was supported at specific points of the year to something that would shape the year itself , the die was n't really caste until the Sun and Mercury returned in late November 2015 . Even then , with both gone by Christmas it was only in the closing hours of 2015 that the real magic was revealed . Yes this is the second year in a row that you 've moved into the New Year with Saturn in your income sector , but just the second year in 3 decades and with a wealth of experience under your belt this was always going to be the year for breaking some major glass ceilings . However , the money gods have employed two secret weapons and they 're set to turn this into one of the most powerful income years on record . Those secret weapons are Venus , who was so late in returning last year that she missed out by less than 48 hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll move into the New Year with the planet of money , desire and attraction on board . Here until the 24th January , she 'll spend the early weeks of 2016 fuelling your desires , expectations and a sense of entitlement and triggering the laws of attraction , in a year that Saturn was always going to make this one of the most powerful income years in decades . Venus will return from the 18th October to the 12th November , making two visits in 2016 to make up for the lack of time she spent here in 2015 . However , it 's the second secret weapon that is the most explosive with Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos returning to meet up with Saturn here for the first time in 28 years . Normally moving through your income sector in just 6 weeks every other year and always coming with a warrior spirit and a sledgehammer in his hand , Mars ' return on the 6th March signals the start of when things really start to happen .

@@73187153 @1887153/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> For most of us 2015 is destined to be a year of two halves , split down the middle when on the 11th August , Jupiter planet of luck and expansion changes signs and therefore the direction and energy that the year itself takes , but for you that line in the sand is so extreme that it could be game changing . For as you move into the New Year you are literally in the final months of a Jupiter cycle that began when Jupiter last returned to Virgo in August 2003 . Back then Jupiter spent a year in your sign , laying down the foundations for a 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion , a cycle that as you move into 2015 is now in its final leg . Since Jupiter returned to Leo in July 2014 and began the process of bringing this cycle home , closing old doors and finishing things up , you 've spent a lot of time looking back , making sense of the journey you 've been on since August 2003 , but late last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9th April . This means that while you 're moving into a new year , instead of looking to the future you 're looking to the past and the more you try and look to the future , all you 're likely to see is fog . This could be disconcerting , for is it the fog of war or that you do n't have a future ? Neither could be further from the truth , for once Jupiter turns direct your focus will shift to the future and the line up will begin for Jupiter 's return to your sign on the 11th August . Venus , who normally moves through your sign in just 24 days , will return on the 19th July but realising what 's about to happen , will retrograde back out on the 1st August , ready to return once Jupiter gets here . For when Jupiter returns to your sign on the 11th August that 's when your most important , expansive and opportune year will kick off and until leaving next September , he 'll be here to help you plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're moving into , one that will take you through to 2027 . Underpinning everything else will be the fact that you 've moved into the most important year in 3 decades for home and family matters , with a need to look back to the period from 1985 to 1988 to find a reference point . Apart from the 3 months from the 15th June to the 18th September Saturn , who returned to your home and family sector on Christmas Eve , will spend until December 2017 building some powerful new structures and foundations on the home front . Home and family matters are likely to be your biggest challenge in 2015 , but if you take responsibility , accept the challenge and keep things real , you 've got the ability to build something strong and enduring , something that will define your home and family life for decades to come <h> Love <p> In many ways 2015 is a continuation of 2014 , with the same forces controlling things on the romantic and relationship fronts still controlling things this year , with things very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2008 to 2024 and Neptune not only in your relationship sector until 2026 but custodian for a journey that began in 2003 , there wo n't be a moment of 2015 where the love gods are n't focused on both matters of the heart and your relationships . However , there will be times of the year when there is more focus than others and also when the dynamics shift , with some healthy competition in play during the early weeks of the year . You will always move into the New Year with the Sun in your romantic sector , where he 'll always spend the first 3 weeks and with Venus and Mercury always close by , this is a chance to make matters of the heart a priority , before the focus shifts to your relationships , something that usually happens in late February onwards . Last year romantic matters got a major push in the final months of 2014 and especially when Mars moved through , with his departure in early December leaving you with your romantic passions and fighting spirit engaged . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then not returning until early 2016 and Mercury leaving on the 5th January , not to return until later in the year , it 's the early days of the year that are the most romantically focused , with a need to start the year in the way you intend to go on . It 's while the Sun is still in your romantic sector that Mars will return to your relationship sector on the 13th January and with Venus returning on the 28th January , it wo n't be long till the main focus shifts to your relationships . You almost need to bottle the romantic sentiment that is there in abundance in the early days of the year . To start with your relationships will get nothing but support , but Jupiter 's return to your sign on the 11th August , to begin your most personally empowered year in over a decade , will put your relationships on notice . <h> Business <p> While none of the planetary activity in your work and career sector will remain in play all year , which means that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , both areas have enough support to ensure that you not only have a good professional year , but one that is likely to be fairly lucrative . You 'll move into the New Year with Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos in your work sector and having returned in early December , for the first time since 1999 , he 's spent Christmas here , not only giving you no chance to take your work hat off over the holiday period but creating a situation where one professional year has blurred into the next . Usually it 's the Sun 's return to your work sector on the 20th January that will get things moving for the year , providing a clear line in the sand between one professional year and the next , but not this year . This means that you 'll move into 2015 with your drives , passions , fighting and competitive spirit engaged and having already been here for nearly 4 weeks and due to leave on the 13th January , there 'll be a sense of urgency and impatience as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th January , Mercury on the 5th January and the Sun on the 20th January , you 'll have the backup needed to continue what Mars started . While the main push to get work matters up to speed will be over by the end of January , you 'll have until Mercury eventually leaves on the 31st March to keep your head in the game and take the practical steps needed to continue what began in the early weeks of the year . While this will be it for the main planetary activity in your work sector Ceres , dwarf planet and goddess of the solar system will make two visits this year , the first from the 4th April to the 4th August and then again from the 28th October to the 29th January 2016 . This is an undercover mission , giving you a chance to take a deeper look at your priorities , in terms of job satisfaction and a sense of purpose . While the first 3 months of the year are the most important for work matters , career matters will get their turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , starting with Venus ' return on the 12th April and ending with Mars ' departure on the 25th June . This is when you 're more likely to attract new career opportunities , experience success and in general feel most competitive . Above and beyond this there is a lucrative strand running through the year that could bring unexpected income opportunities . <h> Money <p> After the very real financial tensions and roller coaster ride of the last 2 years , what you really want and need is some stability and that 's just what you 've got this year , as well as a chance to benefit from all that you 've been through . It was the 8 months that Mars spent in your income sector from December 2013 to July 2014 that created both financial tension and a chance to either smash through or inflict some serious damage on any glass ceilings , especially those in your own mind . The majority of all the planetary oppositions of 2014 played out between Uranus in your financial sector and the planets moving through your income sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrograded backwards and forwards over the same ground , this created a lot of tension . Yet in the process this laid down the foundations and left the income potential that you 're now able to benefit from . This year , with the South Node in your financial sector and the North Node in your income sector until the 12th November , the money gods are still very focused on balance , but so long as the balance between money coming in and money going out is maintained and you achieve an equilibrium that works for you , this is a year where you 're likely to achieve surprising opportunities on both fronts , mainly because of what has already been invested . Because the lunar nodes trigger eclipses , which in turn trigger opportunities , this is where some of this year 's biggest eclipses will fall , including a total lunar eclipse in your financial sector on the 28th September and a total lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 5th April . Both eclipses will fall during the most active points of the year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both with the power to bring income and financial matters to a head , turning and/or tipping point . What I mean by this is that the lunar eclipse in your income sector on the 5th April , right in the heart of the most active months of the year for financial matters , will run from the 21st February to the 20th April . At the same time the lunar eclipse in your financial sector on the 28th will fall right in the heart of the most active and potentially lucrative point of the year for income matters , which will run from the 28th August 2015 to the 4th January 2016. 4689 @qwx624689 4691 @qwx624691 <h> About Virgo <p> As a Virgo , you are good at organizing stuff .

It was on Christmas Eve that Saturn left your career sector , where he had been since October 2012 , not only forcing you to keep your professional hat on but dealing with life 's challenges head on . As well as spending the last few years in your career sector , this has put Saturn at a challenging aspect , though in a surprisingly positive way . When a planet moves into opposition there is a lot of pressure and tension , but Saturn was n't in that aspect , rather one where he 's been pushing you in a constructive way . Whether it was on the professional front or in other areas of your life , this has been a competitive energy focused on forcing you to believe in yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever felt inclined to scale Mt Everest , then you 'd want to have Saturn in your career sector , giving you a Herculean sense of determination . However , life ca n't be spent living in that energy 24/7 , though that has been your reality since 2012 , hence why a really good rest over the holiday period is just what the doctor has ordered . This is something that you 'll continue to benefit from , either professionally or with other challenges you 've faced over recent years and in the early months of the year and especially from the 13th January onwards , you can expect to see things move on the income front as a result . This year we have a triad of energy in play between Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus and for you this is playing out in what is known as the social triad , with lucky Jupiter in your relationship sector , Saturn in your friendship sector and Uranus in your communication sector . Where over the past few years you 've been climbing your own mountain , this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship and relationship building and connecting with others . To start with there could be some relationship challenges , making it seem that this is anything but a lucky and expansive relationship year , but it 's simply that as the planets move through your sign they are advocating for your own needs and in the process are testing your relationships . This is as much a chance to raise the bar on the relationship front , when there is so much support available , as it is to ensure you have the right balance between your own and your relationship needs . It 's in the second half of the year that the money gods will come into their own , apart from the early months of the year which are likely to be the most lucrative for income opportunities .

Since Jupiter returned your relationships have n't really been put to the test , but that will change when , in the early days of the New Year Mars , moving through your sign , will move into opposition with Jupiter . Being met at the door of the New Year with personal and/or relationship tensions could cause you to think you 've got a challenging relationship year on your hands , but the very reverse is true .

With Jupiter in retrograde motion until the 9th April , the early months of the year are a chance to take care of any housekeeping with Venus , Mars , Mercury and the Sun all moving through your relationship sector between the 6th June and the 9th October , to help put your relationships on the course you want them to continue on .

The last time you moved into the New Year with no planetary activity in either of your professional houses and without a need to have your professional hat on from the get go was in 2012 and between then and the start of 2015 you 've been through more than you have in decades .

What you have in the early months of the year is a chance to let things settle and to start reaping the benefits of all that you 've invested . Saturn has n't quite finished with you and will return for a short recap from the 15th June to the 18th September , retrograding back into your career sector in order to tie up loose ends , ensure you 've covered all your bases and there is no stone left unturned . The timing of this is significant for it 's the Sun , Venus , Mercury and Mars ' first visit to your work sector since lucky Jupiter left that is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jupiter more focused on positioning you for success and then waiting for the right conditions to come into play .

The most opportune months of the year for work matters , especially in terms of tapping into and exploiting what lucky Jupiter has set the scene for , will be during the period beginning with Venus ' return to your career sector on the 8th May and will run until Mars leaves on the 9th August , with the final 6 weeks likely to be the most success laden . With Saturn retrograding back into your career sector from the 15th June to the 18th September he 'll be here during much of that time , giving you the power to move mountains if you have to and a chance to finally bring work and career matters together and everything you 've been working towards over the last 3 years .

Normal for you is having continuous planetary activity in your income sector , which you have had since 2003 and will continue to have until Neptune leaves in 2026 and your financial sector , which is focused more on money matters as a whole , not active until the second half of each year . This will be the norm and you 'll reach the midpoint of 2015 and find that nothing has changed . The only difference of any note in the first half of the year is that Mars , who last visited your income sector in 2013 , will make a visit and in fact his return on the 13th January will kick things off early in the year , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's during Mars ' visit , from the 13th January to the 20th February that income matters will gain some real traction and with Venus returning on the 28th January , the Sun on the 19th February and Mercury on the 13th March , what Mars kicks off just 2 weeks into the New Year will take until the 31st March to play out .

For with Saturn having returned to your work and health sector for the first time since 1988 you 're going to be called on to do more , accomplish more and work harder than you 've ever worked before , at the same time that the hard task master of the cosmos will be watching for any sign that you 're burning the candle at both ends , failing to look after yourself or you 're running on overdraft .

From the get go choose to take a healthy approach to looking after yourself , but also a smart approach to time management , learning from the work/life balance lessons of the past . For the reality is that there is a huge opportunity for success this year , especially with Saturn well supported by lucky Jupiter in your income sector until August and from Uranus , who will once again spend the whole year in your career sector . In fact , the partnership between income , work and career is so strong , especially in the first half of the year , that 2015 has the potential to be your most successful and lucrative professional year ever . This is all the more reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Saturn will retrograde back into a fun , playful , romantic and creatively charged part of your chart from the 15th June to the 18th September , in an effort to make sure life does n't become all work and no play . In the meantime , you have a less dramatic but potentially very good year for relationship building , especially with Ceres spending 26 weeks of the year in your relationship sector and lucky Jupiter returning to your communication sector on the 11th August . <h> Love <p> For the first time in 3 years you 're moving into the New Year with no planetary activity in your romantic sector , thanks to Saturn 's departure on Christmas Eve , wrapping up a journey that began in 2012 . While Saturn is the hard task master of the cosmos and he can create challenges , he 's spent the majority of the last 3 years giving your heart a sense of resolve and putting responsibility for matters of the heart in your hands .

Saturn will return from the 15th June to the 18th September to check on how you 're doing and it 's during that time that the doors will be open to the past . Venus will move through your sign from the 8th May to the 6th June so will just miss Saturn , but she 'll leave you with a clear sense of what you want from love and what you need to be willing to commit to . Apart from that and a Full Moon in your romantic sector on the 4th May , you 'll have to wait until the Sun returns to your romantic sector on the 24th October to make matters of the heart and the spirit of romance a priority .

The planet that will spend very little time in your relationship sector this year is Venus , planet of love . Once Venus leaves on the 4th January she wo n't return until early 2016 , allowing you to move into the New Year with a clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you , but then forcing you to hold onto that . Your relationships will get a major boost when lucky Jupiter returns to your communication sector in August , along with a huge amount of cosmic support . <h> Business <p> You are moving into this professional year with such a unique combination of forces and support that you have to throw away the guide book or the attitudes that tell you what to expect , for you 're moving into a year unlike one you 've experienced . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky Jupiter in your income sector and for the first time since 1988 Saturn in your work sector , where along with Uranus in your career sector they 're creating a triad of support that will dominate at least the first 7 months of 2015 . Saturn only returned to your work sector on Christmas Eve , for the first time in 27 years , though returning just 2 days after last year 's most active months on the work front ran their course , this was a natural , though major progression . Had Saturn not returned you 'd be moving into the New Year with no planetary activity in your work sector and it would have stayed that way until late December . Instead you 've reached your most powerful and important year for work matters in 3 decades , coincidently as you 're also moving into one of your luckiest for income matters and at a time that Uranus has been working since 2010 to create the right professional environment . You 'll also move into the New Year with Ceres in your work sector , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 9th January offering a rare opportunity to redefine your priorities , especially in terms of job satisfaction and a sense of purpose . This is Ceres ' first visit since 2010 and the timing could n't be better and with Mars having visited late last year your drives , passions , fighting and competitive spirit are already engaged and you 're ready to work with Saturn to really drive things forward on the work front . Saturn will retrograde back out from the 15th June to the 18th September , giving you a chance to let things settle , but once he returns he 'll stay until December 2017 , making this the most powerful and important year for work matters in 3 decades , but the start of a major chapter that will define the next 3 years .

This is the first time you 've moved into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in your income sector and in retrograde motion any financial tension will ensure you 're not asleep at the wheel . This is also a chance to address financial and money matters , for with Mars leaving your financial sector on the 13th January Venus , Mercury and the Sun all returning in January , also all gone by the end of February and none returning again this year , the time to take care of any financial housekeeping is in the first 2 months of the year .

@@73187160 @1887160/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> Let 's face it , there are times when the years do really blend in together , but if you were to look back in your past there would be stand out years , years where you only have to see or hear the name of that year and you know exactly what was happening in your life , whether it was for good or bad reasons or a combination of the two . While 2015 will come unannounced as one of those years , this is exactly what it is and to know before you move into the year that it is , gives you a chance to approach the year with a certain sense of reverence , knowing that as a landmark year in your life it requires anything but a flippant approach . What makes this such a game changing year is an event that happened on Christmas Eve , which was Saturn 's return to your sign . This brings you to the start of a new 30 year cycle of growth and learning and while yes , that is code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final days of 2014 was the process of taking your power back . Saturn is the hard task master of the cosmos , the planet that gives us our strength , endurance and sense of determination , but he also asks that you show up in your own life , take responsibility and do things the right way , even if it is the hard way . Saturn returned on Christmas Eve for what is a 3 year visit , one that wo n't run its course until December 2017 , so is a slow and gradual process . Saturn will retrograde back out from the 15th June to the 18th September , so unless you 're an early born Sagittarian , either born in November or the very early days of December , then it will be later this year or even into 2016 before he aligns with your Sun and the really hard demands are made on you . Yet from the moment Saturn returned a new 30 year Saturn cycle began and with that a need to look to the future rather than the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retrogrades back out from the 15th June to the 18th September . What is going to make the foundation year of this new Saturn cycle so positive and empowering is the support that Saturn has , mainly from Uranus in your romantic and creative sector and from lucky Jupiter , in your sector of travel , adventure , learning and discovery until the 11th August . This is the perfect energy to see this Saturn cycle for what it is , the start of a new journey . What you 're able to do this year is lay down the foundations that your future will be built on , with a chance to lay some really strong and enduring footings . While a sense of adventure will prevail long after Jupiter leaves your sector of travel , adventure , learning and discovery , it 's from midyear that things become more professionally focused , with Jupiter 's return to your career sector on the 11th August kicking off your luckiest and most expansive professional year in over a decade . It seems that the money gods are smiling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . <h> Love <p> While a romantic theme will run throughout the year with Uranus , planet of surprise , synchronicity and the unexpected keeping the laws of synchronicity in play until he leaves your romantic sector in 2019 , there will be times when things heat up and especially when Venus , planet of love gets involved . This year things will get off to an early start when Mars returns to your romantic sector on the 20th February , with his first visit in 2 years due to fire up your romantic passions and fighting spirit , as well as giving you the courage and confidence to work with the laws of synchronicity . With Venus , planet of love not only returning the next day , her visit from the 21st February to the 18th March will not only kick off the most romantically charged weeks of the year , but weeks where the laws of attraction and synchronicity will be in play at the same time . From Mars ' return on the 20th February to the Sun 's departure on the 20th April lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a year when things will never really go completely off the boil . It 's during a total lunar eclipse on the 28th September that the love gods will have a chance to bring things to a major turning or tipping point . Venus will spend surprisingly little time in your sign this year , having already left by the time you move into 2015 and not returning until the 30th December , spending less than 48 hours here this year and all at the very end , making it important to hold onto the romantic and relationship desires and expectations you move into the year with . While the love gods will ensure matters of the heart remain a priority all year and not just from the 20th February to the 20th April , your relationships will get a lot less attention . The time to focus on and to invest in your relationship is from Venus ' return to your relationship sector on the 12th April to Mercury 's departure on the 9th July . Mercury will retrograde here this year , turning what is usually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st May to the 9th July , giving you a lot of time and resources to ensure the communication lines are open . <h> Business <p> 2015 is a year that will sneak up on you in terms of what a game changing professional year this is destined to become , despite the fact that things will not start out looking very ordinary , but as is usually the case in the early months of the year it 's going to look like there is not a lot going on . As you move into the New Year there is no planetary activity in either of your professional houses and that 's been your reality for several years , with April/May usually the most active months of any year for work matters and August/September for career matters . The only thing out of the ordinary in the first half of the year is that instead of waiting until April for new doors to open on the work front they 'll open in March , when on the 18th March Venus returns to trigger the laws of attraction and engage your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all move through , creating a very busy , hectic and dynamic time for work matters , beginning with Venus ' return on the 18th March and running through to the Sun 's departure on the 21st May . Apart from the fact that Mars ' visit from the 1st April to the 12th May will be the warrior planet of the cosmos ' first visit to your work sector since 2013 , there is still nothing out of the ordinary in the developments on the work front during that time , despite the fact that these will be the best months of the year for work matters . It 's on the career front that the professional gods have something special and game changing planned , though to start with this may start out fairly low key . Things start to move when Venus returns to your career sector on the 19th July , where she 'll fuel your professional desires and expectations , attract opportunities and attention your way , but less than 2 weeks later she 'll retrograde back out on the 1st August , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrogrades back out and just 3 days after Mercury 's return on the 8th August that everything changes , with lucky Jupiter 's return to your career sector on the 11th August kicking off your luckiest , most important , expansive and opportune professional year in over a decade , a year that wo n't run its course until September 2016 . It 's during Jupiter 's early months that career matters will get a massive boost , not only from Venus ' double dip visit from the 9th October to the 9th November and Mars ' visit from the 25th September to the 13th November , aimed at fuelling your professional passions and fighting spirit , but from a solar eclipse on the 13th September , with the potential to open some major new doors . <h> Money <p> You can be forgiven for taking a tentative look around you as you move into the New Year , wondering if you need to duck for cover or prepare for the financial tensions and challenges that greeted you last year . The answer is no , that it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on both the income and financial fronts you 're already enjoying the benefits of those challenges , especially because of their fundamental makeup . It was lucky Jupiter 's return to your financial sector in June 2013 and position here until July 2014 that created so much financial tension , not just because this put Jupiter in opposition with Pluto in your income sector , but because both were under pressure from outside forces for much of that time . What this did however was raise the bar on both fronts and where you looked back and saw financial challenges and tension , you 're now more likely to see the foundation blocks for growth and new opportunities . While it wo n't be until the middle months of the year that you 'll have a chance to achieve your full financial potential , already as you move into the New Year you should be seeing signs of income breakthroughs and glass ceilings shattered , allowing you to access what lies on the other side . Despite the fact that there is always a lot of focus on income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun always spending the first 3 weeks of January in your income sector , this will mark the end of this year 's thrust .

However , Ceres will spend 26 weeks here across two visits , with her first visit to your income sector in 4 years running from the 9th January to the 4th April and her second from the 4th August to the 28th October .

@@73187161 @1887161/ <h> 2015 Overview <p> 2015 is destined to be a vibrant and exciting year , mainly because of the partnership between three very influential planets , which because they are stationed in the three Fire signs are creating an energy that is far greater than the sum of their individual parts . In short , these planets are egging each other on and because they 're each powerful enough to stamp their influence on the year itself , you 've got to look past each individually and ask how this collectively shapes the year . The three planets I 'm referring to are Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus , one bringing your greatest opportunities , the other your challenges and the third unexpected opportunities and developments , even though in reality you 've been moving towards this for years . Where these three planets are located is in what is known as the success triad ' , with lucky Jupiter in your career sector , Saturn in your income sector and Uranus in your work sector , making this one of the most powerful and potentially game changing years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever . Jupiter returned to your career sector in July 2014 and until leaving on the 11th August , continues to expand and bring you what is your most potentially successful professional year in over a decade or since he was last here , between 2002 and 2003 . Yet this is the first time since 1932 that Jupiter has returned to find Uranus , planet of surprise , synchronicity and the unexpected in your work sector . While Jupiter and Uranus have been working together in the second half of 2014 , it 's the power of the triad that brings everything to life and that came together when Saturn returned to your income sector on Christmas Eve , for the first time since 1988 . What this will create over the course of the year is impossible to tell , for you 've never had this combined cocktail of energy to work with before , but one thing is clear , is that you 're going to gain most of your success from the challenges you 've faced in the past , which have lead you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and grasp what you deserve .

Saturn will retrograde back into your sign from the 15th June to the 18th September and Jupiter will leave your career sector on the 11th August , but in Saturn 's case this is a chance for some personal time and in Jupiter 's case there is more than enough professional momentum and ongoing support , shifting his focus onto personal and professional networking . This is a year where your home and family life needs to be your safe place to fall , your safe port in a storm and when life gets hectic and busy , the place and the sanctuary where you can recharge your batteries . <h> Love <p> You 've had planetary of activity in your romantic sector since 2003 and with Neptune not leaving until 2026 you will have for many years to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand it means that the spirit of romance is always there to tap into , in one form or another at any point in the year , but on the other hand having something always there when and if you want to tap into , often leads to a sense of complacency , giving you the option of putting this off , until the next thing you know years have passed . This makes the early months of the year especially important for matters of the heart , with Mars ' return to your romantic sector on the 13th January not only kicking things off early in the year , but in a way that will fire up your romantic passions and fighting spirit . While Mars will leave on the 20th February , with Venus returning on the 28th January , the Sun on the 19th February , Mercury on the 13th March and a total solar eclipse here on the 20th March , there is plenty of support to keep the romantic flame burning .

The only other voice your relationships will get will be during a Full Moon in your relationship sector on the 28th October . What will keep your relationships on track is communication and this is something you 'll have support for all year .

However , having turned retrograde in December and not turning direct until the 9th April , instead of looking to the future and the road ahead , Jupiter and your professional focus is more likely to be interested in the rear view mirror , as you retrace your steps and ensure no stone has been left unturned .

For the first time since 1988 you 've got Saturn in your income sector and along with Jupiter in your career sector and Uranus in your work sector these three planets are creating some powerful and game changing energy on the income , work and career fronts this year . It 's Mars ' return to your work sector on the 20th February that will get things moving on the work front , with his first visit since 2013 firing up your drives , passions , fighting and competitive spirit . From Mars ' return to your work sector on the 20th February to the Sun 's departure on the 20th April , the professional gods will throw everything they have at opening the door to new work opportunities and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the right track . The focus will shift back to career matters when Venus returns to your career sector on the 6th June , where unlike her 25 day visit to your work sector she 'll not only spend considerably longer but will make two visits , her first from the 6th June to the 9th July and the second from the 1st August to the 9th October . While the Sun and Mercury will move through during that time it 's during Mars ' visit , from the 9th August to the 25th September that lucky Jupiter will leave . This will ensure your professional passions and fighting spirit are engaged and that you 've got all the resources needed to make these some of the most potentially successful months , not just of this professional year but in a decade . <h> Money <p> It 's been several years since financial or income matters have dominated a whole year and in the past , when that happened it was for all the wrong reasons . It 's been several years since a major planet visited either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the money gods to put a stamp on the year itself . What usually happens is that the money gods will focus on financial matters in May/June each year and on income matters in November/December and in fact , the Sun only left on the 22nd December . This should mean that you 'll move into the New Year with no planetary activity in either of your money houses , but that is not what happens , for you 've reached a major and defining year for income matters , with some major undercurrents playing into that . Everything changed when Saturn returned to your income sector on Christmas Eve , for what is his first visit since he was last here in 1985/1988 . As you move into the New Year Saturn is still in his very early days , but it will be clear from the get go that you 've got an inner strength and determination that makes it hard to settle for less and with the bar raised almost impossibly high . Saturn is here to help you take your power back and while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th September , when he returns he 'll remain on task until December 2017 . Saturn is the hard task master of the cosmos , but with support from lucky Jupiter in your career sector and Uranus in your work sector , this is more a case that he 's returned to give you the power to move mountains if you have to . The only challenge you 'll face is when you do n't believe in yourself or try and put something in the too hard basket . When the Sun , Mercury , Venus and Mars move through your financial sector , creating your annual financial review , which will run from the 12th April to the 25th June , they 'll all move into opposition with Saturn , raising the bar on both fronts . While this could create some financial tension , with Saturn in your income sector this will provide the motivation needed to go above and beyond , doing whatever it takes , for as long as it takes to take your power back . It 's when the Sun , Venus and Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join up with Saturn , for the first time here in 3 decades , that you 'll really have a chance to see how far this can take you . It 's this period , from the 21st November 2015 to the 24th January 2016 that could see some major and game changing income developments . 4689 @qwx624689 4690 @qwx624690 <h> About Scorpio <p> Scorpio is good at passion .

@@73187162 @1887162/ <h> 2014 Overview <p> The one thing you can be sure of this year , is that life wo n't be dull or singularly focused . In fact , you 're likely to be juggling so many balls that all those work/life balance issues and challenges in the past are going to start making sense , especially as you 're called on to use the wisdom and experience gained . However , it 's not just work/life balance issues that you 'll have to deal with , but having the right personal and relationship balance and a balance between work and play . Chances are you 're already an adept juggler when it comes to balancing things , however where in the past this was more a case of juggling life 's different challenges , this year it 's about juggling life 's opportunities . For the first time since 2002 you will move into the New Year with Jupiter , planet of luck and expansion in your sign and while he 's been here since mid 2013 , starting the year with luck on your side is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does make this an extremely auspicious and lucky year for you , this is more about taking your personal power back , being true to who you are and to start this new 12 year Jupiter cycle of expansion in a way that is planting seeds for the future . Yet this comes just as Venus , planet of love is making her longest visit to your relationship sector in over 200 years , a visit that began on the 5th November 2013 but wo n't end until the 6th March . This puts Venus on the opposite side of the sky and in opposition with Jupiter , putting your personal and relationship needs into conflict , with the potential for some personal and/or relationship tension in the early months of the year . But this is all about finding the right balance , with the planets of love and luck naturally wanting to work together , so you get the full benefits on both fronts . At the same time the fun police are on patrol from the get go and will remain on patrol all year , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times challenging , as they push home the importance of following your heart . If you have children or little people in your life , they could be occupying more of your time and attention , especially as the first half of the year is also an extremely important time for home and family matters . Each year has certain factors that put a stamp on things , making each year slightly different and this year those themes are personal authenticity , both your personal and professional relationships , continuing professional evolution , matters of the heart and home and family matters . While a lot of these are in conflict with each other and do n't mesh well , with the right balance and boundary settings , the opportunities they all represent suggest that you have a very rich and full year ahead of you , one that is likely to be an unfolding journey . <h> Love <p> By any measure or standard 2014 is destined to be a big year for both love and your relationships . You should know all about matters of the heart by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons with Saturn , the hard taskmaster of the cosmos , in your romantic sector since October 2012 and remaining here for all but the very final days of the year . This means that you have had to take matters of the heart more seriously and also to take responsibility , but fate has also been at work , leaving you with a clear sense of what you want from love . Saturn will remain on guard and the fun police will be on patrol all year , making sure that you do n't hide behind your excuses or let life become all work and no play , as you may have done in the past . On the romantic front things are going to be very similar to what they were last year , with two exceptions . Those exceptions are firstly Ceres , goddess of the solar system 's two visits to your romantic sector , first from the 4th February to the 23rd March and then again from the 7th August to the 8th August , giving you a chance to get a deeper and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a time when you 'll have the power to move mountains if you have to . The other exception is Mars ' visit to your romantic sector from the 26th July to the 14th September . Mars did n't visit your romantic sector at all in 2013 and he 'll return to fire up your romantic passions and really get things moving . With Venus , planet of love moving through your sign from the 19th July to the 12th August she 'll be on duty when Mars returns , with these likely to be the most romantically charged weeks of 2014 . While you will have to wait until midyear for the best romantic weeks of the year , there is already something special developing on the relationship front in the early months . Because the Sun will always spend the first 3 weeks of every year in your relationship sector the focus is always on your relationships as you move into the New Year and having Venus , planet of love here is not that unusual . However Venus , who will normally spend 4 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear sense of what you want from your relationships and what they need from you and to trigger the laws of attraction , returned in November and should be long gone . Instead she 'll stay on until the 6th March , making this her longest and most auspicious visit to your relationship sector in over 200 years , giving your relationships a much needed boost . <h> Business <p> You have a chance to have a fairly quiet and measured start to your professional year , with a chance to not only get your bearings but to tie up loose ends from last year . With the Sun having just left your work sector on the 22nd December and Mercury on the 24th December 2013 , as you move into the New Year this is just days after last year 's cosmic push ran its course . At the same time that this has left you with all your cards on the table and a lot of choices and options as you move into the New Year , there is no urgency and professionally as a whole , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Uranus , the only planet active in either of your professional houses all year and the planet that has been driving your professional game since 2010 and will continue to drive it until he leaves in 2019 , is still moving at a crawl after his retrograde phase ended on the 18th December 2013 . As you move into your new professional year Uranus is still in his early weeks in direct motion and still moving at a crawl and as it wo n't be until the faster moving planets return to your career sector that things will really take off , this gives you a chance and a need to pace yourself in the early weeks of the year . After a busy and possibly frantic final weeks to your 2013 professional year and no more planetary activity in your work sector until later in the year , there is absolutely no reason to rush or push things before you have to . While the Sun wo n't return to your career sector until the 21st March , which is when your professional year will really start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 19th February will put a new dimension into play . As well as setting the scene for some game changing eclipses , the first being a total lunar eclipse in your career sector on the 8th October , this puts some new bottom lines in place , which you 'll have a chance to get a clear look at during the Sun 's visit from the 21st March to the 20th April . With Mercury moving through your career sector from the 8th April to the 23rd April and Venus from the 3rd May to the 29th May , these will be the most defining weeks of your professional year , when most of your decisions , choices and game plans will be made and your true professional objectives , desires and expectations will be defined . Apart from a Full Moon in your work sector on the 13th June , once Venus leaves your career sector on the 29th May it will be more about staying on track and keeping the professional momentum going . While you can always expect the pace to pick up on the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick off earlier than that this year , with Mars moving through from the 14th September to the 27th October , which are likely to be the busiest weeks of your year and while you 'll get your usual surge in November and December , unlike this year , where things ease back in January , giving you a chance to catch your breath , that wo n't be the case next year , with a need to pace yourself when you can . <h> Money <p> If first impressions are to be taken into account , then this is a fairly typical and ordinary year for both money and income matters , with more of the same and not much having changed from last year . The good news is that this means that you 're moving into a known quantity , with no nasty surprises , but the bad news is that this could leave you feeling frustrated , with more of the same not exactly thrilling . It 's just as well then that you ca n't judge a book by its cover , for this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block , especially when it comes to income matters . You will have to wait , but the big event on the money front this year is lucky Jupiter 's return to your income sector on the 16th July and the fact that this will kick off your luckiest , most expansive and lucrative income year in over a decade , a year that wo n't run its course until the 11th August 2015 . Your income sector is not usually active until the mid months of any year anyway , so waiting for until midyear should n't be a problem , especially as this gives you a chance to get financial and money matters up to speed first . The focus will always be on money matters in the early months of the year , with the Sun always moving through your financial sector from the 20th January to the 19th February . This is when the financial reality checks and reviews take place and usually when you realize how much you 've spent last year and over Christmas , with a dose of reality evoking a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what New Year resolutions you move into the year with , by the end of January they will either expand to include financial resolutions or will switch entirely . The Sun , Mercury and Venus will always move through at this time of year , so this is when you 're able to take care of any financial housekeeping . Last year from start to go this only took 6 weeks , but this year you 'll have 12 weeks , from Mercury 's return on the 12th January to Venus ' departure on the 6th April , giving you a chance to get money matters up to speed , with another chance in the later weeks of the year when Mars , warrior planet of the cosmos returns to whip up your financial passions and fighting spirit .

@@73187163 @1887163/ <h> 2014 Overview <p> What you have on your hands is a year of two halves , the first half more focused on having a life and the second half more professionally focused , together creating the perfect balance and very little conflict between the two . Alongside this you have some important things playing out on the money front in the first half of the year , creating a year with lots of diversity . The two most influential planets in the solar system , especially when it comes to the makeup of the year as a whole , are Jupiter and Saturn , the planets of luck and structure . Jupiter helps us to grow and achieve , while Saturn helps us to cement that through hard work , dedication and self discipline . As you move into the New Year there has been no changes from last year , with Jupiter bringing opportunities when it comes to matters of the heart and Saturn encouraging you to embrace a sense of adventure , asking that you take the privilege of having a life seriously challenging you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your comfort zone . Two planets that have a big influence at special times of the year , but not on the year itself are Venus and Mars , the planets that influence the heart and our passions , yet in the first half of the year both are acting more like major players . Venus , who normally spends just 4 weeks in a fun , social and serendipitous part of your chart , is instead spending 4 months , with her visit from the 5th November 2013 to the 6th March 2014 her longest in over 200 years . Because last year 's professional push only ended in December , that you have no planets in either of your professional houses in the first half of the year should n't be a problem , with more than enough momentum to keep things going .

The professional tide starts to turn for you when lucky Jupiter returns to your work sector on the 16th July , kicking off your luckiest year for work opportunities in over a decade , but will move to a whole new level when Mars returns to your career sector on the 14th September .

This is good news , for over recent years planetary activity in your relationship sector has meant personal and/or relationship tension and especially in the later months of 2013 , only really clearing from mid November onwards . The love gods are more focused on romance and bringing some magic back into your life with Venus , planet of love not only playing a valuable role in challenging your romantic excuses , but in triggering the laws of attraction and synchronicity in the early days of the year . For the first time since 2002 you 'll move into the New Year with lucky Jupiter in your romantic sector and in retrograde motion from the 7th November 2013 to the 6th March 2014 , is even holding the door open to second chances .

Venus will normally spend just under 4 weeks here once and sometimes twice a year , triggering the laws of attraction and synchronicity , creating the potential for serendipitous moments or encounters . Yet having returned on the 5th November 2013 , just 2 days before Jupiter turned retrograde in your romantic sector and not due to leave until the 6th March , coincidentally the same day Jupiter turns direct , Venus is making her longest visit in over 200 years .

This leaves you ready to get down to business the moment your new professional year begins , but also to decide when that is . You want to keep your head in the game and the objectives gained in the final weeks of 2013 clear in your mind , but with no more planetary activity it 's more about pacing yourself , knowing that all your cards are on the table .

In Uranus ' early days here you had Saturn in your financial sector , which created some extreme financial challenges , the likes of which you will never see again , yet whether you realize it or not you 're already benefiting from .

The Sun will always spend the first 3 weeks of any year in your romantic sector , so it 's not surprising that the focus is on matters of the heart as you move into the New Year , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as well . What is unusual is how long she 's been here and how long she 'll stay , with her visit from the 5th November 2013 to the 6th March 2014 her longest in over 200 years . Along with Pluto Venus is here to begin a revolution , refusing to let you sit on the fence . The door will even be open to second chances from the 22nd December 2013 to the 1st February 2014 . <h> Business <p> A lot can change in 12 months and the professional focus you moved into 2013 with is no longer in play , but the repercussions of that are still playing out , with your professional game having received such a massive push that the impact will be felt for years to come . You will move into 2013 with no planetary activity in either of your professional houses , giving you a chance to keep your professional hat off in the early days of the year , with a chance to clear your mind , keep your options open and also to recharge your batteries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12th January , it really is just the very early days of the year that you 'll have a chance to step back , with this the date that your 2014 professional year begins in earnest . Unlike last year , when as you moved into the New Year you were at the halfway point of a 12 month Jupiter visit , this year there are no major planetary influences in play that will keep things active all year and instead have specific times of the year where work or career matters will receive a push . This actually works to your advantage , especially with so much leverage and experience already gained , for within a specific time period you 're able to marshal your troops and channel your resources , putting everything you have into everything you do for a relativity short period of time , burning yourself out if you have to , then pulling back to recover as you let things run their course and play out . That first push will come during a 12 week period , from the 12th January to the 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only move through your work sector , but Mercury will move through twice , leaving on the 1st February but then retrograding back in on the 13th February for a double dip visit . From the 6th April you 'll have a chance to let things settle and recharge your batteries , but you wo n't have much time to rest on your laurels , for on the 8th May the only planetary activity in your career sector for the year will kick off . This time around things are even more compact , for from Mercury 's return on the 8th May to Venus ' departure on the 19th July is a period of just over 10 weeks , where most of your professional objectives , desires and expectations for the year will be decided . If there are going to be any big changes on the professional front or to your career path as a whole , this is when they 're likely to occur . Apart from a Full Moon in your work sector on the 11th August and a Full Moon in your career sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod for work and career matters , this should be all the planetary support and involvement for the year and in 2013 that was the case , with no planetary activity in either of your professional houses from the 14th July 2013 to the 12th January 2014 . However , in the final weeks of the year the planetary push that will always kick in on the work front will begin earlier , starting with Mars ' return to your work sector on the 5th December and his position here until the 13th January 2015 , by which point next year 's push will have begun , with the final weeks of the year likely to be busy and full on . <h> Money <p> While it 's not surprising that 2014 is an important year for financial matters , for with Uranus in your financial sector from 2010 to 2019 every year during this 8 year period is , it is surprising that this is an important year for income matters as well . This is a bit of a mixed blessing , for to have your income and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sit on the opposite side of the sky to each other , puts the forces in play in opposition from time to time , creating the potential for financial tension . That was definitely the case in the past , but a lot has to do with the forces in play and on the income front in particular they are extremely auspicious forces and any financial tension is more likely to keep you motivated , raising the bar on both fronts . Uranus is on a long term mission to create financial authenticity , both in terms of your approach to money matters , but also in ensuring that you 're plugged into the right opportunities and the right approach to money matters . He is the rudder that is keeping your financial situation on track , making it clear when you 're veering off course and also making sure that through the Eureka moments and insight he brings , that no opportunities pass by unnoticed . Uranus will mainly work behind the scenes , although money matters as a whole will come to the fore as the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will happen , as it always does around the time of the Sun 's annual visit to your financial sector , from the 21st March to the 20th April , which is when the money gods take you through your annual financial review and reality checks . Mercury will move through from the 8th April to the 23rd April , ensuring that this comes with a smart head for money . Venus will move through from the 3rd May to the 29th May , fueling your financial desires and expectations and triggering the laws of attraction . On its own this is a very ordinary but important chance to bring financial matters up to date and as there is n't usually planetary activity in your income sector at this time of year , should n't be a problem . Yet the fact that this is likely to create some financial tension at times , is more a case that you ca n't have your cake and eat it too , for the fact that there is even going to be any tension is because you have some extraordinary income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , planet of passion and the warrior planet of the cosmos is making his longest visit to your income sector in 3 decades , a visit that began on the 8th December 2013 but wo n't run its course until the 26th July . Mars is here to help you break through glass ceilings and fire up your financial passions and fighting spirit , creating some of the best income opportunities in decades . This and other conditions that will kick in at the same time will give you the Midas touch for the whole of 2014 , with the money gods delivering a special treat around the 15th April . 4689 @qwx624689 <p> Relationship Compatibility detailing how each of you perceives and experiences the other , examining the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship and pinpointing potential problems .

@@73187165 @1887165/ <h> July , 2017 <p> General The cosmos appears keen to encourage you to consider a new or possibly second income stream and you can bring a greater sense of financial stability and security by applying your talents in new ways . It 's the Full Moon in your sign on the 9th that brings much-needed clarity where releasing someone or something holding you back and delaying progress is concerned . It 's time to break free from a hindrance or drain on your efforts and resources . One commitment near month end might make a dent in your bank balance but any worry will be short-lived . <p> Love &amp; Romance A Full Moon in your sign on the 9th is bound to increase tension and emotions in more than one area of your world and your love life could bear the brunt of this antagonistic activity .

Ruled by dour Saturn , these practical and sensible folk do n't believe in luck - Capricorns just know that the harder you work , the luckier you get . While shying from the spotlight , Capricorn nevertheless can become quite powerful and respected , because they always put the good of the firm first - and when they have partners and families , they have an extra reason to succeed . Ambitious Capricorns will set goals and mark off each achievement as a step nearer to the pinnacle of success - running their own show . This is what every Capricorn really wants . <p> The trouble is that Capricorns can get so caught up in climbing the ladder that they neglect their relationships . Make sure you keep in touch with your nurturing side , because things get really ugly when Capricorn starts putting a price on everything .
