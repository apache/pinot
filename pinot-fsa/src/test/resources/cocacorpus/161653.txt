@@42450700 @2450700/ <h> Teaching children to generalise <p> One of the important factors involved in successful use and application of mathematics is the ability to recognise patterns and relationships and to then establish statements about these perceived patterns or relationships in general terms . The NC for mathematics describes this as generalising or making general statements . However , the ability to generalise is difficult for both adults and children , so learners need to be taught how to do this . This has implications for your practice as a classroom teacher . You can not teach children to generalise , if you can not do it yourself . It is therefore vital that you learn how to do this . You do not want to be involved in the following scenario : <p> Another very important aspect of teaching children about generalisation of mathematical patterns and relationships is that of being able to establish the veracity or falsity of general statements .

Many of these can be developed through PE as well as in mathematics and through rhymes and stories . Initially , such descriptions of positions should be in relation to the child itself , but , when this is secure , positional relationships between two objects ( other than the child ) may be explored as well . Building an understanding of ' left ' and ' right ' is also important . Many children take a long time to distinguish consistently between these terms . <p> It is important to note that many of these terms ( both positional and directional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other will have different viewpoints regarding what constitutes left or right .

@@42450741 @2450741/ <h> Abstract <p> Building on the first part of this series regarding descriptive statistics , this paper demonstrates why it is advantageous for radiographers to understand the role of inferential statistics in deducing conclusions from a sample and their application to a wider population . This is necessary so radiographers can understand the work of others , can undertake their own research and evidence base their practice . This article explains p values and confidence intervals . It introduces the common statistical tests that comprise inferential statistics , and explains the use of parametric and non-parametric statistics . To do this , the paper reviews relevant literature , and provides a checklist of points to consider before and after applying statistical tests to a data set . The paper provides a glossary of relevant terms and the reader is advised to refer to this when any unfamiliar terms are used in the text . Together with the information provided on descriptive statistics in an earlier article , it can be used as a starting point for applying statistics in radiography practice and research .

To answer this we would follow the red branches .

@@42450792 @2450792/ <h> Abstract <p> The idea that money needs to be more local ' to enable more environmentally sustainable and socially beneficial economies is a theme in a variety of conferences and initiatives that ally with the concept of transition ' to low-carbon societies . The first ever Transition Town initiative sprang up in the rural British town of Totnes in 2006 . One of its activities was to pioneer a local currency that one could purchase with British pounds . Subsequently , the Transition Network , which promotes the concept of Transition worldwide from its base in Totnes , has promoted similar schemes across the UK . In 2012 the launch of the Bristol pound in the UK generated significant media attention , as Bristol became the first city in the UK to launch its own currency and gain the support of the local council , with the Lord Mayor spending the very first Bristol pound . People must purchase Bristol pounds by using national currency , and businesses can redeem them for national currency . Almost entirely ignored by mainstream media in the past , local currencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as The Financial Times , Wall Street Journal , Guardian and Der Spiegel , as well as on both local and network TV . The reports focus mainly on attempts to keep money circulating locally instead of leaking out ' , as a way of enhancing the vitality of local economies and improving the prospects of local businesses in their struggle to compete with large corporate chains . This has been the key aim expressed by the originators of the pound-backed local currencies issued in Brixton , Bristol and elsewhere . <p> All of that is well and good , but could miss the main point of what ails our communities - and our world . The problems facing our communities , and civilization as a whole , stem from the mechanisms by which money is created and allocated by the members of the most powerful cartel the world has ever known . Our current monetary system is the main underlying cause for multiple crises with sovereign debt , environmental destruction , spiralling inequality and mass unemployment . Unless we transform the way money is issued , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the underlying problem . This insight is not widely understood by people working on social or environmental issues , even those who work on economic dimensions . As one of the authors of the original The Limits to Growth ( Meadows et al . 1972 ) report , Dennis Meadows explains : I did not think about the money system at all . I took it for granted as a neutral aspect of human society . . . . I now understand . . . that the prevailing financial system is incompatible with sustainability ' ( in Lietaer et al . 2012a : 1 ) . On average , modern humans are monetarily illiterate , not understanding the essence of money , how it is created and how this influences their experience of life . This illiteracy restricts our ability to work towards transition . In this chapter , our aim is to help relevant professionals understand the monetary origins of our current malaise , the practical steps being taken by communities to manage their own economies and exchange systems , and to map out some emerging issues for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how a focus on monetary systems can re-frame how we understand the sustainability challenge , away from being a matter of exhorting each-other to behave better ' and/or impose more restrictions on our behaviours , towards a step-by-step liberation of communities ' innate ability to thrive in the ways that they themselves determine .

It focused on observation and feedback processes ; including action planning as an integral element linked to the post-compulsory sector professional standards ( Education and Training Foundation ( ETF ) 2014 ) , as they occurred on a PGCE in PCE programme ; a one year full time postgraduate certificate in post-compulsory education course at a university . The research approach saw interactions between the researchers and the student-teachers at various stages of their development . In Semester One , individual pen portraits and focus group contributions reflected early perceptions of their development from student-teacher to teacher . In Semester Two , all students were asked to reflect back on their individual data sets and the researchers ' analyses and interpretations in a semi-structured interview . Student teachers referred to the ways in which they were actively developing and sustaining effective relationships with their students . They explored their sense of developing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practices of the contexts in which they were placed ; such as a recognition of lesson observation as a performance . It included learning from experienced teachers ( related to a community of practice model ) .

@@42450913 @2450913/ <h> Abstract <p> Introduction : Disclosure of Lesbian , Gay and Bisexual ( LGB ) orientation is identified as a continual process with negative and positive experiences holding long and short-term health and wellbeing impacts ( Ryan , Legate and Weinstein , 2015 ) . Occupational therapists claim holistic practice encompassing individuals ' diverse values , beliefs , and behaviours , yet evidence in addressing issues related to sexuality and disclosure is limited . It remains an under-researched area and from some perspectives , its relevance to occupational therapy is contested as illustrated in Couldrick ( 2005 ) . A lack of understanding of the impact of disclosure on people 's occupational lives emphasises a need for this review of existing knowledge and its relevance to occupational therapy . Method : A structured database search and critical appraisal identified 17 articles that met the review criteria relating to LGB , disclosure , health &amp; wellbeing and occupation . Data were extracted and analysed for themes according to Aveyard ( 2014 ) . Findings : The review identified the factors influencing disclosure and the impact of disclosing sexual orientation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which increased alongside LGB identity affirmation . Analysis revealed how nondisclosure or negative disclosure experiences contributed to occupational deprivation , reduced participation and occupational performance . A lack of education amongst health professionals and heteronormative ' practice was one of the key factors for negative impacts of disclosure.Conclusion : Disclosure of sexual orientation is a complex process impacting on individuals ' occupational identity , performance and engagement . This confirms the importance of developing occupational therapists ' understanding in order to support service users with an LGB orientation whom they may encounter in practice . The review has presented some foundations for future research directions and professional practice .

@@42450923 @2450923/ <h> Abstract <p> This paper explores approaches of applying the panarchy perspective to a case study of natural resource management in the cultural landscape of upland alpine pastures in northern Italy . The close interaction within the cultural landscape between alpine pasture ecology and the management regimes offers a strong fit with the concept of social-ecological systems and provides insights to appropriate and adaptive management of sites of conservation interest . We examine the limited literature available that offers a resilience understanding of such landscapes and address apparent gaps in the application through our interpretation and use of adaptive cycles and panarchy . We draft conceptual models of adaptive cycles considering ecological and socioeconomic information as acting in separate but interacting domains . Notwithstanding the difficulties in defining and measuring quantitative state variables , we found that a panarchy model can offer a powerful metaphor with practical implications for the maintenance of such alpine cultural landscapes . In effect , our panarchy interpretation of interacting adaptive cycles provides new insights into the description of and the future options for land use in our case study area . Some issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be related to system resilience , such as alternative states , shifting thresholds , and regime stability , which are all dependent on adaptive processes ; but we found quantification difficult even at a conceptual level . Nevertheless , we found it helpful to use nature conservation evaluation as a useful surrogate for measures of capital in adaptive cycles of vegetation . However , care is needed to distinguish between the descriptive metaphor using selective surrogate measures and real ecological behavior . Additionally we recognize the need to integrate this ecological understanding with cycles in socioeconomic domains and consider that interactions between the loss of both social and ecological capital would be interesting issues to explore further in our case study . We suggest that resilience theory , through its focus on adaptive cycles interacting at different speeds and across varying geographic scales , offers useful insights into resource management and in particular for nature conservation interest sites , by focusing more on dynamics than on an optimal state of species assemblages . This may help to define sites and to achieve the objectives of Natura 2000 through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation of processes , in which cultural tradition and local ecological knowledge are valued . 
@@42450926 @2450926/ <h> Extenuating Circumstances <p> Unfortunately ; there are occasions when circumstances beyond your control and unforeseen can impact on daily life . To support our students in these situations it may be appropriate to consider applying for consideration of what could be extenuating circumstances . <h> Extenuating Circumstances <p> Extenuating Circumstances ( ECs ) is a phrase which is used to describe serious and exceptional factors outside your control which adversely affected your performance during your study . These factors may have prevented you from attending examinations or other timed assessments or caused you to miss assessment submission deadlines . <p> Examples of extenuating circumstances are illness , accidents or serious family problems . Everyday occurrences such as colds or known conditions such as hay fever will not qualify unless the effects are unusually severe . Preventable situations such as printer , IT or travel issues will not be deemed to be valid . <p> A claim for extenuating circumstances may relate to the full module , or part of the module . <p> To submit an extenuating circumstances claim you require a claim form and envelope . Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be collected from your local Programme Administration office .

Alternatively you can email the EC form and supporting evidence to assessment@cumbria.ac.uk . <p> The contents of the EC claim will only be viewed by the Extenuating Circumstances Panel . The details you provide on the EC envelope will ensure the claim is presented at the appropriate meeting . Further information on the Extenuating Circumstances Panel can be found here . <h> FAQs <h> When do I need to submit my Extenuating Circumstances claim ? <p> EC claims should be submitted within 5 working days of the last assessment ( i.e. last assessment submission date or final examination ) for the module for which ECs are being claimed . <p> If you wish to submit your claim before the submission date , it must be timely i.e. not too far in advance as any documentary evidence you submit in support of your claim risks being out of date by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer apply . <h> My tutor knows about my extenuating circumstances . Do I still need to submit the form ? <p> Yes . The panel can only consider claims that have been submitted on a fully completed EC form . <h> What happens if I do n't fill in the form in full or do n't provide documentary evidence ? <p> Your claim may be deemed invalid if you fail to provide enough information or evidence for the panel to consider your case . It is essential that you include module codes , titles and submission dates on your form and submit supporting documentary , independent evidence with your claim . You must also give a clear and concise explanation about how your circumstances have impacted on your study which has led to your claim for extenuating circumstances <p> In exceptional cases , if you are incapacitated ( either due to a physical or mental illness ) and therefore not able to complete the EC form yourself , the form may be completed on your behalf by a member of staff ( e.g. Personal Tutor , Programme Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member of staff and ask them to do this for you . <h> What constitutes ' documentary evidence ' ? <p> The following are examples of documents that may be considered as evidence : <p> Medical certificate <p> Hospital/doctor 's letter <p> Solicitor 's letter <p> Death Certificate <p> Documentary evidence must be independently verifiable and therefore letters from family members or friends will not be accepted . Students must keep their Personal Tutor informed of any adverse personal circumstances . Where circumstances are of a nature that verifiable evidence is not available and your course tutor or personal tutor is aware of your situation they may provide a letter of support as evidence on your behalf . Newspaper articles , copies of internet pages or photographs ( of any nature ) will not be considered as verified evidence unless such documents directly link you to the circumstances/news stories being discussed . <p> Where medical evidence is supplied it must include dates , time frame and a medical opinion about the likely effect of illness on your ability to study for and/or submit for assessment . <p> Any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim which subsequently is identified as fraudulent will be disregarded from the purpose of the EC/appeal .

In such cases , where both elements of assessment have been failed , it is standard practice for the earlier assessment attempt to be offered first as the outcome of this assessment may impact on the potential requirement for the remaining assessment to be undertaken . <p> If your situation is of a sensitive nature and you wish to speak to a member of the PAd or the Assessment and Awards Team in private , please inform them of this so that they can make suitable arrangements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Personal Tutor or Programme Leader to seek advice before submitting ECs . <p> Staff within the Students ' Union will also be able to provide advice and assistance . 
@@42450927 @2450927/ <h> Abstract <p> The aim of this research was to discover what teachers could do to promote the benefits of studying Art and Design ( A&amp;D ) at GCSE , as the EBacc 's ( English Baccalaureate ) recent introduction has narrowed down GCSE options . Research was carried out with the hypothesis that students would neglect A&amp;Dat GCSE due to a limited understanding of the career prospects or transferable skills that A&amp;D education promotes . Research included the stigmatisation of A&amp;D education , the attitudes of students towards the subject and how the EBacc might potentially impact the number of students opting for creative GCSEs . A poster that communicated these benefits was produced in response to data . The poster , which could be displayed in A&amp;D classrooms , was trialled with a focus group and a class of Year 9 students . The Year 9 students were asked to write what they felt were the benefits of studying A&amp;D both before and after viewing the poster . The poster was found to have an 83.33% success rate .

@@42450930 @2450930/ <h> Making connections between 3D and 2D shapes <p> Usually we introduce 3D shapes before 2D shapes because 2D shapes only exist in the real world as the faces of 3D shapes . However , it is useful to make children aware of this relationship . Some possible ways of doing this include paint-printing using the faces of 3D shapes so as to produce 2D-shape prints and deconstructing ( and , later , re-constructing ) 3D shapes from sets of 2D shapes which can be clipped together such as Clixi or Polydron . This is , in effect , the beginning of working with ' nets ' ( arrangements of adjacent 2D shapes which can be folded up to form a 3D shape ) . <p> Later , this idea can be extended to the deconstruction of 3D packaging ( more confusing for children because of the presence of flaps which are not faces ) and separating the faces to obtain the individual 2D shapes .

How does photography shape our visual understanding of our home ? We all know our homes ; yet , home is one of the most elusive of concepts . There are many people who have no homes and it can certainly be considered a privilege ( and conversely a burden ) to be a homeowner . Houses that are dwellings are more than mere bricks and mortar . Home as a sense of belonging is familiar to everyone , yet so difficult to describe .

@@42450972 @2450972/ <h> Abstract <p> The EU Habitats Directive requires Member States to assess the potential and desirability of reintroducing species which have been lost , and to look at other Member States ' experiences to support such assessments . In light of these requirements , the Lynx UK Trust is proposing to undertake a trial reintroduction programme of Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx ) at several potential sites in the UK . As part of the preparation for any translocation or reintroduction programme , guidelines prepared by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) state that an assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of a reintroduction should be incorporated into planning for such programmes . On the basis of these guidelines , AECOM have been asked by the Lynx UK Trust to undertake an impartial and independent analysis of the potential economic costs and benefits to the proposed lynx reintroduction scheme in the UK based on a combination of modelling and data collected from European lynx studies . The analysis draws on the guidance for undertaking cost-benefit analysis set out by the UK government . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Book which states that a cost-benefit analysis should quantify as many of the costs and benefits of a proposal in monetary terms as is feasible , including impacts for which the market does not provide a satisfactory measure of economic value . The Green Book further states that in the early stages of identifying and appraising a proposal only summary data is normally required , while at the later stages of an assessment data should be refined to become more specific and accurate . The analysis in this report is therefore proportionate to the resources involved , outcomes at stake , and the time available . As such , the results should be taken as an initial indicative estimate of the potential costs and benefits of the lynx reintroduction scheme . This approach should provide a proportionate study for the purposes of licensing a trial of the effects of the reintroduction of lynx to the UK , with further studies of the economic impact being undertaken if the trial is adopted .

@@42450982 @2450982/ <h> Abstract <p> Internationally , initial teacher education programmes usually include trainee teachers in formal taught sessions facilitated by a teacher educator . These formal taught sessions are intended to build on and to shape the more informal workplace learning gained by supported teaching experience in schools . The formal teaching provides opportunities to foreground the trainee teachers ' experiences as learners , but the pedagogy of teacher education is complex and the intentions of teacher educators and actual learning outcomes of these sessions is uncertain . Many teacher educators use an element of modelling ' within their approach , although the frequency , nature and impact of this strategy is contested . Modelling may also be used by school based teacher educators during more informal workplace learning , for example when being observed teaching and in the ensuing debrief with a trainee teacher . This chapter argues that explicit modelling of being a learner ' by teacher educators may provide the glue ' required to make the domains of knowing and the layers of purpose in the complex pedagogy of teacher educators more coherent for trainee teachers .

@@42450996 @2450996/ <h> Abstract <p> Assessment for Learning ( AfL ) is an established learning and teaching strategy . The authors identify issues with the effectiveness of its application in the classroom . Having noted a theoretical shift from teacher-generated to pupil-generated success criteria , the authors were keen to explore how this could be realised in practice . They developed a model based on AfL principles , which they introduced to a class of Year 5 pupils . They found that , whilst pupils can identify their own success criteria , a number of issues need to be considered by the innovative teacher . 
@@42451000 @2451000/ <h> Abstract <p> At a trial established in Cumbria , northern England , significant differences in growth rate between tree species were apparent , with cider gum ( Eucalyptus gunnii ) and alder ( Alnus glutinosa ) exhibiting most rapid volume and biomass accumulation . Estimations were made of leaf area , specific leaf area , leaf area ratio ( based on stem mass not whole tree mass ) and length of growing season . These measurements were undertaken to explain tree growth difference and developing a growth potential index based on growing season length and leaf area . The high leaf area of cider gum and alder explained some of their superior growth , while alder also had the longest period in leaf , compared with ash ( Fraxinus excelsior ) and sycamore ( Acer pseudoplatanus ) . The slow growth of ash can be explained by the short period in leaf and also the relatively low leaf area ratio . Leaf area to stem weight also differed between species with that of ash being relatively low . Specific leaf area was also low for ash , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species invest highly in each unit of leaf area . Of the tree species assessed , the length of the growing season was longest for alder , enabling it to maintain growth for a longer period . By multiplying growing season by leaf area a resource capture index was calculated and this explained 56% of the variation in stem dry weight between trees . The potential and limitations for using this index are discussed .

@@42451016 @2451016/ <h> Abstract <p> This paper opens with David Cameron 's words on equality of opportunity . His assertion that we need to reach out to disadvantaged pupils is questioned through an examination of social mobility and homelessness in the UK . Analysis suggests that equality of opportunity is a societal , rather than educational issue . Using a metaphor from a Frans Francken painting , this paper argues that low achievers ' are suffocated by those above them in the social hierarchy : hope of ascent is unrealistic . This paper concludes that instead of raising aspirations , the government should re-examine the responsibility of the establishment in keeping people in their place ' .

In the current study , 91 undergraduate students ( n=44 females , n=47 males ) attending a university in North-West England read a hypothetical IPV scenario , experimentally manipulated by victim gender and perpetrator gender , and completed situational perceptions of responses . Overall , the results indicated gender had no effect on perceptions IPV , although it did affect participant responses . Specifically , male participants were less likely to encourage victims to seek help , and were more likely to ignore the situation . Scenarios which depicted male victims were perceived by participants as less serious , and were least likely to gain intervention . The findings of the current study are discussed in light of the importance of the development of services to raise awareness of IPV among students , and provide services on campus which can provide first-hand support .

@@42451045 @2451045/ <h> Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning ( APEL ) <p> APEL is the process where credit is sought for learning which has not previously been assessed and awarded credit by an academic institution or professional organisation . <p> It is learning which has taken place from a range of experiences and is often unstructured , personal and unconsciously gained . Skills , knowledge and abilities that come with this type of learning however can be equal to those gained by students following traditional courses through formal educational institutions . <p> If you feel you have covered the content of a module/ modules via your work/ life experience , APEL is a way to provide the evidence to show this and to gain credit for it . You will need to establish the learning experience ( i.e. what was the experience ? ) and then identify the learning which has taken place ( i.e. what did you learn from your experience ? ) <p> Examples of experiential learning include : <p> Work experience ( paid or unpaid/ voluntary ) , e.g. a task or project that you undertook , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed <p> Non-accredited courses , e.g. in-house training , hobbies <p> Life experience <p> Travel <p> Home and family <p> Reading and Research <p> NB .

As a result we aimed to 1 ) produce a normal CMR reference range of aortic diameters and 2 ) investigate the relationship between regional aortic size and body surface area ( BSA ) in a large group of healthy subjects with no vascular risk factors.Methods : 447 subjects ( 208 male , aged 19 " 70 years ) without identifiable cardiac risk factors ( BMI range 15.7 " 52.6 kg/m2 ) underwent CMR at 1.5 T to determine aortic diameter at three levels : the ascending aorta ( Ao ) and proximal descending aorta ( PDA ) at the level of the pulmonary artery , and the abdominal aorta ( DDA ) , at a level 12 cm distal to the PDA . In addition , 201 of these subjects had aortic root imaging , allowing for measurements at the level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinotubular junction ( STJ ) .

Aortic root and thoracic aortic diameters increased at all levels measured with BSA . No gender difference was seen in the degree of dilatation with increasing BSA ( p&gt;0.5 for all analyses ) . Conclusion : Across both genders , increasing body size is characterized by a modest degree of aortic dilatation , even in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors .
