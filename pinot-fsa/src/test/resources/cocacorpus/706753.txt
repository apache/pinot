It was also a little too loud and crowded for the relaxing beach break that we were looking for . So we left Phi Phi and headed on the boat over to Koh Lanta , an island that I had heard was much larger , quieter and less developed . <p> We had a snorkelling tour cancelled the day before on Koh Phi Phi due to bad weather , but apart from that our time on the Andaman coast had seen quite lovely weather , despite the fact that it was smack bang in the middle of the rainy season . As we headed away from Koh Phi Phi , I watched as a huge storm engulfed the small island , removing it from sight . Koh Lanta slowly came into view in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching up . It was n't until we began pulling into the pier that the storm finally did catch up , instantly covering the whole island in a huge downpour .

There were no taxis to be seen and we had little choice but to accept a ride on the smallest tuk tuk that I have ever seen . This particular tuk tuk was simply a tiny motorbike with a side car set up with a bench seat to hold a couple of people . There was just enough room to fit us both and our backpacks on , and I was happy ( and surprised ) to see that the driver had see through waterproof covers that completely surround the side car to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuk slowly made its way through the town , sounding like it was struggling to actually get anywhere .

Unsure if we were in the right place we finally saw one of the staff wave to us , pointing where to go . The main grounds of the place were flooded from the rain , so we had to walk through ankle deep water to the reception area . <p> It turned out that the place wasnt abandoned , there just was n't anyone else staying there .

Instead , we went for a walk along the main road to see what restaurants were available in the area . What we found were a whole lot of places that were closed for the low season . We ended up finding a nice cafe where we could get a decent cup of coffee and good wifi , with a 7-11 located just a few shops down the street from it . After buying a few things from the 7-11 , the rain returned in a huge bucket of water . Raincoats and umbrellas helped a little but there was no avoiding getting wet .

The terrain was alpine tussock grass , all covered in fresh powdery snow which had fallen during the night . Eventually we left the snow behind , dropping down the valley and back into the green sheep paddocks , leading us to the tiny village of Cardrona . <p> I knew nothing about Cardrona and was pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful old historic pub as well as some other old buildings .

More than this , the city is also well known for its culture . Although we did n't  stay in London , we went in for several day trips to explore this iconic city and sample what London has to offer .

Despite the chaotic events getting to Lukla , my flight still gave me an early morning arrival . The first day of the trek would only be a short half day , so I took the opportunity to take it really slow and allow myself extra time to acclimatize to the altitude . Lukla sits at 2800m and although I did n't  feel affected by the altitude- at all , I knew that setting a slow pace would be highly beneficial in the coming days . <p> I walked through the village of Lukla , which was larger than I thought , catering for all of the trekkers and climbers that generally start their trekking here .

As there are no vehicles in this area , everything that you can think of is carried up the valley by yaks and porters . I could never get over the extraordinary weight that the porters have to carry , many of them only kids . <p> Following the Dudh Kosi River valley , the trek goes through tiny villages , farms and forests with the beautiful snow capped mountains above and the glacier fed Dudh Kosi River below .

Crossing the river several times along the way I passed more tiny villages with locals going about their daily chores .

One of those days would be dedicated to the ruins of Pompeii , so we only had one day spare to visit Italys famous Amalfi Coast . Although we had experienced amazing weather in Rome , so far during our stay in Sorrento , the weather was quite terrible . From our hotel window on our first day in the town , I could watch the rain clouds make their way to the coast , engulfing the top of Mount Vesuvius across the bay . <p> The next morning the weather was n't much better , though the rain appeared to be staying away for now . Since we only had one day to see the Amalfi Coast , we decided upon visiting the town of Positano , as it was closer to Sorrento than Amalfi . My plan was to catch a ferry there , to take in the coastline from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a different perspective from high up on the hillside . <p> Wandering through the streets of Sorrento , we bought an umbrella to combat the threatening rain clouds , and made our way down the steep winding path to the harbour . - After a long slow walk , somehow managing to avoid slipping over on the wet stone steps , we made it to the ticket booth , only to find that the ferries were closed down for the day due to bad weather . Our only choice now was to take the bus . Luckily a little local bus goes between the harbour and the train/bus station , so we avoided the long steep walk back up the cliffs . <p> Sorrento Harbour <p> We got to the bus station to discover that every other tourist in town seemed to have the same problem , a huge line waiting for the Positano/Amalfi bus . With no other choice , we bought our tickets and joined the queue .

Squished up , standing in the isle of the bus , we were finally on our way . <p> The bus ride was beautiful , yet hair raising . Italians are notoriously crazy drivers , and the bus drivers are no better . The tiny narrow road winds its way along the steep hillside of the Amalfi Coast , steep cliffs dropping down below it into the incredible blues and greens of the ocean . The bus seemed way too big for the road , but the driver zoomed it along , taking the sharp turns and bends as if he were training for Formula 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping their seats or hand rails as they waited for the bus to fly over the edge of the cliff or smash into one of the other cars that were speeding in the opposite direction .

I guess to them it was . <p> Although other people did n't  seem very fond of the ride , I loved it . The scenery was incredible and the rush of the racing bus on the tiny road just made it like a true adventure , and before long we made it to the bus stop at Positano . <p> Boats on the water in Positano <p> As we made our way down the hill towards the town centre , I was instantly struck by the incredible views of the town and the coast . From the boats bobbing up and down on the beautiful blue water next to the beach , the town rises up the steep hillside . The main road and walking path heads down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views all along . <p> A view of Positano from near the bus stop <p> Narrow paved and cobble stoned streets zigzag through the town , with all kinds of old buildings , houses , shops and cafes standing beside them .

We stopped for some panini ( Italian sandwich ) at a cafe for lunch , before exploring more of the town , wandering through its tiny streets and in and out of interesting little shops . <p> One of the streets in Positano <p> At the bottom there are some more expensive restaurants and hotels , looking out over the beach and the water . So far the rain had stayed away but the clouds still threatened and the wind made the water fairly choppy , still preventing any chance of taking a boat back to Sorrento .

Here , the Mekong River splits into a maze of different channels covering a width of around 4 km , creating thousands of small islands ( around 4000 in the dry season ) . Si Phan Don is a place for relaxation and not doing anything in a hurry . Imagine yourself lying in a hammock with a book , while watching the sunset over the Mekong River that drifts by your bungalow . <p> Sunset in Si Phan Don view to Don Det from Don Khone <h> The Islands of Si Phan Don <p> There literally are thousands of islands in Si Phan Don , but only a handful of them are permanently inhabited by people .

Although all of Si Phan Don remains pretty relaxed and quiet most of the time , Don Det is where the partying types like to go , particularly at the northern end where the boat arrives . If you 're looking for something a bit more lively , this is the island for you . Don Det is also quite a small island , so it is walkable , though most people get around by bicycle . <p> Don Khone Don Khone is situated just south of Don Det and is connected to the island via an old French railroad bridge . This is the island that we stayed on as it is much more quieter and relaxed compared to Don Det . In fact , when we were there we felt like we had the island to ourselves a lot of the time , only sharing it with the locals . Don Khone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main road on Don Khone <p> Don Khong This is the largest island in Si Phan Don , and also the least visited as it is located further north from Don Det and Don Khone , where most of the popular attractions are .

Head here if you want to stay away from any crowds . <h> Things to do in Si Phan Don <p> Si Phan Don is more about relaxing and enjoying the peacefulness and slow pace of this part of the world . There are plenty of things to do to keep you busy though , in between hammock sessions . <h> Somphamit Waterfall <p> In Si Phan Don , the entire Mekong River drops in altitude , tumbling down a series of low waterfalls , creating a spectacular sight .

There are lots of roads on the islands that lead through some beautiful areas , plus cycling is a lot of fun . You can also cycle across the bridge between the islands of Don Det and Don Khone . Most places rent bicycles for 10,000 kip per day . <p> Cycling around Don Khone <h> Dolphin Viewing <p> There is a small pod of Irrawaddy Dolphins that inhabit a part of the Mekong River at the bottom tip of Don Khone , and there are boats there that can take you out to view them . These dolphins are very rare and should be treated with respect .

Even in a city such as Paris one of the most visited cities in the world I was determined to get away from the iconic landmarks of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre and find something a little , well , different . To do this , I decided to head under the streets of Paris and into the citys deep , dark catacombs . <p> You would n't know it when you are wandering through the streets of Paris , but under your feet are miles and miles of old tunnels that have been there for centuries . This is n't entirely unique for an old city , but what makes these particular tunnels different is that they are filled with human bones .

This led me to an arched chamber , and further on , I stepped through a doorway and my jaw dropped . In this new chamber , the walls were completely made up of human bones .

They sit on top of a hill overlooking the harbour and are in excellent condition . The view of the harbour is well worth visiting even if you are n't  interested in the towers . <p> Entrance to Po Nagar costs 20,000 Dong ( $1 ) and if you go by bicycle like I did , it costs 1000 Dong to park your bike . <p> Hon Chong Promontory <p> This rocky headland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern beach . - Its a scenic spot that provides great views of the coconut palm fringed beaches and the islands out to sea .

The pagoda itself is interesting with its impressive artwork , but I found the best part was the huge white Buddha located on the hill behind the pagoda . Its a bit of a climb up lots of stairs , but worth it for the Buddha and the views of the city . <p> Visiting Long Son Pagoda is free , but you will be hassled to buy postcards from people who claim to be students .

I rented a bicycle for 40,000 Dong ( $2 ) for the day from my hotel . <p> I 've visited all your great recommendation and the most i love that hit the beach .

@@83696308 @5196308/ <p> I should be writing about my travels through Vietnam right now , but all I can think about is what I witnessed today . This post is jumping a month ahead from my last post to the city of Phnom Penh in Cambodia , to this very day when I visited the Choeung Ek Killing Fields and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum . Today , I saw what humanity is like at its worst . <p> Before I continue , I should warn you that this post will not be a happy one , and it contains images , footage and descriptions that will be disturbing to you ; however if you would like to learn about the horror that the people of Cambodia went through during the reign of the Khmer Rouge , please read on . <p> On this blog I like to promote travel as a way to make you smile and be happy with every moment , but I also believe that travel is the best education that you can receive . Sometimes that education will not put a smile on your face , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world a little better . This often means learning what mankind is like at its best and its worst . <p> Honestly , I was n't looking forward to visiting S-21 ( Tuol Sleng Prison ) or the Killing Fields in Phnom Penh , but I knew it was something that I had to do . <p> The memorial stupa at the Choeung Ek Killing Fields <p> As I wandered through Choeung Ek and listened to the audio guide , I was often shocked by what I was listening to , even though I had read a little about it before . I walked past huge depressions in the earth that marked the sites of the mass graves of over 8000 innocent people who were murdered for nothing . These people were only a few of the near 3 million people who died during the mass genocide of the Khmer Rouge , and this was only one of many killing fields in the country . <p> Just a few of the mass graves at Choeung Ek <p> From one grave to the next , I learnt about the Khmer Rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other leader that has committed such crimes against humanity , Pol Pot , the leader of the Khmer Rouge , believed in an ideal race . He eliminated education , religion and culture and drove everyone out of the towns and cities to work on organized farms . Anyone who was against his beliefs were considered enemies and executed . <p> As bad as this was , the way in which these executions were handled was even worse . Bullets were expensive , so the prisoners were made to kneel next to their grave and then killed using any tool available , including machetes , hammers , shovels , hoes and bamboo clubs . One of these mass graves contained over 400 corpses . <p> The edges of these sugar palm fronds are lined with jagged thorns and were sometimes used to slit the throats of the prisoners <p> As I moved on , I discovered that there was simply no mercy for anyone . Soldiers were made to execute everyone , including women and children . Babies had their heads smashed against trees and then thrown into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and killed as well . It is also believed that many of them were raped first . <p> Any soldier who disobeyed orders was also killed . A mass grave was found here that contained over one hundred headless corpses who were wearing soldier uniforms . <p> This tree was used to smash babies heads in to kill them . When this site was found this tree was covered in blood , brains and bone fragments . <p> I was feeling sick as I saw displays of victims ' rags and bones that had occasionally shown up on the surface after heavy rains . In the centre of the site is the huge memorial stupa which contains thousands of skulls and bones of these people , which stands in memory of what happened here . <p> Skulls of victims inside the memorial stupa <p> I was only witnessing a small part of the horror that this genocide really was . The prisoners who were sent here for execution came from the S-21 ( Tuol Sleng Prison ) in Phnom Penh , and this was now where I was heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S-21 ) looks like an old abandoned school . This is actually what it originally was before the Khmer Rouge took over Phnom Penh . They transformed this former site of learning into a facility for torture , interrogation and murder . There were so many prisoners here that they had to end up opening the killing fields to send them for their execution . <p> One of the buildings at S-21 <p> The facility has been left exactly as it was when the Khmer Rouge were driven out in 1979 , apart from the last 14 victims who were killed here and left in the facility . They are now buried within the grounds . <p> From room to room I saw beds with shackles where people were tortured and interrogated . Amongst the dust on the floor there are bloody footprints and splattered blood on the walls and floors . I could feel only death and horror in these rooms . <p> A bed in one of the interrogation/torture rooms <p> Photo of the corpse of the last victim in this room before the Khmer Rouge abandoned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor of one of the rooms <p> Blood splattered on a wall <p> Piles of shackles <p> A few of the tiny cells <p> Blood and chains on the floor of a cell <p> This was used to hang people upside down by a rope until they lost consciousness , before holding their heads in the bowls below which were filled with filthy water usually used as fertilizer . Once they awoke again they would continue their interrogation . <p> In the next building are the photos of those who were brought here . The Khmer Rouge documented everything . For some reason I felt the need to look into the eyes of every victim , to try and understand what they must have felt . Some were skin and bones , others looked like they had just stepped into the building and had no idea what was about to happen to them . There are photos of men , women , children , elderly people , even babies . Every face that I was looking at was murdered , all for nothing . <p> Just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims <p> They also photographed the deceased <p> When I got to the end of the museum after viewing some of the torture devices , I walked into another room displaying yet more bones of those who died during the genocide . I tried to light a stick of incense to put at the small shrine here , but my hand was shaking so much that it took me five goes to even light it . I was filled with dread and sadness , but also anger towards the political and judicial side of this whole thing . I am left with more questions now than I had before I even visited Cambodia . <p> A painting depicting a scene at Tuol Sleng Prison <p> Why , after all of this , was the Khmer Rouge still acknowledged as the true government of Cambodia , and even aided by developed countries such as the UK , USA and even my own country , Australia ? They kept their seat at the UN until 1993 . <p> Why on earth did it take until 2007 for the leaders of the Khmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to be arrested for their crimes against humanity ? With lawyers defending them , their trials have gone on for years . Pol Pot himself died while under house arrest in 1998 at the age of 72 and never even stood trial . Ieng Sary just died earlier this year at the age of 87 , again before the verdict was settled . Nuon Chea was the first to fully admit to and apologise for his crimes on March 31st this year , at the age of 86 , but this is far too late . These men got to live full lives . The babies and children that were murdered did n't  even get to start theirs . Where is the justice ? <p> What happened here in Cambodia still lives on through memory today . It was n't that long ago , and it is still fresh in many peoples minds . If you do decide to visit Cambodia , please make sure to visit Tuol Sleng and the nearby killing fields . It will not be easy , but it is important to really know what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget what I learnt today . <p> Finally , please take a look at this footage that I filmed while walking through Tuol Sleng Prison . I decided to leave it in silence in respect for all those who died . <p> I wrote a similar post when I visited the prison and the fields for the second time last year . It sends shivers down my spine thinking about it . The audio guide they have introduced at the fields is simply fantastic and very informative.Jennifer recently posted .. The best of Australia and New Zealand cruises <p> Hi Jennifer . I agree , the audio guide is really fantastic . I learnt so much from it .

To actually witness the aftermath of the barbaric acts committed there is something that will stick with me forever . I walked around the fields in complete silence with the same look of disbelief on my face as everyone else there . <p> When I visited the prison , I stood inside one of the cramped brick cells trying to image what the prisoners felt . By far , the hardest thing to see was all of the faces of the people who were tortured before being executed at the killing fields . It was a humbling experience indeed . <p> Hi Travis .

@@83696310 @5196310/ <h> A Journey to Chiang Saen and the Golden Triangle , Thailand <p> Dean WickhamNovember 14 , 2012 <p> It was a hot and humid day in Chiang Rai , Thailand , as I sat sweating in my bus seat at the central bus station . A lady outside was going from window to window selling tubes of bamboo stuffed with sticky rice . The lady sitting in front of me purchased a tube for 15 Baht , and I shook my head with a smile to say " no thank you " . What I really wanted was for the bus to start moving to get some air coming in through the open windows . " Chiang Saen , Chiang Saen " I could hear the bus ticket lady yelling out repeatedly outside the door of the bus , stating the name of our destination for any waiting passengers . The bus driver was no where in sight , and it became apparent that the bus would n't be leaving until it had a decent amount of passengers to start off with . <p> Eventually , as the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopped in the drivers seat and we were off travelling through the streets of Chiang Rai . <p> I had decided today to make my own way out to explore the infamous Golden Triangle , while stopping to see the ancient ruins in Chiang Saen on the way . I had no real idea of how to get there , so I just walked to the bus station and hopped on the next bus to Chiang Saen . <p> As we left the outskirts of Chiang Rai , the busy streets and buildings gave way to beautiful green rice fields . The warm breeze that came through the window was a welcome relief from the- sweltering- heat that had engulfed the bus when it was stationary at the bus station , and the views of the countryside was a nice change from the city that I had been exploring for the past couple of days . <p> The road that we travelled passed through small towns and villages on its way to Chiang Saen , and I noticed that there were a lot of houses that seemed to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water from recent rains . I did n't  know it at the time , but this was the start of the terrible flooding that would eventually affect much of Thailand in the coming weeks . <p> Eventually , after the bus stopped in several towns to drop off and pick up passengers , we passed through the ancient walls that surround Chiang Saen , and entered onto the main street where the bus service ended . I walked along the street , passing several street food stands and market stalls on the way . Shops selling random items lined one side of the street , and at its end I crossed another main road that put me right on the banks of the mighty Mekong River . Some locals sat under a tree on a wooden bench in deep conversation , while a man on a bicycle slowly rode past me , seemingly not in any hurry to get anywhere . I walked along the river for a while before turning around and heading back down the main street to find something for lunch . <p> The Mekong River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different food stands and restaurants that I found , I noticed something that I was n't entirely used to here in Thailand . I seemed to be the only tourist in town , or at least if there were others in town , they werent anywhere near here . I could n't really work out why . <p> After yet another delicious local Thai meal , I set out in the early afternoon sun to find some of the ruins of the ancient city of Chiang Saen . Some ruins in the city date back a very long time , but the majority are from its heyday when Chiang Saen was built into a walled city during the 13th and 14th centuries , and it became a part of the ancient Lanna Kingdom . It of course fell with the rest of the kingdom to the Burmese and was sacked again by the Thais at the start of the 19th century . It was left abandoned after this time until the start of the last century when people began settling here again . What these events resulted in is the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ancient chedi in Chiang Saen <p> A tree has grown over some ruins in Chiang Saen <p> I found a few ruins of ancient temples as I wandered along the main street , but the most impressive was Wat Chedi Luang which is still used as a working temple today . When I eventually reached the ancient walls of the city , despite the sweltering heat , I stupidly decided to continue to walk along the road that follows the wall through the town . The hot afternoon sun was almost unbearable , and each part of the walls all looked the same , so I began to lose interest . <p> A Buddha statue on the wall of Wat Chedi Luang <p> The viharn in Wat Chedi Luang uses the foundations of the original temple , with a modern roof over the top . <p> Walking along the ancient walls in Chiang Saen <p> In Thailand , I have never had a problem finding a tuk tuk driver when I needed one because they are literally everywhere , but here , there was n't a single tuk tuk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town before returning back to the main street . Pouring with sweat and desperate for a bit of shade , I finally found the " bus stop " for a songtheaw service that runs from Chiang Saen to Mai Sai via the Golden Triangle , and happily sat for about half an hour while I waited . <p> I sat in the back of the songtheaw ( pick up truck ) with a lady and her young son , who both got off in what seemed like the middle of nowhere . I was beginning to wonder if I was actually going anywhere near the Golden Triangle , and if I was , I had no idea where I supposed to hop off . My worries were soon put to rest though , as I suddenly found out where all of the tourists were . The Golden Triangle , with its hoards of tourists , shops and tour buses , was a huge change of scenery to the quietness of Chiang Saen . <p> A sign at the Golden Triangle <p> A huge elephant statue at the Golden Triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This place was obviously here simply to lure in tourists , and I instantly knew that this was n't the place for me . I located the hill that allows you to look out at the meeting of the three countries that make up the Golden Triangle ( Thailand , Laos and Myanmar ( Burma ) ) , and passed a couple of old temples on the way . The heat was terrible , and despite my endless consumption of water , I was feeling dehydrated as I made it to the top . Although this was obviously a huge tourist trap , the view was quite nice . <p> A temple on the way up to the viewpoint <p> View of the Golden Triangle , standing in Thailand with Myanmar ( Burma ) on the left and Laos on the right of the Mekong River <p> I had now seen the Golden Triangle that everyone seemed to rave on about , and I was ready to get the hell out of there .

Of all of the places in Thailand that I could have been stuck in , this was n't one that I would choose . <p> It took me a while , but I eventually managed to get a ride back to Chiang Saen on the back of a motorbikefor a price of course . Hanging on for dear life , the motorbike raced along the road , flying past bicycles and other vehicles . I was dressed only in shorts , a t shirt and flip flops , and I had no helmet . The situation was n't safe by any standards , and I could only hang on and hope that I would make it in one piece . Still , despite all of this , I could n't keep the smile off of my face . <p> When we made it onto the main street in Chiang Saen by late afternoon , I paid my driver and managed to hop on what I was told was the last bus of the day back to Chiang Rai . <p> The Golden Triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day was a whole lot of fun . This is why I love independent travel . You can not have these experiences any other way , and for me , this is what travel is all about . <p> Nice Post Dean- We went up to Chiang Saen last month , and like you we seemed to be the only non-Thais around too was a nice place = We did n't  venture to the golden triangle though , just stuck with the fab view from the banks of the Mekong ! <p> Thailand is one of my favorite places and I have been there 3 times . Whenever I go Thailand I always hire a bus to visit the places as hiring a bus gives me all the freedom and comfort so if you are planning to go Thailand then do n't  forget to hire a bus for better experience .

@@83696314 @5196314/ <h> The Roluos Group of Temples in Angkor , Cambodia <p> Dean WickhamAugust 30 , 2013 <p> When we finally made it to Siem Reap to visit the Temples of Angkor in Cambodia , I had no idea where to start . Should we do what most people do and just head straight to Angkor Wat ? Should we visit Ta Phrom , Banteay Srei or some of the lesser visited temples first ? I spent a while tossing up between the options , and in the end decided that we should start where Angkor itself started . We decided to visit the Roluos Group of Temples some of the oldest in the region , dating back to the 9th century . <p> The three temples that make up the Roluos Group are all that remains of Hariharalaya the first capital city of the Khmer Empire in the Angkor region .

It really only has one tower in decent condition , which was under restoration when we visited , but the surrounding modern Buddhist temple and monastery are interesting to check out . <p> The monks at the monastery run a school for orphans and those families who ca n't afford to send their children to school .

Obviously you can also help with donations etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roluos Group first .

The temples are located about 13km to the east of Siem Reap , so you could certainly ride a bicycle if you really wanted to . The ride is mostly on the busy and dusty highway though , and it can get very hot , so I would n't recommend it . <p> You only need a few hours or no more than half a day to see the three temples , so you could easily combine the trip with a visit to the stilt villages on Lake Tonle Sap , or head to the remote jungle temple of Beng Mealea . <p> When I see pictures like the one " Bakong " , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hope to see it someday But do you think I will have the chance to see it without swarms of tourists around me ?

Old French Colonial buildings surround the towns central market , and the picturesque Mekong River provides a perfect scene at sunset . Many people come here primarily to view the rare Irrawaddy Dolphins that live in the area , but the town has enough to offer to make spending a few days well worth it . <h> Things to do in Kratie <h> Dolphin Viewing <p> Kratie is the best place in Cambodia to view the rare freshwater Irrawaddy Dolphins that inhabit the Mekong River . A pod of these small dolphins live in a stretch of the river that is around 15km north of Kratie in a village called Kampi . To get there , you can take a tuk tuk or motorbike taxi , or take yourself by rented scooter or bicycle to the village , where you can hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dolphins . Viewing the dolphins costs $9 per person for up to two people in the boat . If you have a larger group , the price drops to $7 per person . The motor boat will take you out into the middle of the river and then turn off the engine and paddle the boat with an oar so as not to disturb the dolphins . They stay out there for about an hour , so you will definitely see some dolphins . They pop up for air quite regularly . <p> We arrived by hiring a scooter from our guesthouse for $7 for the whole day . <p> Irrawaddy Dolphins in the Mekong <h> Koh Trong <p> Koh Trong is a long island in the middle of the Mekong River and can be seen from the riverbank in Kratie .

On the island , the ferry simply pulls up at the river bank where you hop off . <p> We rented our bicycles from our guesthouse for $1 each for the whole day . <p> Koh Trong <h> Mekong sunsets <p> Kratie has some of the best Mekong Sunsets that you will ever see . Locals and tourists alike all head down to the river at around 7pm each night to watch the sun slowly sink down over the river .

You Hong Guesthouse is located directly across from the market . The rooms are basic , but for $5 per night , we had nothing to complain about . It was clean and comfortable enough , the owners are friendly and their food is n't bad either . <h> Where to eat in Kratie <p> You 'll probably find yourself eating a lot of your meals at your guesthouse ( or others ) in Kratie , as there are n't  a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we arrived at night and took a while to find a place to stay , our first meal was at our guesthouse , and we werent disappointed .

Even the meat you get served at the restaurants comes from the same place . It is perfectly safe .

We just had some trouble as the first three or four places that we tried were full at the time . We rarely book places in advance . There are a couple of places further down the road as well along the riverfront if I remember correctly . Its good to hear that you can get food easily at the market . I found that I had to point to get what I wanted as I do n't  speak Khmer apart from a couple of basic words . I only tried the one stall though .

Cheers and happy travels . <p> Hi Dean , As you say pointing is the effective way without language and to be honest this is what I use and usually at most stalls you can either look at what others are eating or see from the display the type of things that the stall offers . True you might not always know what you are eating which may be a problem for some with allergies or are choosey about what they eat . <p> The point you raise about the buses is true . it is possible to undertake the journey from most places with one bus company however as you say it will often involve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible in a day or involve a night bus which I would not recommend in Cambodia <p> Hopefully people will read your post and visit kratie because together with Kampot they are great smaller towns to visit and indeed hopefully it will encourage further exploration of Cambodia as there are many places well worth the trouble and effort of visiting <p> Ca n't wait to go back to Cambodia although these days I usually just stay in a small village and soak up life there <p> Hi Alistair .

I spent the rest of the afternoon just resting up , before meeting up for my first activity in the late afternoon . Today we were going to visit a traditional Tharu village , the local- indigenous people of the Terai . <p> By this time of the day the temperature was quite pleasant , and the walk through the village was lovely .

I did n't  learn a lot about their particular religion , and did n't  see much in the way of shrines or other obvious signs of religion , but from what I could tell they seem to link themselves to the natural environment , worshipping gods of the forest etc . This is apparently some form of Hinduism , however some Tharu people have converted to Buddhism or Christianity in more recent times . <p> One of the first things that I noticed as soon as I began walking down the street was how friendly the people are . Although shy , they smiled at me and seemed to be truly interested in helping me learn about their village .

Here I sat and watched the sun go down over the Terai , and I had a sense of peacefulness come over me . I was really looking forward to the next few days of exploring the Chitwan region .

This town is the site of Australias most famous bushranger battle Ned Kellys Last Stand . I remember learning all about Ned Kelly in school , and although he was an outlaw , it was his story that I found most interesting . <p> Ned Kellys story takes us back to the 1800s , when the country of Australia did n't  even exist yet . Back then , the country was split into several different colonies of the British Empire that now make up the states of Australia . Neds parents originated from Ireland , his father ( John Kelly ) a former convict who moved to Victoria on release met Neds mother ( Ellen Kelly ) . The Kellys had seven children , the oldest son being Edward ( Ned ) Kelly . <p> Ned was brought up in a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His family was suspected of horse and cattle stealing , and his father ended up in prison to serve 6 months for stealing a farmers calf . His Irish heritage meant that he was treated poorly in the prison , which ultimately led to his death . This was just the start of Neds anger towards the authorities . <p> Statue of Ned Kelly in Glenrowan <p> What followed was a lot of different charges against the Kelly family , most of which were false and led to the obvious targeting of the family by the police . <p> Ned Kellys bushranging days came about after a police officer ( Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick ) , drunk and against orders , went to the Kelly house to arrest Neds brother Dan for horse stealing while Ned was away . He waited at the Kelly house for Dan to return , where he made his arrest . Unable to provide a warrant , Neds mother Ellen challenged him , where Fitzpatrick pulled a revolver on them and threatened them all . Dan then managed to corner him and relieve him of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rode onto Benalla where he claimed that he was attacked and shot by- Ned , Dan , Ellen , Bricky Williamson and Bill Skillion who he claimed were armed with revolvers . Ned told the police that he was not present at the time of the incident and that Fitzpatricks wounds were self inflicted . Police arrested and imprisoned his mother Ellen along with Bricky Williamson and Bill Skillion and a reward was offered for Neds arrest . <p> Furious with the injustice , Ned and Dan went into hiding in the bush where they were joined by their friends , Joe Byrne and Steve Hart who formed the infamous Kelly Gang . <p> The Kelly Gang was hunted for a couple of years by the police as they continuously robbed banks and stole horses in their rebellion . Ned Kellys last stand happened in the town of Glenrowan where they planned on stopping the police train by pulling up some tracks in the town . With the towns residents as hostages in Ann Jones Inn , Ned , Dan , Joe and Steve faced off against the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each weighed about 44 kilograms covering their torsos and heads , but leaving their legs unprotected . The weight of the armour heavily limited their movements . <p> The railway station in Glenrowan <p> Their attempt to derail the train failed due to a released hostage waving down the train before it got there . The police therefore laid- siege against the Kelly Gang inside the inn . It was at dawn on the 28th of June , 1880 , when the firing began . Both parties fired on each other throughout the day , with the police receiving reinforcements from nearby stations . Joe Byrne had been shot while drinking whisky at the bar . Amongst the firing , Ned had somehow moved out of the inn to attack the police from the rear , firing upon them with a single revolver while using the surrounding trees as cover , despite being injured . The police charged him , firing upon him heavily without affect due to his armour . When they realised that his legs were unprotected , he was brought down with two shots where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his wounds were treated , six bullet wounds in total . <p> Site of Ann Jones Inn in Glenrowan <p> The siege on the inn continued during this time while Dan Kelly and Steve Hart released the hostages and continued to fire on the police , their armour protecting them . Eventually , the firing stopped and the police set the inn on fire . When Dan and Steves burnt bodies were found , it was believed that they had shot each other . It is still unknown whether they were shot during the siege or committed suicide . <p> Ned Kelly stood trial on the 19th October , 1880 , and was hung on the 11th of November at Melbourne Gaol . A petition to spare his life apparently attracted around 30,000 signatures . Ned had a great following of- sympathizers . <p> The spot where Ned Kelly was shot down and captured <p> As I wondered around Glenrowan , it was hard to picture such a bloody battle happening here . I walked across the railway line to where the siege took place , stood at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand and where Dan , Joe and Steve died . I then walked past the old police station to the spot where Ned had finally been shot down and arrested . I had no idea what to think . Was Ned really a bad person ? Sure , he had done some bad things , but his ultimate demise was due to his anger at the injustice towards his family . I imagine that if I was in his shoes back in those days , I would have been just as angry . Ned was n't a blood thirsty killer as he was made out to be . He simply wanted a fair go . He simply loved his family . <p> It was only at the beginning of this very year , nearly 133 years after his death , that Ned Kellys remains were finally returned to his- family . His last wish was to be buried at the Greta Cemetery with the rest of his family . I went there to pay my respects . <p> Ned and the Kelly Familys tomb stone in Greta Cemetery .

The cool , misty morning air had now given way to the warmth of the day , and as the sun shined down upon us through the leaves of the trees , we soon emerged from the forest at the parks Elephant Breeding Centre . <p> I was excited about seeing some baby elephants and finding out what the park is doing to protect these endangered animals , however I was sceptical . Elephants are one of my favourite animals , I find them fascinating and intelligent , and I have a huge amount of respect for them , however I have heard all the stories in the world about how badly these incredible creatures are often treated , particularly in poorer nations that simply cant afford to take care of them properly . I was hoping that an elephant breeding centre in a National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of those stories come from . <p> The first thing that I noticed when I began walking into the centre were elephants being exercised by their mahouts . This was a positive first site , as I was afraid of seeing them chained up in a tiny enclosure . The mahouts were riding on the elephants heads , and moving off in different directions into the park , apparently going for their morning exercise . Our guide told us that this happens twice a day and includes different activities and swims in the river . <p> Baby elephants and their mother <p> When the elephants are n't  out participating in their activities , they are kept in open shelters that are basically just a roof to keep the rain off of them . There are no bars or fences , but unfortunately they do have to keep a chain around one of their feet to stop them wandering off . Its not something that I wanted to see , however I could understand as the guide explained that they want to build a proper fenced enclosure for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The baby elephants did n't  have any chains around their feet , as they would never wander far from their mothers . The keepers begin putting chains around their feet when they reach a certain age to begin getting them used to it for when they are older . This particular mother in the photo above seemed to be quite content , and she had two young twins , only a few months old , and one older calf from her previous birth . They wandered around freely , the two young ones staying very close to their mother while the older one was a bit more adventurous and curious to check us out . <p> Further along I came across one particularly adventurous baby who was happily playing with a stick ( which was more of a branch to me ) . As I stood and watched him playing with this stick , he seemed to decide that I should join in the fun .

I was so- enthralled- that I had n't  even noticed that the rest of the group were all waiting for me to join them so that we could leave . <p> I hurried back to them and we made our way to the river , where we were ferried across in another dugout canoe , and got back in our jeep to continue on our journey . <p> Reflecting on my experience at the Elephant Breeding Centre of Chitwan National Park , Nepal , I honestly believe that they do care about the elephants and their welfare . Unfortunately for a country as poor as Nepal , there is very little funding to go to these places , and things like chains around the elephants feet will remain until they can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chains , I was fairly satisfied that the elephants health is taken care of .

If they had more money the centre could be an excellent facility for elephant conservation . One question that I did n't  get to ask was what they do as far as releasing elephants into the wild . <p> Another thing that I would like to note is that this breeding centre was much different , and a huge improvement on the elephant camp that I recently visited in Thailand . <p> Have you been to any elephant- sanctuaries , breeding centres or camps ?

Staying in the quieter area between Khao San Road and the Chao Phraya River , we walked to the river front and made our way to the Phra Summain Fortress . We were sitting there on a bench with our map out , figuring out where to go next when the scam started . <p> Phra Sumain Fortress <p> So far all of the Thai people that we had met had been lovely and so , when a lady that apeared to be walking past stopped to help us , we thought she was just being nice like any Thai person would . She asked where we were trying to get to and I stupidly said that I 'm not sure . She explained that she is a teacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and I thought it was quite possible that she could be a teacher . <p> She began telling us that today was a big Buddhist holiday and that the Grand Palace is closed until 1pm , but that some temples in another certain area have free entry for tourists today . She also said that the government is giving tuk tuk drivers special coupons for the holiday to take tourists around for only 10baht each . The last thing she told us was that T.A.T ( Tourism Authority of Thailand ) was giving out free information today at the office that she pointed out on the map . <p> The way that I have written it does n't  sound so convincing , it was the way that she said it . She talked so honestly and made it seem like it was our choice , at no point did it seem like she was forcing anything on us . She seemed to be honestly trying to help us . <p> She called a tuk tuk over that appeared to simply be driving past at the time , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . She spoke in Thai to him pointing out the points of interest on our map and also spoke english to us . He said that its no problem and that he can take us around to those places for only 20baht for the two of us , because the government will fund his fare for the day . <p> We had n't  caught a tuk tuk yet and it all sounded very ligitimate . I was still sceptical but I felt comfortable enough to take the chance and we accepted the offer . <p> Our first tuk tuk ride ever was good fun and the driver took us straight to our first destination , Wat Indraviharn with its 32m tall standing Buddha . He had n't  asked for any money yet so we explored the temple , but did n't  know whether he would be there when we got back or not . Surely enough he was there waiting for us patiently . <p> The 32m tall Standing Buddha at Wat Indraviharn <p> He then took us to the T.A.T office , which was located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like every other travel agent that I had seen so far . I had began to become more sceptical . <p> The travel agent was also very convincing and I needed to book our onward journey to Chiang mai in the coming days . I booked our tickets , not knowing whether we would actually get them or not . <p> There did n't  appear to be any communication between the travel agent and our driver , so I still was n't sure if I was being scammed or not . Our driver then took us to our next temple , Wat Sommonat with its " Lucky Buddha " . This is where the next person in the scam came into play . <p> We were greeted by a man at the entrance to the small temple , where we were told to remove our shoes and enter . We were the only tourists there , but that did n't  bother me . The man began conversation with us and he seemed genuinely friendly and I believed that he was there helping with the temple , as I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Lucky Buddha " and showed us how to pray for good luck . <p> The " Lucky Buddha " at Wat Sommonat <p> He then asked us where we were going next and we told him that we were going to the Golden Mount . He confirmed what our driver had told us earlier , telling us that it is closed from 12-1pm , so while we are waiting we could visit a factory near by where we can buy cheap clothes . Our driver had mentioned this before and this man had made it seem ligitimate . We went along for the ride . <p> Riding a tuk tuk through Bangkok <p> I did n't  know what to expect from this " factory " . I was sceptical and I was right as we arrived at a tailor shop . The driver told us that we must look so that he can get his coupon . We entered and spent about 10 minutes going through the annoying process of explaining that I do n't  need a suit and getting out of the shop . The man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit . <p> When we got back in the tuk tuk I told the driver to take us straight to the Golden Mount , he agreed and did what I asked . <p> We spent some time exploring the Golden Mount , climbing to the top and taking in the excellent views of Bangkok city . By this time though we were hot , hungry and tired . We wanted to go back to our guesthouse . <p> View of the temple and Bangkok city from the Golden Mount <p> When I told the driver that we want to go back to the guesthouse , he agreed but said that we have to go to one more shop . I said no and that I do n't  need a suit . Still politely he said that he needs us to just look so that he can get his coupon . I was getting very frustrated and said that I will look at the shop if he takes us straight back to the guesthouse afterwards . He agreed and took us to another tailor shop . <p> By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not in any mood to put up with anyone hassling me . I walked into the shop , told them that I do n't  want to buy a suit and walked out . I might have been rude , something that I would not usually do at all , but I was done with being polite when I was clearly being scammed . <p> The tuk tuk driver was almost apologetic and said thankyou to me about five times . He took us straight back to our guesthouse , I gave him the 20baht that we had originally agreed on and it was over . I had learnt my lesson . <p> To be honest , when I think about it now , we actually had a good day out and it basically cost us nothing . All it really cost us was 20baht and about half an hour of our wasted time . <p> For 20baht we got a half day tour of Bangkok , a fun tuk tuk ride and visited three temples . Were we scammed ? Yes , absolutely , but at no time were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money or belongings , even the travel agent turned out to be ligitimate , we got our tickets no problem at all . The tailors would have probably been the same if I had ordered something . So in a way I 'm actually glad that it happened , I saw and learned a lot about the city . <h> Related <p> Wow ! Believe it or not , I was victim to the exact same scam . Literally each of those sites in the exact same order . I did n't  realize the first guy in my scenario was a scam until just now , although I did figure out early on how to play the game as good as them . I just pretended to be interested in the suits as if it was my job , my payoff being a cheap tuk tuk ride . Thanks for the memory ! <p> Great story/recap . Sounds like all things considered you had yourself a pretty good day for pennies . I remember getting that same shpeal from the guys outside the Grand Palace . They took our guidebook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninvolved " tuk tuk driver to agree and my wife and I were just about to go along when we realized that what was happening to us was EXACTLY what someone had warned us about just hours earlier . <p> A few months before , in India , we did n't  have that same warning and took a very similar trip around Banglore . And we also avoided a Rickshaw/hotel scam in Puna . <p> Anyway , thanks for sharing.cuz you know someone is getting fed that line right now outside the palace . <p> that 's funny . It goes to show that you really need to have your mind on the game at all times . at the grand palace I even had people dressed as " tourist police " trying to tell me that it does n't  open until 1pm so I should go to some other places . the grand palace is open all day ! thanks Greg . <p> Ive been the victim of that exact same scam too . For 20 baht i did n't  feel too hard done by though , on reflection I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our driver did n't  sound as nice as yours though . When my friend and I point blank refused to go to our 3rd suit/jewel shop in a row the driver just drove off and left us . It was pretty hard to work out where we were , but we eventually worked it out and found our way back to our hostel . <p> Yeah I think we were lucky with our driver . I could tell that he felt guilty for misleading us . That 's why he ended up just taking us back to our hotel . I was kind of expecting that he might just drive off and leave us there , like what happened to you . I agree though , it turned out to be a pretty good ( and cheap ) day out ! Cheers Neil . <p> This scam can get a bit tiresome . I remember one place they took us , an Indian tailor quite a long way from anywhere . The tuk tuk guy disappeared for 20 minutes and the guy in the shop literally did not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other junk he was selling . <p> Ok , it may not be junk , but I would refuse on principle to buy anything from the shops who encourage this stupidity . <p> In the end I pushed past him , as he was standing in the door way blocking my exit , and got a meter taxi . <p> I agree it does start to get quite annoying , mainly because you did n't  actually want to go there in the first place . I 'm lucky that my tuk tuk driver stayed right outside , I think if he had left like yours then I would have done the same thing and grabbed a taxi . Cheers ! Dean Wickham recently posted .. Visiting the Doges Palace in Venice , Italy <p> Hey Shaun . I have had a few people say something similar , and I guess maybe I used the wrong term to describe my situation . The main thing to note is that it is something that you need to watch out for , as although my day turned out to be fine and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , many people are n't  so lucky . I have heard from people who have been taken to these places and threatened until they buy something , while others have simply been left in the middle of no where because they refused to buy anything . Maybe scam is n't the right word to use , but you certainly get lied to and put in potentially dangerous situations . Not something you want while on holiday . CheersDean Wickham recently posted .. A Dream Come True : Trekking the Milford Track in New Zealand <p> Hi Dean , seems like you had a good day out for your 20 Baht and although you got a little frustrated towards the end when you were hot and tired you at least didn " t get left in the middle of nowhere . <p> Some of these scenarios can be really sophisticated with multiple people being involved . The problem with Bangkok is that you never know whether what you are being offered is genuine or along the lines of your experience . <p> For example I got off the ferry from Koh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking if I needed a taxi . Immediately I have my scam guard up and actually I was heading to the bus station to go back to Ekkamai so I asked how much and he said 1400 Baht and pointed out the car over the road . <p> It was n't a standard taxi it was like a large sedan and fairly new . I asked two other people if they wanted to split a car back to Bangkok and they agreed so off we went and we got home in 1.5 hours instead of the 3 hours by bus and it only cost an extra 250 Baht . <p> On the way back to Bangkok the driver basically said that he had to pay the owner of the car 900 Baht for the return trip , so if he could get a passenger to cover that then he could keep the difference . <p> There are often great deals to be had in Bangkok , the trick is knowing which ones are on the level and which one are just going to waste your precious holiday . <p> Hi Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not all people are trying to rip you off . I found it very hard to differentiate between the two when I was there . Some people are that convincing . Cheers ! <p> Hi ! So funny to read this ! We are in Bangkok now and got scammed yesterday . I simply googled this to see what was going on and if other people had done the same thing ! We were walking down a big street with big picture of probably important people . I was curious and asked a local about them . He was so nice and asked about are day , the rest you know = In the middle of the ride we got out . But we had a nice and cheap tuk-tuk ride ! It felt like a scam , but as you mentioned , we had a fun hour in a tuk-tuk !

Weve been on the road for most of this year , and after three months of continuous travel in Southeast Asia , it has been great to just stay put here in Chiang Mai for a while . <p> After two months here , Ive come to know the city quite well . We 're staying right in the Old City , and I 've explored a lot of its streets and alleyways , seen lots of temples and eaten so much delicious food it 's not funny . <p> I just love Thai food , and Chiang Mai has some of the best that I 've tasted . Over the past two months we 've found a few favourite spots that we keep returning to , mainly in the North Eastern corner of the Old City as that is where we are staying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often find myself craving a certain dish from a certain restaurant or food stall . Here are six of my favourite restaurants to get cheap and tasty Thai food in Chiang Mai . <h> Barnakarn Kitchen <p> Chicken Panang Curry at Barnakarn Kitchen <p> This little restaurant opens around sunset on Moon Muang ( the moat road in the Old City ) just north of Sompet Market , between Soi 6 and Soi 7 . From their food cart they cook up some absolutely amazing traditional Thai dishes . A couple of my favourites here include Crispy Pork with fried greens and rice , a spicy Panang Curry and Pad Krapow Moo ( minced pork with chilli and basil ) . Most dishes also have a tofu option for vegetarians . They have an inside seating area or you can sit out on the street on fine nights . Most dishes cost 40-50 Baht . <h> Aroy Dee <p> Fried Rice at Aroy Dee <p> One of our all time favourites and a place that we have to eat at a couple of times each week , Aroy Dee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious noodles and fried rice that I 've ever had in Thailand . They have a small menu consisting of only four dishes , but they cook them all to absolute perfection . I usually find myself ordering fried rice or Pad See Ew ( fried big noodles ) , but all dishes are amazing . They cook from a food cart and have a small indoor eating area . The people who run Aroy Dee are all very lovely and friendly and recognize us whenever we walk in . All dishes here cost 40 Baht and include a bowl of soup broth . Each dish has the option of chicken , pork , shrimp or tofu . <p> Aroy Dee opens in the late afternoon and is located on Moon Muang ( the moat road ) just south of Sompet Market . You 'll see the food cart with the amazing aromas coming from it and know that you 're in the right spot . There are only five tables , so you might have to wait a few minutes to get a seat . They also set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . <h> Isaan Ros Sab <p> Gravy Noodles and Mango Salad at Isaan Ros Sab <p> Another little local place situated on the corner of Rachapakinai Road and Soi 9 , Isaan Ros Sab serves up some very tasty Isaan cuisine , along with lots of other Thai dishes . They have some great salads here . Try their Som Tam Thai ( Thai salad ) , Tam Tua ( green bean salad ) and Tom Yam ( hot and sour soup ) . Most dishes are under 60 Baht . <h> Best Local Thai Restaurant <p> Yellow Curry at Best Local Thai Restaurant <p> Their name certainly makes a statement . Best Local Thai Restaurant is located on Soi 6 right next to Sompet Market you 'll see their blackboard sign out the front . Are they the best local Thai restaurant in Chiang Mai ? Well that 's probably impossible to know , but they could certainly be in the running . This place is a little pricier than the other restaurants in this article , but the food is very delicious . I really enjoy their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals cost about 60-80 Baht , but range up to 120 Baht for a Tom Yam soup . <h> Yok Fa <p> Ratna Pork Gravy Noodles at Yok Fa <p> Located on Rachapakinai Road south of Soi 6 , Yok Fa is a popular eatery with locals . I 've rarely seen other foreigners here , but they do have an English menu . Yok Fa seems to specialise in pork soup dishes , but they also do a pad see ew and mango salad . The dish that really draws me here is their ratna , a very tasty gravy noodle dish with pork . It consists of big noodles with pork and greens in a thick , mouth watering gravy sauce . Most dishes cost 40 Baht . <h> Morning Glory <p> Tofu Massaman Curry with brown rice at Morning Glory <p> If you 're a vegetarian , Morning Glory is a must if you 're in Chiang Mai . This tiny restaurant serves a wide range of vegetarian only Thai meals . I like to come here for something a little different as they cook traditional Thai dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Khao Soy , Massaman Curry and Glass Noodle Bake . Most dishes come with tofu and brown rice , and cost 50-60 Baht . <p> Morning Glory is located at the Eastern end of Ratwithi Road between Soi 2 and Rachapakinai Road . <p> There are a lot of amazing places to eat in Chiang Mai , and so many that I have yet to try , but these six places are a good start . If you love Thai food , you are going to love Chiang Mai !

I awoke at 6am to a softly lighted dawn view of the lake outside my window , the snow dusted mountains reflecting on the calm water . After a quick breakfast in the warm dining room of the teahouse , I braced myself for the cold and began walking out of the village . It looked to be a beautiful clear day and although it was freezing , the walking helped to warm me up a little . At the edge of the village I crossed the stream that feeds all of the lakes in Gokyo and eventually becomes the Dudh Kosi . On the other side of the stream Gokyo Ri rises up immediately , and from here there is nothing but climbing . <p> The view from my window in Gokyo <p> At this altitude , climbing is a real killer and I felt ridiculously exhausted within a few minutes of trekking up the steep slope . There was a maze of zigzagging trails that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none seemed to be much better than the other , so I went where my feet took me . The altitude made it feel like I was wearing lead boots , and taking each step was exhausting . I had to make sure to set a slow and controlled pace , and it became a game of placing one foot in front of the other , something that I knew well from other high altitude climbs I have done . It is a game of the mind as much as it is for the body . If I thought about the whole mountain in general , it seemed impossible , but if I broke it down into smaller pieces , and aimed to get to the next rock or the next turn in the trail , or even just the next step , I knew I was making progress . And if I could keep doing that , then eventually I would be at the top . <p> I stopped often , not just from the exhaustion , but also because it was worth stopping to look around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathtaking .

There was no break in the climb . It was relentless and grueling and at times it seemed that I was no closer to the top , although I knew that each step took me closer . <p> In the end I made the summit in just over two hours .

By the third day of exploring the city I had come to see how much the French had influenced the architecture and culture . Although the city seems to be trying to develop into a modern capitol , some of the older buildings have kept that French colonial style , sometimes mixed with Lao architecture . One great example of this is Patuxai . <p> Built between 1957 and 1968 , Patuxai was constructed as a war monument in dedication to those that fought for Laos independence .

Getting close to the arch I could also make out some of the details , where I could see the Lao style come into the design .

Both times that I have been to Nepal I visited in November/early December and the weather was beautiful . Generally , the best trekking times are from March to early May , and then October to early December . You can also trek through the winter months at lower altitudes but the higher mountain passes get closed off.Dean Wickham recently posted .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Nepal last November during the fuel crisis .

There are a lot of buskers in Italy , nearly every city and town that I went through had someone playing an instrument or doing some other type of interesting performance . One that I noticed more than others though were these street performers that dress up like statues , staying perfectly still for hours , only moving when someone puts a coin in their tin . I cant imagine the patience that it must take to stay completely still for that long , and also be able to stay in their costumes in the heat of the day . <p> Here are some photos of some of the street performers that I came across in Italy .

It is something that I preach often when you travel to a new place , go there with an open mind . Try not to judge a place before you go there . But even I have trouble with this sometimes . Sometimes , you just ca n't help having some sort of expectation of a place before you visit . For me , I have this problem the most when it comes to popular tourist attractions . A lot of people go to these places with high expectations , but for me , I always kind of expect to be disappointed . Sometimes this turns out to be true , but quite often this works out in my favour , because I end up being pleasantly surprised by the place .

In fact , I 've probably spent the good part of a year of my life over there . In Southeast Asia , so far I have visited five countries well , six including Singapore and I thought that I would challenge myself to picking a favourite place in each of those five countries . This was a far harder challenge than I imagined . There are so many places that bring back amazing memories , and I keep thinking to change my choices , but here they are : <h> Hoi An , Vietnam <p> Waterfront street at dusk in Hoi An <p> I fell in love with Hoi An almost instantly as I took my first walk through the Old Town . Its history , its atmosphere and its beautiful setting just captured me . I remember nights just walking through the lantern lit streets with my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cycling out to the beach during the day . Ill definitely keep coming back to Hoi An when I visit Vietnam . <h> Kratie , Cambodia <p> Sunset on the Mekong in Kratie <p> I loved every single second that I spent in Cambodia . There was n't a place that I visited that I did n't  like , and choosing a favourite place was very difficult . Kratie is a small town , situated on the Mekong River in the Northeast of the country , and foreigners who venture here come to see the rare Irrawaddy Dolphins that inhabit a stretch of the river just north of town , but for me the town had so much more than that . It had a truly sleepy and laid back vibe , and stepping just outside of town puts you right in the middle of rural Cambodia .

I was sure that I would choose Luang Prabang , one of my favourite cities in the world . The partying backpacker haven of Vang Vieng hardly sounds like the sort of place that I would love ; however my mind goes back to Vang Vieng a lot , the reason being that there is so much more to Vang Vieng than partying , getting drunk and tubing down a river , which is what seems to label the town a lot of the time . For me , Vang Vieng is all about cycling through the beautiful countryside surrounded by bright green rice fields with tall limestone karst mountains towering over them , and in the evening relaxing in a laid back restaurant or bar overlooking the river .

It is just one of those places that I needed to forget about sightseeing and travelling , and instead just live , mingle with the locals and do everyday things . I discovered a city full of life and friendly faces . I just loved how I could walk down a busy road where I felt like I was in the middle of a big busy city , and then just step down a quiet alleyway and feel like I was in a small country town .

George Town , on the island of Penang , was the first place that I visited in the country and I loved every minute of my time there . The mix of culture is incredible and the atmosphere addictive . Then , there is the food some of the best that I have had during my travels . I think , perhaps , that my stomach may even be making this choice for me .

As I can hardly ever get any sleep on planes , I arrived in the early afternoon feeling a bit like a zombie . Tribhuvan Airport gives a good first impression of Nepals poor economy , especially in comparison with Changi Airport in Singapore .

That is what you can find on Rottnest Island for three seasons of the year . <p> Ricey Beach on Rottnest Island <p> Located just off the coast of Fremantle in Western Australia , this beautiful island often makes you feel like you are somewhere in the Mediterranean . Although popular in the warmer months with locals and tourists alike , this is the sort of island where you can easily find yourself a secluded beach all to yourself at almost any time of the year . <p> I 've visited Rottnest Island many times in my life , and during my last visit with my wife and brother-in-law I had memories flooding back of school excursions and family trips to the island . It is still just as exciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid . We took a day trip to the island , taking the ferry from Fremantle and renting bikes on the island .

At the end of the day we sat and had a beer at Hotel Rottnest , looking out over Thompson Bay while awaiting the afternoon ferry . <p> If you travel to Perth in Western Australia , make sure to take a trip out to Rottnest Island . It is simply stunning . If you are n't  sure , I 'm here to change your mind with these photos from my last trip to the island . There really is no other place like " Rotto " = <p> The road that runs around the island , mostly used by cyclists .

Rottnest is Dutch for " rats nest " which is what the early Dutch explorers mistook them for . I suppose they kind of do look like a rat crossed with a wallaby . They certainly are very cute , and totally unique to the island . <p> The view towards Salmon Bay from Wadjemup Lighthouse <p> The beach and view to Green Island <p> More quokkas that found napping in the shade of a tree near Green Island .

There is also another ferry company ( Rottnest Fast Ferries ) that runs between Rottnest and Hillarys . The return ticket from Fremantle costs $77 , although if you book in advance you can sometimes find promo deals . <p> Two other options to get to Rottnest are to fly ( yes there is an airstrip on the island ) or , if you 're lucky enough to own your own boat , you can take yourself to the island . <h> Getting around Rottnest Island <p> In my opinion the absolute best way to get around Rottnest Island is cycling . The island is small enough to cycle all of the way around , and the main road is sealed . Cycling allows you the freedom to go where ever you like on the island and discover those secluded little coves and beaches . You can rent bikes on the island for $30 per day , or you can take your own bike over on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bus service that goes around the island stopping at the major spots .

The train tickets cost $10 . <h> Rottnest Island Accommodation <p> If you want to spend a few days on Rotto , there are plenty of accommodation options from camping and hostel accommodation to self contained cottages and bungalows . You can even have a luxurious water view . It is n't cheap to stay on Rottnest , but that 's the price you pay for staying on an island paradise . Prices start from $36 per person per night for a campsite . <p> Such an awesome place ; cheers for the reminder that its just down the road and I need to visit again !

The West side of the Southern Alps has two magnificent and easily accessible glaciers , Fox and Franz Joseph Glaciers . Coming from Queenstown I arrived at the small town of Fox Glacier and set up camp by around lunchtime . This gave me the afternoon to go and explore the glacier . <p> There are several ways to see the glacier depending on your budget and your sense of adventure . Being the adventurous type , I wanted to set foot on the glacier itself and chose to spend the money on a " Heli Hike " . A Heli Hike involves a scenic helicopter flight over the glacier , before landing on the glacier itself where you get to go on a guided hike on the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crampons and a walking pole , so all you have to bring is some warm and preferably waterproof clothing ( Yes ice is made out of water , so you can get wet if you fall over ) , a bottle of water , snacks and most importantly your camera . <p> The flight over the glacier is spectacular , and though the weather was n't great when I was there , I still had excellent views . After circling over the glacier for a while the pilot brought the helicopter down to land on the ice . As we got closer I could make out the group before us waiting to be picked up on the ice . This was a great way to see the scale of the glacier , with the people looking like ants on the huge river of ice . <p> People waiting to be picked up on the glacier <p> Once the helicopter had landed we got off and had to walk along the ice to a safe distance away from the chopper .

A glacier is of course a river of ice which is constantly moving and changing and is a dangerous place , full of crevasses and melting ice . Its very important to listen and follow your guides advice throughout the hike . <p> Listening to our guide <p> Walking on the ice is a little weird at first but it does n't  take long to get the hang of it . Following our guide we walked around the glacier for a few hours . Being on a glacier almost felt like being on another planet .

Tuk tuks are also readily available to take you anywhere in the city . Just remember to negotiate a price before you accept a ride .

Of those places in South East Asia , Laos stands out as one of the cheapest destinations , AND of those places in Laos , Nong Khiaw is one of the cheapest that I have come across . <p> I did n't  really know a lot about Nong Khiaw , all I had really seen about it was the amazing photos of a river surrounded in jungle , with huge limestone karsts surrounding it . That was enough for me to want to visit . <p> I left Luang Prabang in the morning in a minivan , along with a few like minded travellers . Right on Laos time , we departed around an hour after the scheduled time .

It was the wet season and evidence of landslides were common , though so far we had avoided being held up . This soon changed . We came to a section of road that had recently had a landslide fall across it . There was a gap that had been cleared in the huge pile of mud and rubble that cars could only just fit through . Though it was very boggy , slippery and the road base beneath it had collapsed on one side , our driver decided that he could get through , but that the van was too heavy . We all got out in the mud to walk to the other side while the van tried to get through . I was expecting to have to give the van a push , so getting covered in mud was inevitable .

Visiting this Masai village was a great experience for me , as the people showed us around their village and gave us a look into the lives and culture of the Masai people . Traditionally , to start a fire the Masai men get an ember happening using sticks before carefully placing the ember into the middle of some dry donkey dung . The dung is then nurtured as they blow air into it to get the dung to light up in a flame . Once the dung is lit it is placed onto a pile of sticks to create a proper fire . This is the way it has been done for hundreds of years , and still is today in many of the Masai villages .

The landscape is simply amazing and swimming in caves and waterfalls and riding on a bike with the wind in your face is a much better way to beat the heat than baking under the sun in a tube . <p> Its funny , I felt less claustrophobic when I was in a cave with water than a cave where I had plenty of room to walk .

@@83696491 @5196491/ <h> Budget Tips for a Road Trip Around Australia <p> Dean WickhamMarch 7 , 2015 <p> Australia is without a doubt one of the most diverse and interesting countries to visit in the world . There is a lot to see , from interesting cities to amazing natural wonders , but it is also an expensive place to travel . One of the best ways to see it ( and one of the cheapest ) is to hit the road and drive yourself around the country . I 've spent quite a lot of time road tripping across Australia in my old van , and there is still so much more that I am yet to see , but I have picked up quite a few tips along the way . It can be a bit confusing coming from another country and working out how to do things , so these tips should help to get you on your way . <p> Road trip through the South Flinders Ranges in South Australia <h> Buying a vehicle <p> If you 're only travelling for a couple of weeks , then hiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on spending months or even a year travelling around the country , hiring a car just is n't really financially feasible . The cheapest and best way to see the country is to buy a used car and then sell it again when you 're done . Lots of travellers and backpackers do this and you just need to know the rules and regulations . <p> Buying a car in Australia is easy . You can just head to a car yard or look in the classifieds in the paper , but one of the best places to find a car or van is on Gumtree . This is where I bought my old van , and a lot of backpackers buy and sell their camper vans there as well . Gumtree is a huge marketplace where you can buy and sell pretty much anything , and their automotive section is excellent . You can search by car type and there are some pretty decent used car prices . <p> When buying a vehicle privately in Australia for example if you were to buy a van from some other backpackers you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying in . Most states require that the vehicle will be sold with a roadworthy certificate , which is necessary for registration . Here in Queensland you should make sure that the person you are buying from provides this , as well as a registration transfer form that you can lodge at the transport department . Each state has different laws and regulations and you should look up the transport department for the state that you are buying in . <p> Unless you know the person well , it is also a good idea to get the vehicle checked out by a mechanic before you purchase it to make sure that it is a good buy and that it is n't going to fall apart on you half way around Australia . <p> When you register your vehicle , it will come with CTP ( Compulsory Third Party ) Insurance . This is not the same as liability insurance , and is there to cover emergency medical assistance etc , in case of an accident . Comprehensive car insurance can be a little pricey , but you should at least get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle in case of an at fault accident . This is quite affordable and a good idea since you are driving in a foreign country . <p> The Twelve Apostles on the Great Ocean Road just one of so many beautiful drives in Australia <h> Staying safe on the road <p> I often refer to Australia as the land of rules and regulations . It is almost ridiculous how many rules we have here , and the same applies to the road . It is a good idea to read up on the Australian road rules before you start driving as they probably differ quite a lot to your country . For example , the top speed that you can do on any road in Australia is 110kph , where as there may not be a speed limit on the motorways in your own country . In urban areas this speed drops down to 50kph unless otherwise stated . There are plenty of other rules as well and the fines will take a big chunk out of your travel budget . <p> Australia is a huge country and much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for long drives between places . Make sure that your vehicle is in top condition before you start driving around the country , carry a jerrycan full of emergency fuel at all times , and make sure you have a proper spare tyre and the tools to change it . <p> Camping in our van = free . The view = priceless <h> Budget tips <p> One word you could use to describe travel in Australia is EXPENSIVE . Things do cost a lot here , but there are ways to keep your spending to a minimum . There is no way to avoid the huge cost of fuel , but you can save money on accommodation and food . One of the benefits of having a van is that you can pretty much pull up anywhere and sleep for the night . Australia is full of camp grounds and many of them are free or only cost a few dollars . Obviously , if you want the comfort of a caravan park then you will be spending a lot more . It can cost anywhere from $20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Carry a gas stove with you as well as an esky ( ice box ) and some cooking utensils and you can buy food at the supermarket and cook all of your own meals . If you just have a normal car you can still do this . Just buy a tent and some camping gear . You will save a lot of money doing it this way . <p> I decked my old van out with a proper bed and a kitchen in the back , so I can just pull up where ever I like , cook myself a meal and get a good nights sleep . I also have things like a canopy for shade and protection from the rain , a table and chairs for sitting outside and a solar shower and shower tent . I lived like this for about five months straight and couldnt be happier . <p> Camping at Rainbow Beach in Queensland <h> When to travel <p> Being such a large country , Australia has a lot of different climates and weather patterns . Generally speaking , you should travel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia during the Winter . The reason I say this is because the North is tropical and is hot , humid and very wet during the Summer months , which can result in flooding and even the odd cyclone . The South is also hot in the Summer , but mostly fine . In the Winter it can get very cold and wet , and we even get snow up in the mountains of New South Wales , Victoria and Tasmania . Winter in the North is n't cold at all and the weather is usually beautiful . <p> A road trip around Australia will be one of the greatest things that you will do . It is such a beautiful country , and the freedom of just being on the road is addictive . I hope that these tips help you with planning your trip .

San Marco is the area where you will find the largest crowds as it has a lot of the major tourist attractions of Venice , most notable of which is Piazza San Marco and St Marks Basilica . The large crowds of tourists attracts a large number of Gondoliers who offer romantic gondola rides up and down the picturesque canals . Some of these canals can become quite a traffic jam when a few gondolas and boats get in the one place . As a passerby it can be an interesting sight .

The rocky limestone coast of the island is often broken up by picturesque coves and perfect white sand beaches . The crystal clear blue water is usually a very pleasant temperature for swimming .

Ayutthaya was a thriving city that was destroyed by the Burmese army in the 18th century , and what is left now is a whole lot of interesting ruins that date back hundreds of years . Although the modern town of Ayutthaya is built amongst it , exploring the ruins of the ancient city make for an interesting way to spend a day , and you can easily visit as a day trip from Bangkok by taking the 2 hour train ride with the locals .

You should definitely spend at least a few days here to really experience the city . <h> Things to do in Hanoi <p> Just wandering around the Old Quarter is enough to keep you busy for hours . Grab a Bia Hoi ( draught beer ) or a Ca Phe Den ( Vietnamese coffee ) at one of the local corner bars or cafes and watch life go by . There are lots of specific sights to see as well : <p> Hoan Kiem Lake &amp; Ngoc Son Temple <p> In the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where local couples come to sit by the lake at all times of the day .

The temple dates back to the 18th century and it contains an enormous embalmed turtle that came from the lake . Apparently there is also a 200kg turtle that still lives in the lake and can sometimes be seen from the temple . It costs 20,000 Dong ( $1 ) to enter the temple . <p> Hoan Kiem Lake is especially beautiful at night when it is all lit up . <p> View to Ngoc Son Temple at Hoan Kiem Lake <p> Dong Xuan Night Market <p> I love markets so I was excited when I found out that Hanoi has one right in the centre of the Old Quarter .

Remember to be respectful and wear appropriate clothing . <p> Bach Ma Temple <p> Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum <p> We did n't actually get to visit here as we were there at the wrong time , but it is worth mentioning .

They serve up Bun ( rice noodle soup ) with meat . I had Bun Bo ( beef ) and Veronika had Bun Ca ( fish ) . They do n't speak any English here but just point at the names on the board and you can get by ok . <p> This is a tiny coffee shop on Au Trieu that serves really nice local coffee .

Masjid Negara was built in 1965 as the official mosque of Malaysia and can hold up to 15,000 people at a time . Outside of the main prayer times , tourists are allowed to visit the mosque as long as they are dressed appropriately ( robes are provided if you do n't  have the appropriate clothing ) . There are lots of sights to check out , but for me the most impressive part of the mosque is its main prayer hall , situated right in the centre under the huge star shaped roof .

Before me is a scene out of a National Geographic magazine . Perfectly flat green rice fields stretch out in front of me until they reach the sheer cliffs of the tall limestone karst mountains that tower over them . Its a cloudy day , but the dark grey rain clouds that hug the mountains only add to the dramatic effect of the scene . Its rice planting season in Laos and the farmers and rice field workers are out in the fields , ankle deep in muddy water busily planting the seedlings in an almost perfect pattern . It looks like back breaking work , spending all day bent over like that , all for the most meagre pay that you can think of . Still , this is life here in the rural countryside around Vang Vieng , and I 'm smiling because I 'm receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopping back on our bikes , Veronika and I keep peddling along the rocky dirt road .

I remember one who ran beside me laughing as he raced me down the road , almost beating me despite me being on a bicycle while he was on foot . I love that being back in this place only brings back happy memories , and I wonder if it is all still going to be the same . <p> Following the dirt road through the countryside in Vang Vieng <p> As we cycle through the village , those smiling and laughing children are no longer there , though I do notice houses and shops that I remember passing last time .

I 'm flying by the time I reach the bottom but have to suddenly slam my breaks on , my back tyre skidding along the loose gravel on the road . A young girl has run out on the road in front of me smiling and waving . Her house is a bamboo hut on the side of the road , sitting above some rice fields where I can see people , probably her family , busily planting rice .
