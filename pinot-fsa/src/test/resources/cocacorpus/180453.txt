@@22940594 @2940594/ <h> The Future of Pharma Packaging Looks Smart <p> The technologies that make up smart packaging have the potential to deliver significant value to businesses and consumers alike . <p> For example a 2015 report estimated the global smart packaging market will hit $39.7 billion by 2020 , indicating that smart packaging appears to be on the brink of a breakthrough . However , the uptake and use of smart packaging to date has n't been universal . Some sectors are grappling with issues around feasibility , cost and consumer demand , but pharmaceuticals represent one sector that looks likely to harness the value and capabilities of smart packaging . <p> Smart packaging has become somewhat of a catch-all phrase . What does it include ? Smart packaging can be broken down into intelligent and active packaging .

All the while , packaging has to reflect , support , and communicate these changes . <p> Looking ahead , the pharmaceutical market is expected to experience above-average growth , aided by the commercialization of sophisticated biotechnology-based drugs , which tend to be costly . Also , the increased prevalence of drugs with high moisture sensitivity will boost demand for moisture control packaging . The need for packaging that can provide reminders becomes increasingly valuable as populations age and more of people require medicine and drugs on a regular basis . <p> The costs may remain prohibitive for many healthcare providers , especially in emerging economies , but smart packaging is already playing an important role in offering patients , pharmacists , and healthcare professionals valuable information about expiration dates , composition , and dosages .

@@22940627 @2940627/ 15139 @qwx215139 <h> Inspection of glass containers <p> For generations , the debate raged over whether glass was a liquid or a solid . And because glass does n't molecularly abide by the rules of either of those states of matter , some have given up on liquid or solid and define glass as a supercooled liquid . More recently , glass has come to be defined as an amorphous solid . Let physicists continue to debate . From a packaging perspective , glass might not be supercooled , but it definitely is super cool . <p> No other single packaging material duplicates all of the advantages of glass : clarity ( in addition to coming in a variety of colors ) ; inert ; impermeable to moisture and gases ; odorless ; capable of being formed into a variety of shapes ; solid and reassuring to the touch ; microwavable ; reusable ; and recyclable . The combination imparts a premium image to a wide variety of branded products . Additionally , there 's a trend wherein products that once were packaged in glass but converted to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going " retro " with limited edition launches packaged in glass . <p> As to disadvantages , glass is relatively expensive , in the sense of purchase price . Glass also is relatively heavy , which translates to higher transportation costs . The most limiting disadvantage of glass , of course , is its fragility : it chips , cracks , breaks , and shatters . The disadvantages are interrelated ; for example , source reduction ( more practical for single-use containers than for multi-use ones ) can reduce purchase price and transportation costs but can increase fragility ( although container design and material distribution can offset , to a degree ) . - Ideally , glass containers come into existence pristine , a condition best for tilting the scale in favor of glass ' advantages over its disadvantages . In reality , however , glass goes through figurative hell , given the temperatures of the furnace , and the stresses from molding the container and from annealing are in no way heavenly , either . So it is that glass containers can embody a variety of defects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sequential stages of glass container manufacturing ( batch house , hot end , and cold end ) . And since the cold end deals with the container 's suitability to be shipped ( or first labeled , if that 's done at the facility ) , QA at that stage is synonymous with inspecting for defects . <p> Calling em like you see em <p> While in a self-defining sense defects are imperfections , they are more formally categorized as follows : critical , major , and minor . And although the lines of demarcation are n't always distinct , the categories correspond to defects that , respectively : make the container unfit for its purpose ; considerably impair the container 's fitness ; and , are mostly of a blemish character . Furthermore , there 's a nomenclature , some of it requiring no translation , such as cracks , blisters , and dirt , while some of it does , such as plugs , bird swings , and rocker bottoms . <p> Every glass container should undergo inspection . The issue is how that inspection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , the naked eye and the electronic eye . Humans can be utilized to make visual inspections of statistically-determined quantities of containers . Laboratory measurements of the container 's dimension 's and relevant properties are another realm wherein humans can be utilized . Automated inspection , in complement , has capabilities that are most suited for high-output operations . Such inspection can reject defective containers ( turning them into cullet to be recycled into the manufacturing process ) ; moreover , computerization maintains real-time statistics that can be fed upstream to correct a problem , for example , a specific mold that 's turning out an unacceptable quantity of defective containers. - - The ever-present challenge to successful inspection is that defects can occur anywhere in the container ; a bottle , for example , is subject to specific defects from top to bottom relative to its finish , neck , shoulder , body , and base . In acknowledgement , a glass manufacturing facility utilizes different inspection stations equipped with machinery of a dedicated purpose . One typically positioned at the front of the cold end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances of glass-to-glass contact . In that capacity , it 's as much a defect preventer as a defect detector. - From the user 's perspective- - - - A user should have knowledge of glass inspection , not necessarily as much as that of a glass supplier , but certainly enough to evaluate a supplier 's fitness in that category . The user 's objective should be a relationship with a supplier wherein shipments are certified as having passed a comprehensive inspection process . That being the case , the user should be able to feed the containers into packaging line operations , confident that those containers embody the requisite quality . <p> Knowledge of inspection and of defects serves the user in the drafting of the document that 's at the heart of the user/supplier relationship : the specification . Tolerances should n't be unreasonably tight ; nonetheless , they should reflect state-of-the-art capabilities . <p> Another aspect of inspection concerns defects encountered after the container has been filled and sent into the supply chain . The user sometimes has to send someone out into the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , an investigator 's " forensic " talents become almost CSI-like . Take , for example , the susceptibility of glass to stress fractures . The veteran investigator can distinguish , by the pattern , between fractures caused by internal pressure and fractures caused by external impact . And even when a container has been reduced to fragments , the fragments can reveal whether the stress occurred all at once or more slowly . <p> Glass protects , but it requires protection . However , the fewer the defects and the less their severity , the more a glass container can provide its many advantages . An inspection process that does the job benefits both supplier and user . It benefits consumers , too , from the standpoints of product quality and personal safety ( after all , broken glass is sharp ) . - And when all parties end up winners , that 's a situation that 's super cool .

@@22940686 @2940686/ <p> " Packaging supply chain efficiency is a mix of engineering , material science , standardization and logistics , " Sriman Banjeree , head of packaging development for GlaxoSmithKline , Parsipanny , NJ. , presented 10 packaging factors as they relate to manufacturing and supply chain efficiency . The points he made at Pack Expo 2012 go beyond the usual supply chain bullets ; in addition to being an IoPP Certified Packaging Professional , Banjeree is a mechanical engineer with post graduate studies in packaging , holds a Master 's degree in financial management . <p> 1 . Building new packaging design deficiencies in supply chain : Design to value : Whether you are improving an existing package or designing a new one , consider best practices from industries such as automobile and consumer electronics to design a package based on the best consumer insight and requirements . Consumer insights can drive tear-down and benchmarking and analysis of pack functions to enhance improve efficiency and reduce cost of goods . <p> Banjeree pointed to the example of a bag-in-container package that was redesigned to a direct-fill rigid container . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary package for savings beyond materials , including greater transportation and retail shelf space savings--more units fit in the same space . <p> 2 . Packaging components manufacturing strategy : Taking advantage of " volumes of scale typically play a dry important role in bringing down your cost of goods , " he says , pointing to the use of cube mold technology , which has offered many products greater economies of scale , faster cycle times , reduced manufacturing steps and transportation benefits . Reducing steps " leads to not only more time to manufacture ; it leads to wastefulness , it can create bottlenecks , and all this definitely has an effect on your efficiency , " said Banjeree . <p> Process selection is also is important ; consider your options . While injection molding and compression injection molding can " give you the same result , " Banjeree said , " each of them have their own pros and cons . " Be willing to question past assumptions . <p> 3 . Packaging procurement efficiencies : How do you source components ? Consider how to streamline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component to how you source and standardize raw materials . If your company is global , you 'll likely benefit from suppliers who also have a global footprint , and efficient supply chains . But if you have five or six suppliers serving your markets with good , targeted efficiency , this can also be the best option . Treat inventory management and working capital as important requirements in sourcing materials and components . <p> 4 . Manufacturing online efficiencies and strategy : Standardize package sizes that can be used for multiple products ; Banjeree noted one company that reduced nine separate blister packs to three , which greatly streamlined purchasing and overall manufacturing planning ; reduced change-over times , and produced higher line utilization . Machines could then be standardized as well . Likewise , three diameters of bottles , or sizes of cartons can produce other benefits . Other tips include optimizing pack layout for higher throughput , and apply Kaizen , and other Lean manufacturing-related tools for continued improvements . <p> 5 . Packaging optimization : Design considerations in packaging include the ability to choose and optimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a container can produce changes almost imperceptible to consumers ' eyes , while providing significant weight and size reduction benefits across the supply chain . This applies to new packages as well as reverse engineering on existing packages . The keys are to poly design features to reduce weight ; include the package 's aspect ratio during your design and retain skilled personnel who understand material sciences . " Computer simulation , " Banjeree said , " is going to be very important going forward . " Finite element analysis will be one particularly relevant tool . <p> 6 . De-bottlenecking solutions to increase line speed : Identify bottlenecks on your production line at every step , including labeling ; leaflet insertion ; sizing ; end-of-line processes and , as cited above , packaging material choices . Consider de-bottlenecking , also , by rethinking your conveyors , including factors such as modifying conveyor length or using multi-lane or helical conveyors . On the latter , Banjeree cited the use of longer or helical conveyors as a factor in reducing space and increasing line efficiency . <p> 7 . End-of-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a lot about efficiency , " said Banjeree , adding that " while you can speed-up upstream operations , you ca n't do anything " to increase line productivity if your end-of-line operations limit your capacity . Options for overcoming constrains include hand packing , case forming and semi-automatic case tapers and full automation of case erectors , case packers , case taping and stretch wrapping . <p> 8 . Sustainability in supply-chain : Trends favor the use of recyclable materials , more energy efficient machines to reduce carbon footprint and lightweighting . Bajeree also advised packaging professionals to look not just at using materials from today 's sustainable sources but to " ooh to the future " to find emerging solutions . To reduce energy use , use materials where possible that require lower manufacturing temperatures . <p> 9 . SKU rationalization and portfolio management : Banjeree cited the " 20/80 rule " in which " 20% of business delivers 80% of profits . " This can apply to 20% of efforts relating to of development and design driving 80% of the benefits . One example he cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited the label for Corega brand denture-cleaning paste ( see photo above ) , which used a multilingual pack to reduce complexity with packaging suppliers as well as in the plant , where changeovers once took a 20% toll on line productivity . <p> 10 . Warehouse management and transport efficiency : Tips include the use of standard and reusable pallets , use of floor space as well as height , adherence to first-in/first-out practices and understanding that the shortest distance in miles may not be there most efficient distance to route vehicles . Globally , Banjeree cited trends to watch in Asia ( flexible laminates and sachets ) ; Africa ( cartons using recycled board ) ; North America ( concentrates and smaller-size packs ) and Northern Europe ( recyclable packaging ) . <p> Continued , future considerations include late-stage customization ; increased application of digital technologies ; advanced robotics and other flexibility-enhancing automation solutions ; greater application of information technology to packaging efforts ; more sustainable designs and the use of intelligent materials . -

@@22940741 @2940741/ <p> Packaging professionals have had a lot to worry about in recent months . Rising raw materials costs have been high on the list of concerns . While packaging adhesives may be seen as secondary raw materials to the industry , many of the factors driving adhesives prices higher are also affecting primary packaging raw materials , like resins , films and bottles . Understanding the forces behind the recent cost inflation can help packaging professionals better prepare for the challenges of potential supply disruptions and certain rising costs that lie ahead . <p> Rising crude , declining gas <p> Crude oil powers the world . It is one of the most important cost drivers for both the packaging and adhesives industries . It not only influences the cost of many critical raw materials derived from crude , but rising crude prices pack a double punch by also inflating transportation and manufacturing costs . <p> Crude prices hovered between $70 and $80 per barrel for most of 2010 . Prices moved higher last fall as a wave of unrest flowed through the Middle East and North Africa . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per barrel . <p> While oil has climbed , the discovery of abundant new reserves of natural gas " what some are calling the " shale gas revolution " " has driven down the price of natural gas . There 's no doubt that shale gas , or the promise of its abundant , low-cost reserves , is improving the fate of the North American petrochemical industry , which uses both crude and gas as feedstocks for chemicals . But it may come at a cost to downstream industries , including adhesives , inks and packaging . <p> The problem is that the divergence in crude oil and natural gas prices is having a profound effect on the economics of North America 's olefins crackers " the source of many of the raw materials used in packaging . All forms of polyethylene and polypropylene resins and films , polypropylene and PET bottles , hot melt packaging adhesives and packaging inks are affected . <p> That 's because most North American crackers are flexible , which means they can run on a spectrum of feeds ranging from naphtha derived from crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before 2006 , crackers only flexed , or varied , their feed by about 10% to 30% depending on feed costs , according to Tom Brewer , T.A . Brewer Consulting , Inc . By 2009 , they could flex up to 70% . Today , cracker operators continue to retool plants , pushing them to accept greater volumes of lighter feeds . <p> The choice of feed makes a big difference to cracker margins . Lighter feeds often make much better economic sense . All of this is excellent news if companies require ethylene and its derivatives . Supply and cost problems for the packaging industry arise from the fact that as cracker feeds get lighter , fewer co-products result . That means much lower volumes of propylene and other important molecules are available for the production of raw materials for the packaging industry . <p> Competing for propylene <p> The packaging industry is already experiencing the effect of greater competition for the reduced supply . Propylene supply has not kept pace with propylene demand growth in recent years and prices are rising in response to the tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of the recession and set a new record in May . The shale gas effect has helped to make North America the highest-cost regional producer , according to Chemical Market Associates , Inc . ( CMAI ) a leading chemical consulting firm based in Houston . <p> Polypropylene , used in packaging films , resins and bottles , accounts for 58% of domestic propylene use . But when propylene supply tightens , smaller , higher-margin markets bid up prices as the competition for available supply intensifies . This diverts propylene away from polypropylene producers who are often priced out of the market ; shortages can result . <p> This dynamic " tightening supply , aggressive competition , escalating prices " is becoming the norm rather than the exception , says Fran Brady , Purchasing Director for Hot Melt Raw Materials at Henkel Adhesives Technologies . " In a world where there 's tight capacity and frequent supply outages , volumes will go to those willing to pay the highest prices and suppliers begin to select which companies and markets they want to sell to , " Brady says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the primary reasons why their prices have to be increased . " Suppliers are , in effect , abandoning their least profitable markets and customers " a practice referred to as " bottom slicing . " <p> Packaging adhesives <p> This trend has become all too evident in a number of packaging hot melt raw material categories , including waxes and tackifiers , says Brady . It has especially affected the supply of ethylene vinyl acetate ( EVA ) , a key hot melt component , and driven prices relentlessly higher. - EVA is the cushy foam that makes the soles of athletic shoes so comfortable . EVA has also emerged as the encapsulant of choice for solar modules used in photovoltaic panels . <p> Shoe grade EVA is easier and cheaper to produce than the grades used for adhesives or solar panels . Most EVA plants can manufacture a range of products , starting with low-density polyethylene and progressing through ever-higher proportions of VA-content EVA . Cost increases with VA content so producers shift output on the basis of economics and demand to optimize their margins . Shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for EVA supply . Adhesives rarely win . <p> They 're certainly not winning now . As the world emerged from the recession , consumers started buying shoes again , demand rose and EVA producers shifted production to make more shoe-grade EVA at the expense of the EVA needed for adhesives . <p> The boom in the photovoltaic industry has n't helped . The kind of EVA used in solar panels is more costly to make than shoe-grade EVA , but it is sold into a much higher-margin industry. - Suppliers are capitalizing on the opportunity , abandoning adhesives-grade EVA and targeting production for photovoltaics . <p> All of this is making it increasingly difficult for adhesives formulators to supply the grade of EVA required to make packaging hot melt adhesives . Supply remains tight and there is no relief in sight from the upward spiral of prices . <p> The shift in cracking feeds is also threatening the supply of water-white hydrocarbon tackifiers used in hot melt adhesives for end-of-line packaging applications . Packaging customers rely on the light color , low odor and clean machining of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Along with reduced volumes of propylene , cracking lighter feeds also generates less pyrolysis gasoline ( pygas ) , the source of important compounds used in tackifiers . But the effect is exacerbated . Cracking ethane reduces not only the quantity but also the composition of the pygas stream , producing less of the compounds required for tackifiers . This means that tackifier producers must process higher volumes of raw materials to generate the molecules they need , injecting additional cost into the process. - As long as ethane remains the feed of choice for crackers , water-white tackifier supply will remain tight and prices will move higher. - <p> If that were n't enough , the demand for many products that rely on water-white-based hot melt adhesives is growing rapidly . Adhesives used to construct disposable diapers and sanitary napkins represent the largest market for water-white resins . High birth rates and an expanding Asian middle class with more disposable income , especially in India and China , are driving demand for diapers and other disposable hygiene products . In Western countries , an aging population is increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . <p> Limited supply and growing demand will continue to tighten the supply of water-white tackifiers in the near term and pressure the supply of these packaging adhesives . Prices , of course , can only move higher . <p> Outlook <p> There 's no doubt that the North American petrochemical landscape is changing . In recent months , a surprising number of major players have announced intentions to build new facilities to capitalize on the emerging domestic feedstock advantage " something that was almost unconceivable a few years ago . This will increase the volume of ethylene produced in North America . <p> Analysts ' forecasts for stable , affordable natural gas prices for years to come are behind many of the decisions . But they will also continue to motivate cracker operators to stay away from costlier inputs based on crude . <p> None of this bodes well for the supply of propylene and other important chemicals needed to formulate propylene-based packaging materials . The threat to the supply of packaging hot melt raw materials is especially serious . <p> " The raw materials situation is changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good old days , " says Henkel 's Brady . " I 'm focused on security of supply . Price is always a concern , of course , but it 's now almost completely overshadowed by worries about supply . " - Brady has a word of advice for packaging customers : " Partner with hot melt adhesives suppliers that have a proven track record of supply and a well established global network for the procurement of raw materials " it 's the only insurance available in the current market .

@@22940761 @2940761/ <h> Material handling equation as it relates to packaging <p> The Material Handling Equation is Material + Move = Method : consider the characteristics of the material , along with the characteristics of the move , in order to choose a method for moving the material . Although it will never be awarded a place alongside E=MC- , it holds its own when it comes to conciseness and breadth of application . <p> Packaging and material handling are two disciplines linked by the Unit Load Principle : the larger the unitized load the less the cost-per-item to move that load . The size of the unitized load is limited by the lift capacity of the material handling equipment , in addition to other practical constraints , some imposed by transportation and storage . - - The interrelationship between packaging and material handling extends beyond the Unit Load Principal , however , and by understanding and utilizing the Material Handling Equation a packaging professional can improve the efficiencies and costs of the material flows within a facility . Wait , are n't those the responsibilities of material handling engineers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the mindset should be one of teamwork rather than encroachment . Besides , overlap is inevitable , for within a facility , the flows among receiving , in-coming storage , production ( including the packaging line ) , out-going storage , and shipping are affected by the amounts and types of packaging . - - Despite the kinship , there is a fundamental distinction between packaging and material handing ; namely , packaging adds value , material handling does n't . Although packaging adds multiple values , one deserves special mention : possession value . Packaging allows the consumer to possess ( and use ) the product . In contrast , material handling adds no value ; the number of times that the product is handled does n't result in proportional increases in value , although costs unquestionably increase . - The cost factor can be put in perspective by noting that in the typical facility more than one-half of total production cost , one-third of direct labor cost , and at least one-third of indirect labor cost are attributable to material handling . It therefore follows that material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances in which the move proves unnecessary . Analysis is required in order to make either of those determinations and the analytical tool is the Material Handling Equation . <p> Material <p> The first question always should be , why move the material at all ? - If , indeed , the material needs to be moved , the next question is what is the material ? The type of material , whether powder , granular , liquid , bulk , discrete , etc. has to be taken into account , as does the involved quantities . Also to be considered are the characteristics of the material , its fragility , for example . <p> Move <p> Where is the material to be moved ? The layout of the facility has a strong influence on how direct a path between points a move can proceed . Backtracking should be avoided to the extent possible . The path need not be limited to floor level , either , for there are times when an overhead path makes the best sense . Thought also should be given to subsequent stops . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , only to be moved later ( unchanged ) to point B , the practicality of moving to B without having stopped at A ought to be evaluated . As for the type of move , two major categories are intermittent and continuous . - When the move is to be made matters because material should be where it 's needed at the time that it 's needed ; otherwise , operations are subject to disruptions , with concomitant losses in productivity . - - - Method <p> Now it comes down to how the move is to be made . There are two options : manual and mechanical , although some methods , such as a non-powered pallet jack , are a combination of both . Material handling equipment constitutes a wide variety of choices : trucks , conveyors , cranes , hoists , etc. with various sources of power and various levels of automation . That fact introduces considerations related to other areas such as ergonomics and investment . <p> Finally comes who is to make the move ; for , even in a supposed fully-automated operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oversees . The method , therefore , affects the level of training and the overall skill levels required of material handling employees . <p> Flows are increasing <p> Armed with an understanding of the Material Handling Equation , packaging professionals will never want for opportunities to apply it . They need but tour a facility with an attentive eye and a questioning mind . Plus , there 'll be those opportunities occasioned by projects that are directly related to packaging , for example , the installation of a new packaging line or the integration of a new piece of equipment into an existing packaging line . - And as it 's doing with practically all facility operations , sustainability is influencing material flows , adding to them . An example is the waste destined to be recycled . How the waste is collected , unitized , and sent out can benefit from the Materials Handling Equation , in general , and the Unit Load Principle , in particular . On a related note , product stewardship can further add to material flows , given its central theme of Extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to post-consumer management of the product and packaging . <p> The interdependence between packaging and material handling is reflected in the organization The National Institute of Packaging , Handling &amp; Logistics Engineers , although the focus is geared to heavy industry and government . There use to be a Society of Packaging and Handling Engineers that was more geared to the CPG industries ; however , it merged with the Packaging Institute to form the Institute of Packaging Professionals . No matter , there 's no denying that in the CPG industries , neither packaging nor material handling can be performed one to the exclusion of the other . <p> No , the Material Handling Equation is not the Theory of Relativity . In fact , it 's not theoretical , at all . Rather , its everyday practicality has been proven countless times over . And that 's an attribute that might have caused even Einstein himself no little envy .

Many of the tourists hail from Calgary , 300 miles away , so the economy of Invermere depends considerably on that of Calgary . <p> But one Invermere business , Quality Bakery , is using an unusual packaging technology to become less dependent on the local economy . Essentially a method of pasteurizing bread in its package , it offers a shelf life at ambient temperatures of up to six months . That means Quality can reach markets far removed from Invermere or Calgary . <p> " With an item I can sell outside of this local area , I distribute my risk and establish a better economic picture for the bakery , " says Peter Banga , owner of the 40-year-old bakery . <p> Although the bakery produces more than 40 kinds of bread , the one Banga had in mind for extended shelf life was a wheat-free bread that would interest health food stores , specialty grocers and bakeries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would meet the rising demand of health food fans , as well as those on restricted diets . After considerable time in the kitchen , Banga developed a product he felt worthy of marketing . Unfortunately , without an extended shelf life , Banga 's new marketing scheme was only half-baked . <p> So he investigated in-bag pasteurization , a method used commonly in Europe that offers a shelf life of 40 to 60 days . According to Banga , it 's a matter of baking , cooling , slicing and packaging the bread into a polypropylene bag . After it 's packaged and the bread is closed with a twist-tie , the bread is placed in a pasteurizing oven , which is set at 75-C . This oven heats slowly , says Banga . It 's kept at that temperature for 30 minutes and then the oven is turned off . Bread is left inside for six to eight hours . This kills spores that would later cause the bread to mold , he says . <p> Using this method , Banga achieved a shelf life of 40 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many loaves did n't make it that long and were lost to spoilage . One of the reasons was the twist-tie , which allowed oxygen to enter the package .

@@22940781 @2940781/ <p> Well-known in its headquarters city of Philadelphia and throughout most of the northeastern U.S. , Tasty Baking is now investing some $25 million over three years in a bid to nationally distribute its snack cakes . To accomplish that out of a single plant , productivity and efficiency had to be improved . That meant investing in automation for much of the packaging equipment at Tasty 's 82-year-old six-story factory in the City of Brotherly Love . <p> First in line for modernization was the sixth floor , where four ovens are dedicated to producing Krimpets and Junior cakes . In the past , these snacks were hand-fed into flowrappers . Cartoning was automated , but case packing was another manual operation . <p> In December , that changed dramatically . The firm gutted the entire floor and reassembled it with automatic equipment , including three bottom-loading case packers from Salwasser ( Reedley , CA ) . <p> " We looked at all the case packing equipment out there , " says director of production Tom Kenney . " We needed case packers that could flat-out run fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughput , but good product handling , machine durability and quick changeover . We had the highest level of confidence in the Salwasser technology . " <p> Salwasser 's bottom-loading case-packing systems accumulate and vertically load cartons into corrugated cases . Because the process is gentle it allows cartons of the fragile cakes baked by Tasty to be case packed efficiently yet with minimal product handling and damage . <p> Each Salwasser system at Tasty Baking also features a unique loading tube that actually shrouds the cartons of product and is lifted slightly into the empty case just before product is lifted into the case . This technology eliminates the problems associated with the edges of cartons catching on the edges of cases . " Salwasser 's carton shrouding system offers positive control , " explains plant superintendent Joe Carboy . " Reducing product jams , this system improves efficiencies . " <p> Automating the case-packing operation also brought tremendous benefits in the way people are deployed . <p> " We previously had six people case packing Krimpets and Juniors on the four packaging lines , " says Kenney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to redeploy four of these people to other parts of the plant . Now case packing is handled by only two operators . As we progress on our learning curve with this new technology , we 'd like to handle this operation with one person . " <p> Representative line <p> Upstream from the case packers , other key improvements were made on all four packaging lines that occupy the floor . Line 64 , dedicated to Junior cakes in a variety of flavors , provides a good illustration of what each modernized line looks like . <p> The Junior cakes leave the oven eight-across on a metal belt conveyor that takes them to a transfer conveyor leading to the packaging equipment . A row aligner , supplied by Delta Systems ( Rogers , AR ) , makes sure all eight cakes are lined up evenly . The aligner is simply a pneumatically driven plastic blade that comes up in the gap between two conveyor sections to stop the cakes for a split second . If one cake is lagging , it has a chance to catch up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cakes leaves the transfer conveyor and proceeds ahead to the first of two Delta Systems transpositor belts . These retractable belts are designed to stroke back quickly , like the table cloth being pulled from beneath the dishes , thus creating a gap through which all eight cakes drop onto a takeaway conveyor running at a right angle . The transpositor then strokes back to its home position so the next row of eight cakes is conveyed right over it to the second transpositor belt . It drops its eight cakes onto a second takeaway conveyor running parallel to the first . <p> The use of two transpositor belts makes it possible to feed two Delta Systems flowrappers from one oven discharge conveyor . Just ahead of each flowrapper is a smart-belt infeed system , also from Delta Systems , that consists of five conveyor segments each driven by its own servo motor . The system serves two important purposes . First , the differential speeds of its first two conveyor segments turns each cake 90- so that cakes are aligned end-to-end in a single file . Its remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect the location of each cake , signalling the system 's industrial PC to speed up or slow down individual belt conveyor sections as needed . In this way , each cake is properly aligned for placement into a flight of the flowrapper . <p> Longer shelf life <p> The Delta Systems flowrappers wrap each cake in a 85-ga film supplied by Mobil Chemical ( Pittsford , NY ) . The wrappers create a fin-seal bottom and heat-sealed front and back on each cake package . A photoeye from Sick ( Bloomington , MN ) looks for eye marks on the edge of the film to keep the printed wrap in register . <p> The 85Bicor-AXT film is a three-layer coextrusion with an acrylic coating on one side and a coating of polyvinylidene chloride for oxygen barrier on the other side . The core of the three-layer coextrusion is oriented polypropylene , which is sandwiched between what Mobil calls " adhesion-promoting layers . " <p> Since adopting this film just before the sixth-floor modernization , Tasty Baking was able to increase product shelf life from 10 to 21 days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal . <p> Emerging from the side-by-side flowrappers , the cakes are conveyed toward a continuous-motion cartoner , the Paragon Model 750 from MGS Machine ( Maple Grove , MN ) . Its function is to collect six wrapped cakes , three on top of three , in its infeed buckets , erect a carton blank , load all six cakes into the carton and close the carton . It does all this despite a relatively small footprint : 11'x3 ' 4 " , excluding the infeed conveyor . <p> " We really wanted a continuous-motion cartoner , " says Kenney . " It gives us a steady 50 cartons a minute . It 's capable of more , but that 's just where we are with it . " <p> Resembles a tank tread <p> The cartoner 's infeed buckets are mounted on a track whose motion resembles that of a tank tread . In other words , its 50 buckets move continuously forward in an eliptical path . Along that path , each bucket receives cakes , has cakes pushed from it and into a carton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another load of cakes . <p> According to Kenney , the cartoner design solves a number of problems . " The major innovation is in the way the cakes are assembled in that six-count configuration and then pushed into the cartons , " says Kenney . Carton board is 18-pt clay-coated newsback printed offset in two colors . <p> Two overhead sweeps , each fed by one upstream flowrapper , perform the task of sweeping cakes three at a time from two collating stations and into the cartoner 's infeed buckets . The second sweep , located a few feet downstream from the first , sweeps its three cakes on top of the first three . <p> Here 's how it works . As the third cake nears its collating station , a photocell signals the system 's PLC , which in turn signals an upstream gating system to gently close on the flow of cakes . Once the collating station receives its third cake , another photocell signals the servo motor of the overhead sweep to push the cakes out of the collating station , causing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate is released to allow more cakes to move forward into the collating station . Meanwhile , the cakes that have been swept into the infeed bucket are pushed by a barrel cam loader into an erected carton . Flaps are tucked and glued closed , and the finished carton is conveyed out . <p> Watching the overhead sweeps operate is like watching two miniature ferris wheels in action . But instead of holding passenger cars at the end of each spoke , these ferris wheels hold six flat paddles that sweep wrapped cakes from the collating station into infeed buckets at the command of the PLC . <p> According to Kenney , the size of a Junior Coffee Cake is not the same as that of a Junior Chocolate Cake , so carton sizes must change accordingly . Fortunately , he adds , the cartoner takes just 10 minutes to change , as Kevin Kennedy of MGS explains . <p> Drop-in components <p> " We gave the machine drop-in components , " says Kennedy . " Instead of adjusting individual plows and guides and the glue/tuck assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly and drop in another one . Tighten the handles and your changeover is done . " <p> Case packing is next . On Line 64 , it 's done 12 cartons/case and five cases/min on a single-infeed Salwasser machine , a Model R101/B-80 . Top speed of the case packer , notes Salwasser , is 12 cases/min . <p> Space constraints make overhead conveying the only practical way to transfer cartons of Junior cakes to the case packer . So overhead conveyors from FlexLink Systems ( Bethlehem , PA ) were installed for that purpose . <p> At the Salwasser case packer , as each case blank is indexed into position for opening , a set of two vacuum cups adheres to the flaps of the case . A blade is quickly inserted into the case , breaking the case scores and assisting in positive case opening . A third and larger vacuum cup adheres to the front of the blank and pulls the case open . <p> On one of the four packaging lines on the sixth floor , changeovers are frequent , so on that line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " In our experience with other equipment , taking an hour to change over is not unusual , " says Carboy . " But the Salwasser machines have PLC controls that allow varying package parameters to be preprogrammed into memory . The PLC automatically controls 95 percent of the changes that need to be made . It takes one operator about 10 minutes to complete a changeover . " <p> Tight squeeze <p> Fitting modern technology into Tasty Baking 's sixth floor was a challenge . Severe space constraints and the need to maximize production throughput were in conflict . When it was determined that Salwasser 's standard case packers would n't fit , Salwasser began the process of custom-engineering the machines to accommodate the available space . The case-feeding magazine , for instance , was repositioned , and the case transfer drive was modified as well , all in an effort to shrink the overall footprint . <p> " Salwasser worked with us , making joint manufacturing decisions with us to change their technology to meet our product goals and fit into our space , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , nearby is the Model R-122/B-80 with two independent infeeds . Two MGS cartoners feed this machine . The independent infeeds stack and index cartons onto a common load plate , permitting the case packer to run even if one of the cartoners stops . All three of the new Salwasser machines on the floor load cartons into RSCs and seal the cases closed with hot melt adhesive units from Nordson ( Duluth , GA ) . <p> Even though the plant modernization has a long way to go overall , having the sixth floor finished is obviously a big relief to all who worked on it . The new equipment has brought production capacity that makes national distribution a reality . <p> " From the time we shut down the operation to the time we restarted , it took 21 days , " says Kenney . " That includes gutting the entire floor , painting , cleaning , piping and wiring . " <p> That does n't mean the company stopped selling Juniors and Krimpets . " We froze product for three weeks before the shutdown to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did the work over the Christmas holidays when volume is at its lowest . " <p> Still , the pressure was on . " It was absolutely imperative that we have the floor back up in operation after 21 days , " says Kenney . " And we did . "

" Incorporating PC-based control hardware and software permitted a more flexible way to upgrade our machines without clashing with the existing machine controls as we migrated over , " says Fabri-Kal Electrical Engineer Dale Michaels . <p> Today , TwinCAT software monitors production on all trim press machine lines in all three plants owned by the company , including : temperature and pressure monitoring , heating and melting the plastic to precise temperatures , and preparing it for molding . All end-of-production-line trim presses throughout all Fabri-Kal facilities are actively monitored by Beckhoff PC-based controls , tracking the status of the machines and production data when finished product is coming off the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled flexible connectivity to the wide range of equipment we have in our plants . With TwinCAT software , Fabri-Kal achieved that while efficiently storing large amounts of information in an SQL database , " says Michaels . <p> In terms of hardware , the upgraded machine lines are equipped with compact CX2030 and CX1020 Embedded PCs . Both controllers are fanless and use solid state memory . The CX2030 features a 1.5 GHz Intel- CoreG i7 dual-core CPU for high performance from a DIN rail-mounted controller . The CX2030 and CX1020 Embedded PCs also play a large role in providing temperature monitoring and control during the mold forming process . In addition to serving as the automation and motion controller , the Embedded PCs are directly connected to EtherCAT Terminals , which constitute the I/O system . With microsecond-level communication performance , the industrial Ethernet system EtherCAT- enables Fabri-Kal to further enhance machine performance in terms of automation , I/O , and motion control . For the motion system , an increasing number of Fabri-Kal lines feature AX5000 series EtherCAT servo drives that not only add speed and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise from affecting the system . The I/O stations and drives along the lines are connected via EK1100 EtherCAT Couplers to distribute the I/O across Fabri-Kal machines , providing real-time data processing and diagnostics throughout the operation . This can directly help reduce raw materials usage and promote higher end product quality . <p> At Fabri-Kal , temperature is obviously an important factor for the thermoforming production of high-quality plastic products . Since the integration of the Embedded PCs and EtherCAT thermocouple I/O modules , their upgraded systems are able to react in real-time to adjust temperature levels accordingly , ensuring optimum temperatures for robust , high-quality product output . With real-time digital and analog data acquisition , Fabri-Kal can efficiently and effectively manage all system and process data gathered by the thermoforming machines . <p> To assemble comprehensive energy consumption data , the most significant factor in determining whether a facility is energy-efficient or not , Fabri-Kal uses Beckhoff EL3403 EtherCAT power measurement terminals . These terminals monitor the power transformers at Fabri-Kal plants and track electrical consumption hourly . " In the future I would like to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that consume power , " says Michaels . Since integrating TwinCAT , EtherCAT , and Embedded PC technology to their machine lines , Fabri-Kal can more effortlessly monitor and maintain machine line performance and data processing to forward their goals of keeping their green facilities in peak , energy-saving order . <p> With the increase in performance from PC-based control and EtherCAT , plus the additional monitoring and measurement capabilities available to Fabri-Kal today , the company proves that increased throughput of higher quality plastic packaging and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand . " Since integrating Beckhoff technology into our thermoforming machine lines , we have also improved remote networking and diagnostic capabilities such as providing real-time production and machine data to management and production personnel , " explained Michaels . " Many technology companies are adopting initiatives that promote more connected enterprises such as the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 . I feel that Fabri-Kal has made great strides to incorporate these big ideas , not just to latch onto a buzzword , but to generate meaningful results today that positively affect our bottom line . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious manual labor associated with documentation and data entry . Instead , the company 's highly automated systems track production output , yield , system downtime and system uptime . " With the comprehensive upgrades and addition of the Beckhoff solution , we are now able to much more precisely monitor machine and production parameters over EtherCAT . This in turn enables us to proactively make necessary adjustments long before there 's any threat of costly machine failure and downtime , " says Michaels . <p> On the automation and controls side , Fabri-Kal continues to integrate PC-based control technology into all of their packaging machine lines at all locations , enhancing overall data collection , programming , machine performance , and product quality .

@@22940827 @2940827/ <p> Flutes , the wavy arches between liners , put the corrugated in corrugated board , so much so that corrugated board is specified by flute . Borrowing from the GEICO commercials , " Everybody knows that , " but as those commercials teach , there 's always something else to be learned . Familiarity does n't always breed contempt ; sometimes it breeds complacency . It 's not unusual for a corrugated box 's specification to go unchanged for years on end . Implicit is the assumption that circumstances also have gone unchanged " a fallacy in thinking . <p> The Alphabet Song First came A-flute , later followed by others , in alphabetical sequence . The variety of flutes bespeak a variety of properties . The greater the profile ( height ) of a flute the greater the stacking strength and cushioning . The greater the count ( number of flutes per linear measure ) the greater the flat-crush resistance . C-flute is the most utilized . C might as well stand for Compromise because C-flute is shorter than A-flute but taller than B-flute ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B-flute has . It 's best to discuss flutes in comparative terms rather than to assign hard numbers to their profiles and counts . That 's because of differences in the corrugating process across different converters . <p> D-flute , for all intents and purposes , is not used in the U.S. E-flute and F-flute complete the list of the most popular flutes , consecutively smaller in profiles and greater in counts ; however , as industry proceeds along the alphabet , flutes need not automatically be of the miniature variety . How large flutes eventually get " or how small " will be limited only to advancements in corrugator machinery and the determination of customers to pursue custom-tailored solutions . <p> Putting it to the test A Box Manufacturer 's Certificate ( BMC ) displays the rating from either of two tests : Mullen ( a.k.a . Bursting Strength Test ) or Edge Crush Test ( ECT ) . Mullen measures the amount of force required to burst through the combined board . ECT measures the amount of force required to crush a sample of board that 's standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flute ( and liners ) , but before delving further into that association , some background on the tests might prove helpful . <p> Mullen is an indicator ( albeit indirect ) for a box 's ability to withstand rough conditions ( handling and ride ) . Its incorporation into carrier regulations harkens back to times when roughness was regarded as the major hazard to packaged cargo . Better unitizing methods , increased use of mechanical material-handling , and improved shock-absorbing systems on transportation equipment are some of the factors that have lessened concerns about roughness . <p> Over time , compression supplanted roughness as the greater concern , in recognition of conditions encountered not only during transportation but during storage as well , two legs of the journey wherein boxes need stacking strength against superimposed weight . But compression strength and stacking strength are not the same : the former measures the box 's ability to withstand a force momentarily before collapse ; the latter measures the box 's ability to withstand a force throughout its time in the supply chain . So the ECT , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented it from becoming the more popular rating on a BMC . <p> As if the indirectness between a given test and the associated box property were n't challenge enough , there 's no equivalence between the tests ; therefore , one rating ca n't be converted into the other . All of this was less imposing back when a great many shippers defaulted to what became the industry workhorse : 200 lb . Mullen test C-flute . Here , C might as well stand for Convenient because it relieved shippers from a host of considerations . It came at the sacrifice of cost-effectiveness , as shippers placed a higher premium on underpackaging than on overpackaging ; after all , having a margin-of-safety is only prudent , right ? Not if one has little clue as to the size of that margin . <p> Now and forward , competitive advantage will accrue to shippers that continuously fine-tune the elements of the supply chain . Regulations mandate that the BMC displays a Mullen or ECT rating , but that does n't make either test sacrosanct . Their relevance to a shipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of the boxes throughout the supply chain . <p> Yes , the choice of flute affects the board 's thickness , strength , and cushioning ( printability , too ) ; however , there 's also the issue of composition . A shipper should not uncritically accept just any grade of paperboard , regardless of how " standard " its basis weight ( i.e. , pounds per 1000 sq . ft. ) is said to be for flute formation . To do so is to forego the opportunity " better said , obligation " to make trade-offs between flute properties and liner properties for optimal results . <p> Thinking outside , inside , around , and through the box If there is one topic that symbolizes that the reign of the status quo is over , it 's sustainability ; unfortunately , more than an incidental amount of industry 's response lacks a systems approach . There 's no better example than recycled fiber . When , or should , recycled fiber be used in flutes ? When , or should , such flutes be teamed with **25;146;TOOLONG liners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content is allowable before a box is rendered unfit for its intended purposes ? <p> Recycling is one of the pillars of sustainability ; nonetheless , recycled fibers are shorter ( and therefore weaker ) than virgin fibers and the more times they are recycled the shorter they get . Additionally , to know that a box ( or any of its components ) is of a given recycled-fiber content does not impart knowledge about which kinds of recycled materials went into the mix , or how many times any of those materials had been recycled . <p> In the specification of anything made of corrugated board , decisions regarding flutes carry multiple ramifications . Giving those decisions their due consideration is the best way to end up playing the magic flute .

Such a capability is reason for brand owners to have in place a Pallet Purity Program ( PPP ) . <p> A synopsis Wood pallets treated with a fungicide were used to ship packaging materials to a McNeil Consumer Healthcare ( a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson ) facility in Puerto Rico . The fungicide metabolized into the chemical 2 , 4 , 6 tribromoanisole ( TBA ) , which impregnated the packaging . The chemical produces a musty odor , which was reported in consumer complaints , some claiming gastronomical distress from the ingestion of the product . The initial recall was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the wake , McNeil finds itself battling a corporate image challenge , stemming from charges by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that the company 's response to the problem was inadequate . <p> Even if your company is n't in the food or drug industries , it still can be vulnerable , because wood pallets treated for mold prevention can contaminate product/packaging that is not regulated by the FDA ( nor the U.S. Department of Agriculture ) . Certain so-called " Nutraceuticals , " for example , do n't come under the purview of either agency . Or what if you make toys ? Young children are notorious for putting toys into their mouths . If a pallet contaminates the toy 's packaging and the chemical is transferred to the toy 's surface , ingestion is quite likely . Product categories widen further under indirect ingestion , wherein the mere handling of the contaminated product/package transfers the chemical to the hands , providing a variety of inadvertent routes to the mouth . The prospects for ingestion of any sort aside , the chemical can cause consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a plastic bag , carton , or other absorbent packaging that emits an odor . The preceding examples combine to say that if chemically-treated wood pallets are part of a brand-owner 's supply-chain , that company should have a PPP. - - Breaking the moldNo member of the supply-chain wants to receive wood pallets that are visibly infested with mold. - In addition to the potential for product/packaging contamination , the workplace can be contaminated , in that some people are allergic to mold . Contamination aside , there 's the aesthetics : moldy pallets make for unsightly unit loads , not good for warehouse stores , such as Costco and Sam 's Club , with their reliance on sell-from-pallet . <p> Whether in response to customer complaints or to head them off , many pallet suppliers treat their products with a fungicide . Problems can arrive on several fronts . One is when a supply-chain member does not know that it 's receiving treated pallets . Another is when the member specifies against mold but does n't specify how it is achieved nor requires being told . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated pallets but does not know what fungicide was used . In each scenario , the end-result is the same : an inability to assess potentially negative consequences . <p> Fortunately , the consequences do n't usually rise to the seriousness of a product recall ; nonetheless , they always are disruptive . Even when chemical contamination is caught before it reaches the retail consumer , matters can turn ugly , as evidenced by lawsuits initiated by brand-owners and against pallet suppliers to recover the cost of adulterated products. - Clearly , the best approach is proactive , one devised to protect against mold , yes , but also against the untoward effects of a fungicide . - - - - Steps to fight moldMake the environment inhospitable . Mold spores are everywhere , settling on everything ; however , like all forms of life , they have their preferred environment : little air movement , warmth , and moisture . As such , ventilation , temperature range , and humidity levels are factors that must be controlled . <p> Assemble pallets from wood of low moisture content . Pallets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold growth , in addition to being more expensive to transport due to the added weight ( another drawback is that green lumber has less nail-holding capability than dried lumber ) . What 's low moisture content ? There 's some subjectivity , but 20-25% is an often-cited range . <p> Keep pallet surfaces dry . Even wood of low moisture content will support mold if the wood 's surface stays wet for extended periods , say , from exposure to the elements . Mold , after all , attacks wood surfaces , in contrast to surface-delving fungi that rot wood . <p> Since pallets are subject to mold from the time the wood is sawed , controls should start with the lumber and continue through assembly and all stages of the supply-chain . That means that responsibilities are diffused across the various members . The brand-owner , being at the center , must assume ultimate responsibility for the quality and fitness of the products that it places into the commercial stream . It is the brand-owner 's responsibility to develop a PPP that : fights mold in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages , motivates , and rewards pallet suppliers ( through specifications , audits , and continued business ) ; and monitors the downstream supply-chain ( through the detection and correction of conditions that promote pallet mold ) . - About fungicides Any fungicide used to treat pallets should justify itself on two fronts . The first is efficacy , that is to say that it actually prevents mold . The second is that it fulfills its function without damage to people , product , and profits. - The problems with the chemical at the center of the Tylenol recall are not new ; for example , its ability to taint food and beverage has been known for a decade " or more . It 's not surprising , therefore , that there are fungicide suppliers that advertize that their products do n't contain the chemical that gives rise to TBA . I am not advocating for nor against any particular chemical , including the one that triggered the recall . What I do advocate is that the brand-owner knows whether the pallets in its supply-chain have been treated for mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be determined . <p> On a related note , suppliers of plastic pallets point out that their products do n't require fungicide treatment . Whereas those suppliers should not be begrudged their prerogative to trumpet perceived advantages , the fact remains that plastic pallets have their own trade-offs , plus , the supply-chain totally devoid of wood pallets is an anomaly , to say the least. - The systems concept in evidenceThe Tylenol recall underscores the fact that packaging is a systems concept . Consider that the primary packaging ( the plastic bottle ) was impacted by the tertiary packaging ( the pallet ) , proving that all levels of packaging are interdependent . Furthermore , just as packaging spans multiple disciplines , so does a PPP , embracing , as it does , the entire supply-chain. - Even so , there 's another aspect of a pallet purity program and that 's the control of insect infestation " phytosanitation , it 's called ; however , that 's deserving of its own article . 
@@22940865 @2940865/ <p> Growth opportunities for blow moulders , especially those in PET , are in no short supply . AMI 's research suggests that the latent potential for PET barrier bottles in beer , wine , and milk is equivalent to the current size of the carbonated soft drinks ( CSD ) market for PET bottles in Europe , which was just under 1 million tonnes in 2009 . <p> Glass is reaching its limits in terms of light-weighting , and there is growing doubt among the brand owners about its ability to evolve with market needs . The growing emphasis on the carbon footprint of packaging supply and end of life management will prove a compelling competitive advantage for plastic packaging . In particular , PET will present an increasingly persuasive case in terms of sustainability , technical performance , and aesthetics . The future growth of the blow moulded bottles business in Europe will increasingly be driven by the growth in PET packaging in new markets . <p> The potential in beer and alcoholic drinks is highlighted by the low penetration achieved to date with plastic bottles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging for these products in Europe . While PET bottlers have long coveted these markets , without ever achieving that step-change breakthrough , there is now a growing interest in and acceptance of PET for beer and other alcoholic drinks driven by three things : the improved economics of bottle production compared to glass , PET 's favourable LCA , and the growing emphasis on pack weight reduction . One litre-plus PET bottles are already widely used for beer packaging in Eastern Europe and here their market penetration is close to 45% . PET bottles work in Eastern Europe because they do not require the same shelf life as in Western Europe . Beer packaged in PET is generally consumed within 5 weeks . However , the monolayer bottles used incorporate an O2 scavenger to support a 4-month-plus shelf life to minimise the risk of spoilage . <p> In Western Europe , PET beer bottles are predominantly used for sizes of 500mL and below . These can be found in Germany , Switzerland , France , Spain , Italy , and Scandinavia . The drivers behind the introduction of beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environmental lobby , and the wholesale movement to PET bottles for one-way packaging in Germany . The Western European brewing industry favours integrated blow moulding and filling of one-way PET bottles as the most effective production strategy . However , this is still more expensive than one-way glass bottles , which continues to suppress penetration levels . Over the long term , demand is expected to be buoyed by <p> the improving economics of PET , through raw materials cost reduction and production efficiency and scale , making pricing comparable to glass bottles the favourable LCA of one-way PET versus glass the growing emphasis on and commercial benefits of pack weight reduction . <p> Even so it is likely to take PET some time yet to knock glass off its perch . At AMI we forecast the demand for PET bottles in this market to advance at around a rate of 10% annually in these applications over the next 3-4 years . <p> Other opportunities are expected to emerge in food markets , where plastic bottles have yet to make a major impact . The constraint thus far has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies used to package food already exist for jars , cans , and cartons . However , plastic bottles are expected to be able to make penetration gains over the next few years thanks to growing investment in aseptic cold filling , improved barrier monolayer PET bottles , and the sustainability argument . For example , jam in PET is well established in the USA , and Europe is expected to see an increasing number of introductions in squeezable PET bottles for this product over the next five years . <p> The UK enjoys the highest penetration level of squeezable bottles for jam in Europe , where they are already widely used for table top sauces . Within the rest of Western Europe steady penetration gains in sauces and spreads will underpin demand growth , whilst demand in Central and Eastern Europe will evolve with the further development of the packaged goods industry . The universal driver is user convenience in terms of squeezability , dosage control , ease of handling and safety , and again , pack light-weighting initiatives . <p> In the UK , the move into plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chivers and Hartleys brands . Supermarket own brands have been close followers . In Germany , the chocolate spread manufacturer Cebe has introduced a PET jar made by Alpla to reduce the pack weight from 198 g ( glass ) to 23 g . The light weight container has a blown rather than injection moulded neck , saving 5 g in PET . <p> While beer and solid food markets represent large , untapped opportunities for plastic blow moulded bottles , for now the blow moulded bottles market is still largely driven by developments in the mineral water and household chemicals markets , where plastic bottles account for more than 90% of the packaging used . In these markets the trends are more about inter-material competition , with growing volumes of recycled PET being used in mineral water bottles and growing use of PET bottles in household chemicals packaging thanks to a reduction in the price point of PET versus HDPE and a growing preference for clear packaging to display the product . <p> Within the bottled water industry in Europe , glass bottles are still used for premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of premium , glass-like PET resins promises to open this niche to plastic bottles over the next five years , as a light-weight , shatterproof alternative with greater scope for design flexibility . For example , Novapet of Spain has developed a glass-like , premium PET resin to produce a thicker-walled bottle , to give it the appearance and haptics of a glass bottle . Although three times heavier than a conventional PET bottle , it is still five times lighter than glass , making a considerable contribution to weight saving in transport , with minimal quality compromise . This may also open up scope for penetration of the table wine and other alcoholic drinks sector . <p> PET 's growth in household chemicals In household chemicals the trends are about inter-material competition . HDPE is the dominant polymer within this market . However , with the substantial reduction in price differential between polyolefins and PET , PET bottles continue to grow their market penetration . <p> Colgate-Palmolive was the first to switch to PET and Procter &amp; Gamble too has converted all dishwasher products ( i.e. Fairy Liquid ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HDPE . Other leading fillers in Germany have also converted . <p> Yet within companies such as Unilever , Procter &amp; Gamble , and Colgate-Palmolive , the balance of polymers is still broadly 75:25 in favour of HDPE versus PET . This presents a significant substitution opportunity for PET in applications and bottle sizes that do n't require a handle or are not subject to tight cost constraints . While growth prospects in general may be promising , the business remains challenging for raw material suppliers and converters alike in Europe . The forward focus for fillers is resource-efficient supply , driving the market toward on-site manufacturing options be it HTW ( hole-through-the-wall ) , self manufacture , or blow moulding of preforms . This is limiting the ability of traditional converters to add value , while for European resin suppliers this is mainly a commodity business increasingly threatened by cheaper Asian and Middle East imports . <p> The competitive nature of the business is driving consolidation throughout the supply chain and the top 10 moulders accounted for one-third of polymer conversion in Europe for blow moulded bottles in 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong position as a supplier of blow moulded bottles , preforms , and HTW services . For 2009 it purchased in excess of half a million tonnes of polymer for its European operations and accounts for more than 10% of the market . The company has built its position through its investment in a network of in-plant blow moulding operations at its customers . Other major blow moulding groups which similarly operate a network of HTW or in-plant operations for the major food and drink companies include Logoplaste , Serioplast , Nampak Plastics Europe , and Graham Packaging . In PET preforms and bottles the leading company is Artentius PET Packaging , which acquired Amcor 's PET business in Europe in 2007 . <p> Plastic closures Given the growth in blow moulded bottles , it is not surprising to see plastic closures as another area of strong growth within the rigid plastics packaging market . With output of more than 220 billion units/year , production had been growing at a rate of nearly 6% per year prior to the recession , with the use of HDPE one-piece closures growing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated that plastic caps and closures now have a market penetration of over 50% of the total closures market in Europe , exceeding metal closures in terms of unit demand . Again , as in bottles , the drivers are cost reduction and light weighting , which is encouraging the use of one-piece closures in preference to two-piece closures . <p> While standardised one-piece and two-piece beverage closures are the bedrock of the closures business , custom closures represent an even greater opportunity to moulders in terms of added value . They include products such as non-standard diameter flat caps , sports caps , carton mechanisms , and pouch spouts . Growth in this sector of the market is driven by strong demand for sports closures but also by the further development of 38-mm caps and carton mechanisms . <p> Beverages account for around two-thirds of plastic closures in Europe , in a business driven by developments in still drinks ( e.g. sports drinks , juice-based drinks ) and the growing penetration of one-way PET bottles replacing cans and cartons . Demand for plastic beer closures is also expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles in Eastern Europe . <p> Within non-beverage applications , liquid food is the largest sector of the plastic caps and closures market in Europe . In this segment demand will be driven by increased penetration of PET bottles in dairy applications , and by growing substitution of glass packaging by plastic containers in table top sauces , preserves , baby food , cooking sauces , and dehydrated and snack products . <p> Heat-stable PET The development of heat-stable PET barrier containers is opening new markets to plastic closures , such as juices , preserves , pickles , cooking sauces , soups , and baby food , which are traditionally packed in glass containers and sealed with steel vacuum closures . Further opportunities lie in cold-fill applications such as honey . <p> There will be an increasingly apparent geographical divergence in strategy in Europe . In Eastern Europe , investment will focus on mass production of standard beverage closures to serve the global brands as they move eastwards , while market maturity will steer Western Europe towards de-standardisation through developments in custom 38-mm closures , sports caps , and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sustainable differential advantage will lie at the centre of strategies over the next five years , focused on improved functionality , convenience and modernity . <p> Consolidation in this sector is even greater than in blow moulding , with the top ten manufacturers accounting for around 60% of polymer usage for closures . The industry is expected to concentrate further in future as a result of consolidation among the brand owners ; the higher levels of R&amp;D and technical expertise required in plastic closure development ; the requirement for quality standardisation on a pan-European if not global basis ; and growing competition from closure manufacturers outside EU-27 . AMI 's research suggest that the sector could lose up to 150 companies over the next five years in an industry which currently involves as many as 500 manufacturers across Europe . <p> Carole Kluth is a senior research manager with Applied Market Information Ltd .

Written specifically from a packaging perspectiveLearn more &gt;&gt; <p> Article February 9 , 2011 <h> Survey measures packaging 's importance and packagers ' strengths <p> Survey of packagers shows where priorities are . But with each key capability , survey respondents across industries indicate there 's plenty of room for improvement . <p> What is the importance to your company of key packaging department capabilities ? And for each capability , how would you rate your company 's strength ? <p> These two questions were at the heart of a recent survey conducted jointly by Packaging World , Packaging &amp; Technology Integrated Solutions- and HAVI Global Solutions . Responses to the survey raise this question : If the importance of a capability is perceived as high but the company 's strength in that capability is recognized as low , what 's the best way to close the gap between perceived importance and recognized strength ? The answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , is to build a set of integrated capabilities that packaging pros can use to meet greater corporate challenges . <p> The survey covered such key capabilities as packaging engineering , material development , and program management . Respondents ranked functions on a one-to-five scale from " not important " to " very important . " <p> Then , respondents made a second ranking , this time rating whether a function was " weak to strong " in the respondent 's packaging department , also on a one-to-five scale . <p> Leading the list of important packaging functions was packaging engineering and quality assurance ( Figure 1 ) . Respondents ranked packaging engineering at 4.2 and quality assurance at 4.17 on the survey 's one-to-five scale " clearly standing above other functions in importance . <p> " Packaging engineering is the main focus of most CPG packaging professionals ' jobs , so it is no surprise it is ranked high , " says Brian Wagner , a PTIS principal and co-author of the survey . <p> The survey amplified the packaging professionals ' challenges by pointing out where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering was compared to how strong the function is within companies , a significant gap appeared ( Figure 2 ) . The gap was 0.6 points on the survey 's one-to-five scale . <p> One reason for the gap may be the changing skill sets needed by packaging engineers . <p> " Like most professional fields , packaging engineering has different needs than it had 10 years ago , " offers Tom Biddie . He is vice president of product development-Americas , at HAVI Global Solutions . For packaging engineers , he lists the following as key skills needed today : <p> Ability to strategize . " In the simplest terms , it is being able to connect the dots , " Biddie offers . <p> Process engineering <p> Equipment engineering <p> Sustainability <p> Being business savvy " the capability of packaging professionals to understand the business/financial impact of their decisions <p> PTIS 's Wagner offers this analysis of today 's needs , " The challenge is often that packaging engineers are expected to be well rounded and have deep technical skills . Yet they must have deep business skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentoring we do , and that is a big part of the gap between importance and strength that showed up in this survey . " <p> An insight comes from one survey respondent who suggests the gap in between importance and strength may reflect the increasingly important role of private label in retailer strategies . " I develop private-label packaging for a large retailer , " the respondent said . " The vast majority of retail merchants do n't value development time and are familiar with only sourcing a finished product . " Packaging , this respondent suggests , is n't the least bit important , but rather is viewed as an unavoidable and thus necessary part of the total cost of goods . <p> Like packaging engineering , the quality assurance function also saw a 0.6-point gap between importance and strength . But the reason for the gap is related more to technical issues . " It probably reflects technical training more than business issues , " says PTIS ' Wagner . He notes that the way quality assurance is handled today compounds problems seen with packaging recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent training on statistical process control , " says Wagner . " Some packaging professionals today receive training and certification in Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma quality programs . However , it is not emphasized as a standard part of development and training . At the same time , quality assurance groups have been cut over the last 20 years , with more emphasis applied to the suppliers , with expectations that they will assure quality-delivering COAs and COCs with their products . Unfortunately , quality issues , including packaging-related product recalls , have become ' normal . ' " <p> HAVI 's Biddie offers this insight , " We suspect that challenges related to specification management may be captured as a gap under quality assurance . Companies may believe they are doing spec management sufficiently well , but the problems are captured during the quality assurance process . Companies need to build the business process and integrate quality assurance into their business model . " <p> A number of survey respondents from overseas said global sourcing may also influence the gap between importance and strength in quality assurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in five from organizations located outside the United States . U.S.-based multinationals also added to the global scope of respondents . <p> India and Latin America were dominant locations of non-U.S . companies answering the survey . This is consistent with forecasts that see India and Latin America as emerging economies poised for major growth in the next five years . " We believe that India and Latin America are two strong emerging markets ; they have developed the infrastructure and are searching for technical knowledge , " notes HAVI 's Biddie . <p> One of the overseas respondents to the survey puts the overseas quality assurance issue in this light : " Quality cost is too high . In our country , the majority wants cheap products . " <p> While packaging engineering and quality stood " head and shoulders " above all packaging functions in importance , other capabilities were more tightly grouped , with a gradual drop in importance ( Figure 3 ) . Training and education showed a gap between perceived importance and recognized strength about as large as for packaging engineering and quality assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments Wagner , " but there is a need for more continuing education . Training and education need to emphasize competencies and platforms that are important to the specific organization . <p> " Training programs need to be based on identification of each employee 's strengths and weaknesses . Establishing a training and education roadmap for an organization and for individuals is critical . With everyone seemingly too busy , this often lacks priority . " <p> Sustainability ranked in the middle of the pack where importance is concerned . Considering all the ink it 's generated over the past few years , this is a bit surprising . Mike Richmond , a PTIS principal who has authored training materials on sustainability , makes this observation . " The packaging professionals who are implementing sustainability have to get senior management buy-in on programs . It needs budget along with staff . This is an area where a business sense is important , too . Sustainability strategies and business objectives have to align . " <p> Another perspective comes from Jennifer McCracken , a senior environmental manager at HAVI Global Solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management to guide product and packaging design are not only managing risks but also gaining a competitive edge . To succeed , it is essential to leverage resources that can identify critical sustainability issues across the product 's lifecycle , address them with practical solutions , and inform business strategy . " <p> One survey respondent underscored packaging 's role in sustainability . " Packaging engineering and material development will definitely drive the packaging world towards the rising agenda of sustainability , " he wrote . <p> Food companies , with about one-fourth of the overall responses , accounted for the most responses to the overall survey . Beverage , health care , consumer products , and industrial products were other major industry segments responding . <p> Consumer products was the industry segment that ranked packaging highest overall in importance , giving it a 4.5 out of 5 ( see Figure 4 ) . Yet they ranked their overall strength at only 3.75 , so there 's a sizeable gap between perceived importance and recognized strength . This could reflect a need based on the drive toward innovative products in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to commit to the resources in packaging to deliver the innovation and packaging strength they want to drive sales of consumer products . <p> Food , beverage , and health care also topped 4.0 when it came to ranking the overall importance of packaging .

In health care , the regulatory environment that 's in place helped drive the overall importance of packaging . As for food , it could be that the gap between perceived importance and recognized strength reflects input by companies in developing countries where the regulatory environment has not yet reached U.S. standards . <p> Overall , packaging 's move toward having a " seat at the corporate table " is progressing , observes PTIS ' Brian Wagner .

@@22940890 @2940890/ <h> Induction sealing requires coordination <p> Induction sealing is a non-contact process but by no means in the " hands-off " sense . To the contrary , induction sealing requires a high degree of coordination , due to the various suppliers involved and the many associated variables . <p> Induction sealing is used for a wide variety of products across such categories as food , beverage , pharmaceuticals , cosmetics , and household chemicals . A closure with a composite liner inside is screwed onto a filled container ( bottle or jar ) . The container then travels by conveyor under an induction sealer which spreads an electromagnetic field that heats the aluminum foil layer of the liner . The heated foil , in turn , causes the heat-seal layer to melt , and the container is thereby sealed. - An induction seal prevents product leakage , is tamper-evident , maintains product quality , and fosters consumer confidence . That 's a nice benefits bundle for a CPG company , but to consistently achieve it , that company has to have coordinating skills , like those of a crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner , and induction sealer have to be chosen for their mutual compatibility . <p> Container <p> Glass containers can be induction sealed , but the majority of induction-sealed containers are plastic . After the choice of material is made on the basis of product compatibility , the concern shifts to the determination of what can be sealed to the material . It 's always advisable for a CPG company to let a container supplier know that the container will be induction sealed . But even then , not every supplier appreciates the implications . A supplier , for example , might subject the container to a surface treatment , such as fluorination ( to combat paneling ) or corona-treatment ( to increase polarity ) but not know that either can negatively affect induction sealing . <p> The finish is the container 's structural feature that 's most fundamental to induction sealing . The dimensions of a container 's finish are designated in standardize nomenclature : I , E , and T across the width , S and H along the height . Maintaining those dimensions within specified tolerances has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish and closure that 's crucial to a quality induction seal . Additionally , the finish should be free of deformations , particularly in the land area ( the top area that 's sealed ) ; for , if the land is anything other than flat and smooth , the closure will not fit securely and the induction seal will be compromised . <p> Closure <p> A continuous-thread ( CT ) closure has dimensions ( E , T , S and H ) that relate to the same dimensions on the container 's finish . Even so , the respective dimensions can be mismatched , resulting in conditions that adversely affect the induction seal . An example is a mismatch of the vertical dimensions of the closure and finish , which can result ( among other things ) in the inability of the closure to be screwed sufficiently tight on the finish. - Another type of mismatch can occur between the tread of the container 's finish and the tread of the closure . Tread types are designated by a single letter ( L and M ) and differ in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tread on the container is a different type from that on the closure , the treads will not engage properly . <p> Plastic closures ( thermoform or thermoset ) lend themselves well to induction sealing . The same is not true of metal closures . The same electromagnetic field that heats the aluminum foil in the liner can heat the metal closure . Such a heated closure can distort a plastic container 's finish . <p> Liner <p> The liner is inserted inside the closure by the closure manufacturer , which either makes the liner or sources it ( the latter adding yet another level of coordination ) . Liners can be a one-piece or two-piece construction. - With a one-piece liner , the aluminum foil has a heat-seal coating on the side that will be in contact with the container 's finish , and on the other side a resilient material such as paperboard or plastic foam . During induction sealing , the entire liner is sealed to the container 's finish . <p> With a two-piece liner , the aluminum foil has a heat-seal coating on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum foil to a pulpboard layer . During induction sealing , heat from the foil melts the heat-seal , but also the wax that is absorbed by the paperboard . The results are that the foil is sealed to the container 's finish and the paperboard remains inside the closure . <p> The one-piece vs. two-piece decision hinges foremost on the type of closure suited to the product . A dispenser closure , for example , should have a one-piece liner because the paperboard left by a two-piece would prevent dispensing . And in keeping with product considerations , the aluminum foil might need protection against certain ingredients , in which case a barrier layer should be incorporated into the liner , whether one-piece or two-piece . <p> Induction sealer <p> - - - The equipment has a power source and a sealing head ( a cooling system , too ) . The power source generates in kilohertz . The sealing head can be of a flat or tunnel design . The geometry of the capped container determines the suitability of the generated power and of the design of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , good for wide finishes , and higher frequencies produce a narrower field that 's good for narrow finishes . Likewise , a flat sealing head is better for wider finishes , and a tunnel head is better for narrower finishes . Of course , there are CPG companies that have to seal a wide variety of finishes , and that can be even more the case with contract packagers . Fortunately , there are hybrid sealing heads designed for the required flexibility. - By the time the combined container , closure , and liner reach the induction sealer , any preceding lapses in coordination can manifest themselves in problems that ca n't be countered by the induction sealer , no matter how efficient the equipment . Of all the involved parties , which one has ultimate responsibility for the end-result ? It 's the CPG company that must coordinate at every level . Additionally , it 's the CPG company that must coordinate any investigation regarding seal failures . That 's the topic of the next article .

How well you 've designed your package to account for what the shopper sees , thinks , and reacts to while in your category can positively or negatively influence your sales performance on a daily basis . To help you convert more shoppers into consumers through your packaging , follow these eight principles of sales-effective package design . <p> 1 . Stand out : You 're doing it wrong . Standing out on the shelves of high-volume retailers amongst a sea of 30,000-plus products requires boldly different approaches than what most brands are taking . Break the rules , break boundaries , and break new ground . You 'll never know your true sales potential if your package does n't effectively work to nab the shopper 's attention . <p> Packaging 's number-one responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet most of what we see in stores is brands blending in , instead of standing out . <p> Shoppers fight grocery store attention-deficit disorder with routine and speed . To attract new customers , we have to design to interrupt those shoppers who are on a B-line path to the brand they buy week-after-week . When shoppers survey a category from three- to four-feet out , we have to stop the scanning eye . <p> Do n't go barging into your design team 's office demanding the loudest , most obnoxious package the category has ever seen ; there are tactful ways to stand out . Consider introducing a new package structure that also improves the consumer experience , or utilize colors and symbols , or strokes and borders that are designed to attract the eye from a distance . Do what has n't been done , go for it , stand out . To sit quietly on shelf is to leave sales on the table . <p> 2 . Present a clear hierarchy of information for hurried shoppers . Hurried shoppers gravitate toward packaging that presents the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those brands that design with respect for hierarchy are positioned to appeal to shoppers who just want to grab and go . Limiting and prioritizing copy and design elements on your package are 101-level fundamentals , yet it 's so tempting to throw in one more claim or symbol , or introduce yet another font style ? but this is an urge that can bring overwhelming disorder to the eye . <p> Beyond knowing that the eye wants to read top to bottom and left to right , mastering hierarchy involves knowing that shoppers in the canned tomato aisle hardly need to see the word tomato ; they are more interested in finding the type of tomato they need ? chopped , whole , stewed , diced-faster .

It makes the brand tangible to consumers and creates visual recall in their minds . When asked to envision a brand , quite often , consumers will call the packaging to mind . Not only that , they will recall specific visual aspects of the packaging . <p> Think about what happens in advertising . Products are usually depicted either being enjoyably consumed or being put into use , depending upon the category . Close-ups of product packaging are shown , often more than once , so that consumers can recognize it in retail environments . Over time , with repetition , the packaging and its visual assets are firmly associated with the brand . That 's great until these products appear in retail stores surrounded by competing brands . <p> Even though advertising helps to build brand recognition , purchase decisions are ultimately made at the retail shelf where competition among brands is fierce . Packaging that is visually dominant and convincing gets consumers ' votes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands . Visual cues are honed in on before verbal brand communication is , making it extremely important to ground the package design with the correct imagery , an icon or visual hook , typography , and color to deliver real impact . <p> Too much consumer product packaging fails to attract the eye , ensuring that every bit of verbal brand communication that might be a difference maker in purchasing one product versus another goes unread .

Learn more + <p> Glenroy invites you to download this playbook . <p> Article April 30 , 1997 <h> The king of cups <p> Start-up company Dr. McDougall 's Right Foods had lofty targets for packaging speed and accuracy . So it invested heavily in sophisticated packaging equipment before it even had a product ready for the marketplace . <p> Charged with reducing a high cholesterol count eight years ago , Jim Ahrens enrolled in the McDougall Program , a 12-day , live-in arrangement that relies heavily on a vegetarian diet therapy . Little did he know that , in addition to lowering his cholesterol count , his stay would lead to a whole new food company driven by a million-dollar packaging line that Ahrens believes is the most sophisticated and accurate of its kind at filling dry soup in cups . " We 're the king of cups , " he says proudly . <p> Dr. McDougall 's Right Foods is the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joining him as co-founder is Dr. John McDougall , founder of the McDougall Program and a nationally recognized nutrition expert who teaches better health through vegetarian cuisine . Ahrens and McDougall became friends after Ahrens underwent the McDougall Program , and their friendship led to the formation of a new company guided by McDougall 's philosophies on nutrition . <p> The two-year-old firm now markets 12 products formulated by McDougall . All are single-serve portions of dried or dehydrated foods to be reconstituted by adding boiling water . Though most are soup or soup-like offerings averaging 2 oz ( 56.7 g ) in dry weight , the line also includes a rice pudding dessert and two varieties of oatmeal . Nutritionally , all are high in dietary fiber , have no cholesterol or added oil , and use minimal salt and sugar . They retail for between $1 and $1.50 . <p> As for the million-dollar packaging line , there were few other options , says Ahrens . <p> " After capitalizing the company , with help from 280 shareholders , we looked first at co-packing as a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after visiting a number of plants , we realized that co-packing would be difficult because we did n't want our product to come in contact with machines that might have run oils or dairy products like dried cheese or milk . We wanted a ' clean ' product . " <p> The other drawback to the co-packers , says Ahrens , was that most of their packaging lines did n't offer the number of ingredient filling stations that McDougall 's needed for the multi-component products it was planning . They could n't guarantee accurate weighments either . " We wanted the same amount of each item in each cup each time , " says Ahrens . <p> The search begins <p> The search for equipment led Ahrens and plant manager Nick Vacalo to Food Equipment Manufacturing Co . ( Bedford , OH ) . That firm provided the backbone of the filling and lidding system that McDougall 's has now been running since April ' 96 . But plenty of other vendors were involved . <p> Cup feeding , transport , and lidding are the main responsibilities of the FEMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of equipment that handles ingredient placement , which occurs at as many as four separate stations . <p> Prior to packaging is the ingredient blender , supplied by Ashbrook ( Houston , TX ) . Here again Vacalo and Ahrens spared no expense in getting the best equipment available . <p> " Many food firms in our situation might use a ribbon or paddle blender , " says Vacalo . " But ours is a plow blender like you 'd expect to find in a pharmaceutical company . It will blend minute amounts of one ingredient in a large batch evenly in three minutes without generating lots of heat that might harm or degrade the product . " Batches are dumped into wheeled totes for transfer to the nearby packaging line . <p> First is cup feeding , which is accomplished by a pair of FEMC rotary cup feeders , one for each lane of the two-across system . Each feeder holds 20 stacks of 50 nested cups , and when one column is empty , the next one automatically rotates into position over the denesting tools . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lip of the cup and cleanly separate it from its stack before dropping it into a pocket on the transport belt . The feeders hold about 20 minutes ' worth of cups at filling speeds typically in the range of 100/min . <p> Once a pair of cups has been pocketed , they 're conveyed into the first filling station , which is served by a 12-bucket Ishida combination scale from Heat and Control ( San Francisco , CA ) . It 's divided down the center so that six buckets drop their contents down a tube into one lane and the other six feed the other lane . Used typically for weighing ingredients such as baked chips , pasta shreds or oats , the scale is accurate to within -1/2 g on a 30-g fill . <p> The second filling station is occupied by a dual-head Spee-Dee ( Sturtevant , WI ) volumetric cup filler . The Model CME filler includes a staging valve option that helps increase speeds by holding one fill in the staging area while the next fill is being measured above it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket elevators from Deamco ( City of Commerce , CA ) , the hopper of the Spee-Dee unit is fed by a vacuum transport system from Piab ( Hingham , MA ) . " It 's the best way to deliver delicate items like freeze-dried apples , for example , without breaking them up , " says Nick Vacalo . Though the volumetric cup filler is not as accurate as the combination scale , Vacalo says it does n't need to be because the ingredients handled in this second fill station are not nearly as expensive as those weighed in the first station . Fills are well within the targeted range , adds Vacalo . <p> Next in line are two auger fillers from GEI Mateer-Burt ( Wayne , PA ) that deliver ingredients like beans or rice . Each receives product through a single Deamco bucket elevator system . A gate diverts the ingredients into whichever Mateer-Burt hopper needs it . <p> The ingredient feed system at this point in the line has a special feature designed into it at Vacalo 's request . Often in auger filling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as 20 lb or so before the sensor signals for replenishment . But when the hopper has been refilled , it might hold 200 lb . This big difference in product weight can be accompanied by a proportional fluctuation in head pressure that can cause uneven fills . One revolution of the auger when the hopper is full may discharge more product than when the hopper is nearly empty . <p> To avoid such inconsistencies , Deamco added a product level sensor closer to the top of each Mateer-Burt hopper . This results in virtually constant replenishment of the hopper , which in turn means steadier head pressure at the auger and more consistent product discharge with each and every cycle . Accuracy is about the same as it is on the Spee-Dee volumetric filler upstream . <p> The fourth and final ingredient metering station is for spices . It 's occupied by two more auger fillers from GEI Mateer-Burt that have the same Deamco product feeding and diverting system as the first two . But servo motors and a computerized weighing system make these auger fillers considerably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vacuum removes dust <p> With all ingredients deposited , cups are conveyed through a vacuum station that removes dust from their rims to help ensure the integrity of the cup-to-lid seal . Then cups are automatically rotated until a SICK Optic-Electronic ( Eden Prairie , MN ) scanner determines that the UPC bar code on the sidewall is properly positioned to receive the lid . When the paper lid is applied , cover pull tabs are positioned uniformly in the center of the back panel . It 's a matter of consistency in appearance , says Ahrens . <p> Lids are picked by vacuum cups from magazines and placed on cups , which then pass through two heating stations . The first station performs a flat seal only . But in the second , the material is crimped over the edge and sealed . " By sealing over the edge , " says Vacalo , " we get a much more secure seal than if we just sealed to the flat surface . " <p> After ejection from the machine , cups pass through a metal detector from Graseby Goring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink-jet coding on each lid , performed by an Excel unit from Videojet ( Wood Dale , IL ) . The information printed includes a lot number so if a recall becomes necessary it can be done easily . <p> Just before an accumulation turntable , a final checkweigher from Heat and Control checks weights and rejects bad cups . Then operators manually load cups into corrugated shippers erected by hand . The shippers hold only six cups each so that retailers can stock a greater flavor variety than if McDougall 's Right Foods were in 12-count cases . <p> Finished cases are sent through a top-and-bottom taper from 3M ( St. Paul , MN ) . McDougall 's uses the same 175#-test C-flute case for all 12 SKUs , printing four lines of variable information on-line with a Videojet ink-jet coder . <p> " One of the goals of this line is efficiency in changeover , because you ca n't anticipate , especially in a new and growing market , how your orders are going to come in , " says Vacalo . " With this on-line system we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move right into production . We do n't have time to look for preprinted cases . " <p> Running now for almost a year , the line is used primarily for McDougall 's own brand of product but gets occasional use for co-packing assignments from other marketers of food in cups . Future additions to the line are already on the drawing boards , including a robotic case packer . That would probably mean the line could run with one less operator than the four who currently man it . <p> One other adjustment under consideration is the possibility of shrink wrapping cups or groups of cups in clear film having oxygen and moisture barrier properties as well as oxygen scavenging ability . Minimizing moisture will keep product from clumping during long-distance shipments to humid climates . Keeping oxygen out , and absorbing it in a sorbent film when it does enter , will prolong product taste and freshness by keeping tomato components from oxidizing . <p> Whatever other changes the firm comes up with , they 'll all be aimed at enhancing its ability to capitalize on a trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Consumption of vegetarian meals is skyrocketing , whereas five years ago you could hardly give those products away , " he observes . He 's convinced the trend will continue , and with the packaging line he and Vacalo have assembled , McDougall 's is ready to take full advantage .

A dual hot and cold glue system solves the problem , and increases output . <p> Whether eating one for breakfast or packing one for lunch , few people give much thought to how oranges reach them from the groves of Florida or California . At Baird-Neece , on the other hand , they think a lot about oranges in transit . Nestled among the orange groves in Porterville , CA , this member of distributor Sunkist Growers , Inc. , packs at least 14O cases of oranges daily-each case holding up to 88 oranges-for distribution in the U.S. and as far away as the Pacific Rim . Recently Sunkist , which sets material specs for some packaging components its members use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner than the one used previously . Despite providing a better printing surface , this liner prevented case flaps from absorbing hot melt sufficiently , which in turn caused some cases to pop open during shipment due to changes in temperature . Baird-Neece plant supervisor Harley Nuckels explains . " If you 're precooling cased fruit and placing it into a truck , the temperature will change . When it gets to market , the temperature changes again , and the top case on the display pallet has a tendency to pop open . " He says that frustrated retailers were rejecting cases of oranges-and demanding a solution to this problem . While selecting a case is the decision of Sunkist Growers , selecting a sealing method is left up to the packing houses . Although other packing houses found other ways to combat difficulties encountered with the new cases , such as using taping systems , Baird-Neece elected to stick with the Nordson ( Duluth , GA ) hot melt system it was using on its Standard-Knapp ( Portland , CT ) Model 49 top and bottom case sealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its case flaps ? Another obstacle was that the citrus case has die-cut holes for ventilation , making accurate adhesive placement critical . The single-wall C-flute standard RSC citrus container is produced by Fruit Growers Supply ( Van Nuys , CA ) . It includes a 35#-test white liner that 's flexo-printed in three colors . An open and shut case The solution was to add a Nordson cold glue system.The top adhesive station on the Standard-Knapp case sealer and the bottom one as well each includes two Nordson H-200 hot melt guns . Each gun applies a 3/32 " half-round bead , 3 " long , on the minor flaps of the carton . Simultaneously , eight Walcom(TM) LV217 liquid adhesive guns from Nordson ( four guns per station ) deposit cold glue beads on the major flaps using 0.3-mm dia nozzles . To assure the cold glue straddles the box vent holes , Nordson designed special gun-mounting brackets with a photoeye sensor and electronic timer . They move side-to-side up to 23/4 " apart , allowing adjustable gun positioning . " We had a good Nordson unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't handle the new box material and high-humidity conditions . Adding a secondary cold glue created a bond that would seal immediately and withstand our tough environmental factors , " says Nuckels . The H-200 hot melt guns include Resistance Temperature Detector ( RTD ) sensors for precise temperature control and consistent viscosity . A Nordson Model 2304 applicator supplies the hot melt and provides a tank capacity of 18.7 lb and system melt rate of 20 lb/hr . The LV217 guns incorporate a zero-cavity needle for a sharp adhesive cut off , while helping prevent adhesive curing or adhesive sticking to the nozzle . A Walcom WM-60 piston pump from Nordson dispenses cold glue at a 12:1 fluid-to-air ratio . With their compact profiles , both the Nordson hot melt and cold glue guns retrofitted easily to the case sealer . " Nordson did a good job plumbing the system , " says Nuckels . " The set-up is clean , efficient and easy to maintain . " With the previous system , cases would even open up on the packaging line , resulting in downtime . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the system actually allows higher production , from about 1O cases/hr to 1O+ cases/hr . " You can increase by about four hundred cartons an hour , " Nuckels says .

@@22940938 @2940938/ <p> Product marketers often ask this question : How can we validate the value of package design for senior management ? For Unilever 's Suave brand , the answer comes by letting the new design pull itself into the market through quantifiable cost savings and consumer benefits instead of the marketing department pushing a design that fails to link anticipated benefits to the overall business strategy . <p> Unilever succeeds by meeting two internal objectives in restaging its Suave Naturals shampoo and body wash lines and its Suave Professionals shampoo line . The company communicates each line 's price-value relationship more effectively to consumers while also reducing production costs . Input from a cross-functional team guided the process , and Unilever has achieved the following results : <p> The company increased dollar sales volume for the Suave Professionals line by 51% and unit volume growth by 12% , even with a retail price increase for the line . <p> Dollar sales volume for the everyday Suave Naturals line increased 3% and unit volume grew 2% during the new packaging 's first 12 weeks on the shelf . <p> Consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new packaging . <p> Unilever has sustained Suave 's leadership in the value hair care segment while also improving the brand 's profitability . <p> Unilever achieved these results in part by integrating visual cues of shape , color , and texture , yet avoiding frivolous decoration , to communicate Suave 's niche as a quality product at the right price . Unilever switched to a wider cap and lighter-weight materials to deliver visual impact while also reducing costs . <p> " Not only is the major redesign of our relatively generic bottle a major win for our consumers , but the added production efficiencies and cost savings for Unilever made it a true win-win situation , " says Eric Yoch , senior brand development manager at Unilever . " The growth in sales volume has exceeded our expectations and solidified our leadership of the value segment . " <p> Yoch explains that the success of this project springs largely from early internal discussions among multiple departments at Unilever that also included an outside design firm and packaging vendors . It was essential , he says , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer needs , but also its manufacturing capabilities prior to launching the creative stage . <p> Design considerations <p> Unilever 's needs were two-fold . From a business perspective , the company wanted to maintain Suave 's leadership in the value hair care segment and also gain a greater market share for the Suave Professionals and Suave Naturals product lines . On the consumer side , the company wanted to better serve the Suave consumer 's perception of value . <p> In addition , the work had to be done in the context of recent changes in the hair care aisle . Suave is a 70-year-old brand sold at mass merchandisers , supermarkets , drugstores , and value retailers . It is one of the most recognizable hair-care brands , but it takes its place on the shelf alongside more competitors than ever . The hair-care aisle has seen significant changes in the past year that intensified competition among brands . According to Mintel ( www.mintel.com ) , these changes include a proliferation in the number of products containing organic ingredients , new launches with botanical and herbal claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these changes with the launch of Sunsilk . <p> " The size of that launch , and the resultant competitive activity , raises the total water level of the category , and Suave could n't be left behind , " Yoch says . <p> A critical initial step in beginning the redesign of Suave packaging was writing a design brief . The creative team worked with the manufacturing , operations , and R&amp;D departments inside Unilever , as well as with suppliers . Together , they shaped the basis for packaging that would reflect the Suave consumer 's definition of value while also reducing packaging costs . <p> Structural packaging innovation firm 4sight ( www.4sightinc.com ) collaborated with Unilever 's internal market research team to study the mind-set of Suave consumers and then create the design . Stuart Leslie , president of 4sight , explains . " Unilever had an unusually good idea of who Suave consumers are . They 're smart shoppers who want beauty but do n't want to compromise . They want value " it 's not elegance but more like straightforward blue jeans . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpay for it , " he says . <p> Value , in the Suave consumer 's mind , is multi-dimensional . It considers quality , variety , and performance at an appropriate price . The consumer research preceding the design stage validated this understanding and provided a baseline for package designs that would enable Suave to deliver on this value equation . The final designs spurred consumers ' willingness to pay more for Suave products . <p> Unilever opted for a subtle and sophisticated look for both Suave Professionals and Suave Naturals. 4sight designed a slimmer bottle with curved , sculpted proportions resembling the female hourglass shape . The contoured shape provides a waist area that is easier for consumers to grasp with wet hands . <p> " By designing the package with simple , contoured sides , we could incorporate a wider label and mold the brand logo into the bottle , " Leslie says . " This subtle detailing expresses the Suave story and contributes to its special look . " <p> The shape of each bottle also considered production needs . " Our designers visited the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge we needed to develop a compelling package that also maximizes Unilever 's resources , " Leslie says . <p> Meanwhile , Unilever 's operations and R&amp;D departments developed strategies internally for achieving some of the cost savings . Unilever 's vendors also offered ideas for cost savings in the bottles and closures . <p> The packaging uses a wider cap and lighter-weight materials to not only enhance the look of the packages , but also reduce production costs . Unilever says both the bottles and caps use less resin " the reduction is 1 gram in the cap . The caps ' shorter finish , combined with the overall design 's enhanced top-load carrying capabilities , required significantly less material in both the closure and the bottle , according to Unilever . <p> Besides signaling subtle sophistication and value visually , the curved Suave Naturals bottles reduce production costs . The curves of the bottles require that the bottles touch the filling machine only at the rounded portion . As a result , the bottles are filled at higher speeds . <p> The results of the package redesign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all interests are considered upfront in package redesign and development . When the right design with the right materials can also produce a cost savings , it 's logical for everyone to support the redesign . <p> " The interesting thing that we learned in doing this project is that most people associate a cost savings with a compromise at the shelf to consumers . We found that you can have both at the same time , " Leslie says .

These ranged from packaging for food &amp; agricultural products to packaging for hazardous and dangerous goods . <p> Four leading experts from academia , industry , and the US government provided keynote presentations on plastics and sustainability : The Future of Bioplastics and Biomaterials in the New Green Economy ; Global Packaging Trends in the Food and Beverage Industries ; Packaging and Logistics to Support the War Fighter ; and North American Containerboard Supply to Global Markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This conference was also generously sponsored by several of the leading trade associations , brand owners , consulting firms , research equipment manufacturers , and material and packaging manufacturers from the packaging field . A record 23 sponsors " Packaging World was among them " made this event highly educational , exciting , and memorable for all . <p> At most academic conferences the topics are presented from a deeply scientific perspective , and as such are generally considered too technical to be of immediate practical use to everyday packaging professionals . Though the conference at Cal Poly was held primarily for the scientific community , there were numerous lessons for today 's practitioners . This article reports on several innovative presentations made in the focus area of Packaging for Food &amp; Agriculture . <p> In the topic area of Active and Intelligent Packaging , as related to food packaging , several examples related to innovative concepts were presented . The use of silver ions as an antimicrobial agent in food applications was discussed by a group from the Novel Materials &amp; Nanotechnology Group at Spain 's University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporation of silver ions from a salt compound of silver into polylactide acid ( PLA ) matrices by a solvent casting technique . The ions were reported to not affect crystallinity , water permeability , or water-induced plasticization of the materials , and they were homogenously distributed along the surface and thickness of the films . Antimicrobial assays according to the broth dilution method in M9 medium reported a bactericidal effect of the films after daily washings during the 6 , 30 and 60 days of experimentation of the films with 0.01% , 0.1% and 1% silver , respectively . These results represent a step forward in the understanding of silver antimicrobial efficacy and its possible application in the food packaging industry . <p> More Antimicrobials <p> A presentation representing numerous collaborating companies was made by the Institute of Molecular Chemistry from the University of Burgundy in France . This presentation covered antimicrobial performances of some natural extracts in packaging . This work is being done with active films , and the presentation reported the results of experimentation involving the incorporation of thymol and carvacrol at 1 wt% in PP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , that residual concentration of the active compounds was sufficient to inhibit microorganisms and an overall migration of below the established limit ( 10 mg/dm2 ) except for the case of filled PP . <p> A presentation from a group representing both Amcor Flexibles and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences discussed the development of palladium-based oxygen scavenging film for food packaging . Using magnetron sputtering technology , the group coated palladium on the packaging films ( PET and PET/SiOx ) with the goal of removing residual oxygen in packages that remains after modified atmosphere packaging . It was reported that palladium-coated PET/SiOx films inhibited the vitamin C degradation in orange juice and orange segments significantly and preserved the color of ham . <p> An engaging presentation made by Multisorb Technologies provided a great overview of sustainable packaging through active controls and materials selection .

A presentation by the Danish Technological Institute reported on the optimization of frozen fish packaging for microwave steaming . The investigation pointed out that there are serious problems with both cooking instructions and packaging of such products . Optimal reheating times are not being clearly stated , so that overheating is too commonly the outcome .

They like its clarity , resistance to heat and chemicals , and gas barrier properties ( see PW , July ' 95 , p. 26 ) . With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of PEN homopolymer for food contact applications , U.S. firms are said to be chomping at the bit for similar approval of PET/PEN blends and PEN copolymers . Such approval will allow users of PEN to dial in only as much of the costly material as they need , thus keeping packaging costs in line . <p> Near-commercial applications involving PEN are surfacing in greater numbers . Also , steady progress in the commissioning phase of Amoco 's naphthalene dicarboxylate plant in Decatur , AL , makes it clear that sufficient feedstock for production of PEN will be availabe for future applications involving large volumes . In the meantime , a look at a few of the recent PEN containers to emerge provides a good measure of PEN 's progress . <p> Perhaps the application closest to true commercialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltd . This small manufacturer on the Scottish island of Arran is an established marketer of branded premium jams , traditionally hot-filled in glass jars . But recently Arran began filling single-serve salad dressings in PET containers for British Airways . Unlike the jams , the dressings can be filled at ambient temperatures , so PET is perfectly adequate . <p> Now Arran would like to grow its business with the airlines , and management believes that packaging its jam in a lightweight jar made of a PET/PEN blend could be the way to do just that . ( In Scotland , as in the rest of the U.K. , regulatory approval of PET/PEN blends for food contact has been issued . ) The jar is injection stretch/blow molded on an integrated single-stage system by PET Partners ( Etten Leur , The Netherlands ) . The PEN is supplied by Shell Chemical ( Akron , OH ) , says PET Partners ' Koos Gommars . But he declines to reveal the ratio of materials in the pellet-to-pellet blend . The empty jar weighs just 10 g , while the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PET Partners is financing part of Arran 's project , which consisted of a 10O -unit production run . These units are being used by Arran for sampling purposes , not only in the offices of British Airways but also for other customers that may be interested . It 's likely , however , that the airlines will see the strongest benefits in the jar since even the smallest weight reduction helps save fuel . <p> Supplier support <p> Also aggressive in promoting the filled jars are the three suppliers behind the jar : Shell Chemical , which provided the PET/PEN blend ; Amoco Chemical ( Chicago , IL ) , supplier of the NDC feedstock for the PEN resin ; and blow-molder PET Partners . They helped Arran produce an elaborate windowed gift-pack carton holding four samples of the 28-g jams .

A brightly decorated pressure-sensitive label includes a strip that runs over the edge of the cap and adheres firmly to the sidewall of the jar , thus providing tamper evidence . <p> A glass jar , by contrast , would not need the TE label . Its TE feature is the internal vacuum generated in hot-filled glass jars as headspace contracts during cooling . Theoretically , consumers are accustomed to listening for the " pop " that comes when this vacuum is broken . If they do n't hear it , that 's their evidence that the package is suspect . <p> The Arran jar , however , has no internal vacuum . Its sidewalls ca n't take the pressure . In fact , care must be taken to minimize or avoid creating an internal vacuum . Arran 's solution is the injection of liquid nitrogen . The temperature of the hot-filled food product causes the nitrogen to evaporate , and in its gaseous state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the internal vacuum pressure . <p> While this counterpressure approach is certainly effective , some suggest that it compromises a food manufacturer 's ability to use automatic seal inspection systems , most of which rely on a strong internal vacuum . Also gone is one 's ability to hear the release of internal pressure that indicates seal integrity . <p> " That 's not such a problem where a high-acid jam or jelly is concerned , because if spoilage occurs due to a bad seal it 's likely to form mold , and that 's not going to harm anyone , " says Nina Goodrich of Guelph Food Technology Centre ( Guelph , Ontario , Canada ) . " But what about a soup or some other low-acid food ? " The possibility for growth of pathogens and resulting illness or death , she suggests , is certainly present in such cases if seal integrity is faulty , and consumers may not be forewarned by odor or discoloration . <p> Goodrich is n't saying that the liquid nitrogen approach is n't appropriate in some applications . There 's certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-filled in aluminum cans . But at recent technical conferences she 's been recommending that other alternatives should be explored . For instance , she thinks thermal stability in PEN containers can be maximized by paying closer attention to design features . <p> Forgotten lessons ? <p> " Too many of the PEN containers I 've seen have n't taken into account all that we 've learned from hot filling of beverages in PET bottles , " she observes . One specific lesson that should be explored , she says , is the use of stress panels to relieve pressure on a bottle 's sidewalls . Or , she suggests , a flexible barrier lidding-foil , foil laminate , PEN film-could be heat- or induction-sealed to the container to become the equivalent of a stress panel ; any sort of overcap could then be used for reclosure purposes . Goodrich also suggests that fill temperatures might be lowered slightly and the amount of headspace minimized as well , both of which reduce the internal vacuum pressure that 's formed during cooling . <p> Goodrich and her colleagues at Guelph continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including flexible films . At recent conferences she 's shown a pouch made of 3-mil Kaladex- , the PEN homopolymer film from ICI Americas ( Wilmington , DE ) , that was filled with carrot puree and then processed in a Lagarde steam air retort at 25-F for 40 min . " It retorted beautifully , " says Goodrich . She adds that , judging by the number and variety of pouch-producing systems she saw at interpack 96 , she 's convinced pouches made of PEN could surface commercially before too long . <p> Goodrich believes that as soon as FDA clears PEN copolymers and PET/PEN blends for food contact , food companies will rush to market with new applications . She 's already working on container trials to reassure food packagers that PEN can be handled in their processing , packaging and pasteurizing or retorting systems . " They know that marketing is going to want a PEN container yesterday as soon as approval comes , " she adds . <p> Goodrich also thinks U.S. brewers are excited about PEN , and developments overseas suggest European brewers feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greiner &amp; Sohne ( Kremsmunster , Austria ) passed out samples of beer from the Mayr brewery , located near Greiner 's Kremsmunster headquarters , that were packaged in half-liter refillable bottles made of Shell homopolymer PEN . While Mayr has n't committed to marketing the bottle commercially , the interpack samples are a sign that commercialization of a PEN bottle for beer in Europe is probably not too far off . <p> According to Greiner marketing manager Kenneth Boldog , PEN appeals to European brewers because it appears to provide all the clarity , gas retention , and oxygen barrier needed to get beer through the distribution system . Yet compared to glass , it 's shatter-resistant and light . He says a half-liter returnable glass bottle weighs between 420 and 500 g , while the same bottle in plastic is 40 to 60 g . <p> Customized shapes <p> Also attractive , says Boldog , is that PEN would allow beer marketers to differentiate their packages through customized shapes . Currently in Europe , not much more than label graphics can be used to set a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be achieved more readily than with glass , says Boldog . <p> Greiner is working with brewers large and small in Austria , Germany , The Netherlands and the U.S. , says Boldog , to develop 0.3- and 0.5-L bottles that contain various levels of PEN . He expects some of these bottles to be on retail shelves in three to six months . <p> Greiner 's objective is to have them capable of withstanding 50 trips . Thus , the bottles wo n't come cheap . He estimates they 'll cost between two and four times as much as glass currently used . But by all indications , he says , brewers are prepared to pay the premium . ( For more on the Greiner bottle , see p. 84 ) . <p> Brown beer bottles are popular in Europe . So SIPA worked with suppliers of colorants to develop a liquid color concentrate that can be added directly to the throat of the extruder via a reciprocal pump . <p> Also of interest is the closure , supplied by Rical ( Dijon , France ) . Injection molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of ethylene vinyl alcohol for oxygen barrier among its seven laminated layers . <p> Filled at 5-C ( 41-F ) , after one hour the bottles were placed in a 40-C ( 104-F ) bath that was gradually raised to 65-C ( 149-F ) . The bottles remained at 65-C for 20 minutes of pasteurization , and then they were placed 12 per case for storage at 23-C ( 73.4-F ) . <p> " In general , the results from the test have been extremely positive in terms of carbon dioxide content after both one and two months at 23 degrees C ... when compared to the glass bottle references , " said Masini . Both glass and PEN bottles were also tested after eight weeks at 40-C , which is the equivalent of two years at ambient temperatures . Masini pointed out that beer would normally not require anything more than a 12-month shelf life , but the accelerated test was performed anyway for the sake of analysis . In this test , Masini told his Bev Pak audience , " Both glass and PEN bottles show degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent with the PEN bottle . " <p> Not showing any signs of degradation is the interest in PEN . <p> " We 're getting a lot of opportunities to quote or advise on our ability to supply for some applications , and we 're pursuing these aggressively , " says Jim Caldwell of Eastman Chemical . Also occupying a chunk of Caldwell 's time is the newly-formed Naphthalate Polymers Council , where he 's joined by representatives from Hoechst , Shell , ICI and others . High on their list of things to do is developing an identifying mark so that consumers and sorters can recognize PET bottles easily and quickly ; the FDA calls for this mark in its regulation permitting the use of PEN homopolymer for food packaging . <p> Also intrigued by PEN is Coca-Cola Co . The Atlanta-based beverage giant announced in March that it plans to test a PET/PEN blend for a single-serve bottle sometime somewhere this summer . Corporate communications officer Carol Martel tells PW that plan still holds . <p> " We 're definitely interested in PEN 's performance characteristics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial marketplace , " says Martel . As tests go , it 's sure to be closely watched .

Learn more &gt;&gt; <p> Article May 31 , 1997 <h> Bottle drinks from the stream of technology <p> American Beverage Marketers warm-fills its Finest Call cocktail mixes into new PET bottles , then injects liquid nitrogen . The LN2 prevents bottle paneling and helps to extend shelf life . The PET bottle replaces PP , providing greater clarity and appeal for the product 's introduction to the retail market . <p> In March , American Beverage Marketers reintroduced its line of Finest Call(TM) cocktail mix products in a clear 1-L bottle made of polyethylene terephthalate . What allows the company to warm-fill the products into conventional PET bottles is the addition of liquid nitrogen ( LN2 ) that creates pressure to keep the bottle sidewalls from paneling as the product cools and internal vacuum pressure builds . <p> At its " absolute " temperature , LN2 is LN2 has been used for years , often to provide internal pressure for noncarbonated beverages filled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edible oils and sauces can introduce LN2 gas to eliminate the need for heat-set bottles or extensive sidewall ribbing . <p> ABM distributes 14 cocktail mix flavors nationwide , to taverns and other on-premise customers . Thirteen products are in PET , a Bloody Mary mix is filled into glass . And for the first time , the New Albany , IN-based firm will introduce Finest Call to the retail market . At press time , retail product was ready for limited distribution , in the same 1-L bottles , using the same components . PET 's clarity and barrier characteristics , company president George Wagner notes , are particularly appealing to retailers . <p> The PET bottles are injection/stretch blow-molded by Grafco ( Hanover , MD ) . The system used to dispense the LN2 is from Reynolds Metals Company 's Can Div . ( Richmond , VA ) . <p> Before shifting to PET , ABM sold Finest Call in a polypropylene bottle . The PP version represented a step up from its high-density polyethylene predecessor . The switch to PP was made a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 , p. 43 ) . That bottle earned a Bernard M. Seid Best of Show Award from the National Assn. of Container Distributors for ABM 's distributor Ryco Packaging ( Omaha , NE ) . ABM also procures the PET bottles through Ryco . <p> Breaking barriers <p> " We decided to switch to PET for its performance characteristics compared to PP , " says Wagner . " The oxygen barrier is superior compared with the former bottle . Clarity was another important issue . Even though the PP bottle provided better clarity than the milky HDPE version we had originally , the PP offers contact clarity , in which you can see the color of the product through it . However , the PP was still a bit cloudy compared to clear-as-glass PET . " <p> Wagner says , " it was our goal all along to get into PET , " but until recently , he admits , sales volume could n't justify the economics of the move . " Our sales of Finest Call grew about 60 percent in ' 96 compared to ' 95 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PET over the past few years made it the obvious choice . The aesthetic appeal PET provides is important to our on-premise customers who are very image-conscious , and it 's imperative for the retail market . " <p> Notable bottle <p> By late last year , ABM and Ryco began searching for a competent PET molder . " We talked with different companies , " recalls Wagner . " Many of them told us that to warm-fill PET , we 'd have to use a fully-ribbed bottle . That did n't appeal to us . Ryco led us to Grafco and we chose Grafco for its ability to provide custom solutions and its willingness to meet our needs . " <p> According to Dale Behm , Grafco 's director of engineering , " most of the challenges involved in the Finest Call bottle were in the up-front design and engineering . We used a single-cavity set-up mold , making numerous insert changes so we could zero in on what we needed to do to make a prototype bottle . " <p> By the end of February , Grafco made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We used several tricks of the trade , " quips Behm , " to create the bottle . " Unlike other companies that recommended extensive ribbing , Behm says , " we sat down with George and developed alternatives . We limited the number of ribs necessary to support the bottle . " <p> The Finest Call bottle relies on two subtle primary " ribs " that circle the bottle , one located just above the base , the other just below the bottle 's shoulder . <p> Additional support comes from the rather clever use of recessed panels on the front and back of the bottle . Each panel is embossed with the Finest Call logo . In shape , these recessed areas replicate the " splash " graphic on the bottle 's neck label . And while these logos might look solely like graphic devices , they primarily add structural support . <p> Grafco uses a Nissei ASB 650 ( Atlanta , GA ) single-stage machine to injection-mold a preform and stretch/blow-mold the preform into a bottle . The PET resin is supplied by Nan Ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own proprietary molds to make the preform . The custom mold used to stretch/blow-mold the Finest Call bottle is owned by ABM . <p> The six-cavity Nissei 650 produces more bottles per cycle than the two- and four-cavity machines ABM 's former blow molder used for the PP bottle . The improved output and cycle times , says ABM 's Wagner , " provided an economic advantage for us . " That , he explains , " is because Grafco 's higher bottle-per-minute output means that they get more production out of their equipment than our previous molder did . That means Grafco 's costs are less than our former molder 's costs . They pass those savings along to us . " <p> Wagner says he expects payback on the molds " will take less than one year . " Economic advantages are especially helpful since PET resin costs about 4% more than the PP . <p> Depending on the success of the new product , a higher-cavitation mold may be necessary . " We 'd have to produce in the neighborhood of seven to 10 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wagner contends . <p> The injection/stretch blow-molding process produces " a very precise finish , " says Wagner . " As a result , we modified our custom closure by adding to the length of the threading to match the bottle finish . Now the closure fits more securely on the bottle . " <p> According to Grafco , the PET bottle 's oxygen transmission rate is 4 cc/100 sq " /24 hr , compared to 230 cc/100 sq " /24 hr for PP . That advantage is amplified , says ABM 's Wagner , by Grafco 's process which increases the level of crystallinity in the bottle sidewalls . How this is done , however , is something Grafco would n't divulge . <p> " That helps to extend shelf life , " Wagner says . " We did n't have any qualms with our shelf life previously , " he notes , " except for some of our products that had only a six-month shelf life . But we 're always looking to improve on our shelf life . That was one of the goals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than doubled the shelf life of Finest Call compared to the polypropylene version . " The former bottle had a six-month to two-year shelf life , depending on the mix . <p> Cooperative research <p> Grafco places molded bottles neck-down , 12 per printed corrugated reshipper case . Cases are palletized and shipped to ABM 's New Albany plant . At the plant , Finest Call is filled on the same line as it was when PP bottles were used , with the same equipment for the most part . <p> Operators turn cases upside-down so that bottles stand right-side-up on a conveyor . Filling is done at speeds in the 130- to 150-per-minute range on a 24-head rotary pressure/gravity filler . Cocktail mix fill temperatures vary between 110-F and 165-F , the same as they were with PP . <p> After filling , bottles are conveyed to Reynolds ' LN2000 system . Wagner says he originally got the idea to use liquid nitrogen from a story in Packaging World on how LN2 countered the internal pressure within a jar hot-filled with jam ( see PW , July ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with polyethylene naphthalate ( PEN ) . <p> At press time , Grafco 's Behm said that the bottle maker was entering into an alliance with Reynolds to further research the use of LN2 for a variety of applications using PET . <p> Metering matters <p> The LN2000 has been used primarily in Europe , though Asia , and now the U.S. , are investigating its potential for applications other than cans , according to Shawn Burrows , sales service representative for the Reynolds Metals Can Machinery Div . <p> The LN2000 includes a stainless-steel outer shell . The LN2 itself is supplied by local firms , in " dewars " usually containing 160 or 185 liters ( 42.27 and 48.88 gal ) of the liquid . The dewars are specially insulated to maintain the LN2 's cold temperature . <p> As filled bottles index single-file to the LN2000 , fiber-optic sensors monitor a bottle 's speed and relay it to a computer . A second set of sensors are positioned at the point where the LN2 is dispensed . When the bottle is sensed at this position , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LN2 . Bottles con-tinue at line speeds through the dosing process , without stopping . The dispensing valve is closed by a simple spring mechanism . <p> The LN2 is dispensed from a point about 3/8 " above the top of the bottle . The dose varies between 1/5 and 1/2 g , says Burrows , depending on the specific product . A larger drop is added to products that contract more severely . <p> ' No-dome ' seal <p> The LN2000 is mounted to the same automatic capper that had been used before . Capping is done after LN2 is injected . It applies an injection-molded PP closure supplied by Hi-Tech Mold And Tool ( Louisville , KY ) . The change in threading to accommodate the bottle 's more precise neck finish is the only new aspect of the closure . Unlike many closures that are shaped flat to fit right against the top of the bottle , this one protrudes about an inch above the bottle finish to provide a pour spout . <p> Because of the protrusion , Wagner says , " We were afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cause a ' doming ' effect with the liner . " That could cause the liner to slightly move before sealing and prevent a solid seal , or result in a breakage between the liner and bottle after sealing that could cause leakage . <p> To avoid those potential scenarios , ABM upgraded to induction sealing . Its previous sealing method for the PP bottles is described by Wagner as " pressure sealing that causes the seal to activate when the cap is torqued down tightly onto the bottle . " <p> Wagner turned to a Model 2221-W induction-sealing system from Pillar Technologies ( Hartland , WI ) . Because of the unusual closure , " we originally used the Pillar system on a contingency basis , " he says . " After it proved itself in tests , we bought it . It has worked tremendously for us ever since . " <p> The Pillar induction unit seals the liner to the bottle 's finish . Supplied by Selig Sealing Products ( Forrest , IL ) , the liner includes a foam backing that contacts the closure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On the line at New Albany , the induction-sealed bottles index to an automatic labeler that applies a paper label to the neck of the bottle . Bottles are then hand-packed , 12 per reshipper . Since last year , ABM automated its palletizing process by purchasing an A-B-C ( Tarpon Springs , FL ) Model 72X palletizer . <p> Expect further changes <p> ABM continues to look for ways to improve its Finest Call packaging process . It 's already working closely with Grafco on a bottle for its Bloody Mary mix , which is currently sold in a glass bottle , also in a 1-L size . " Tomato-based products are especially sensitive to oxidation compared to the other cocktail mixes we offer , " says Wagner . " We 're testing it in warm-filled PET , and so far it looks promising . " He says the cost difference between glass and PET would be insignificant . <p> Bottle lightweighting is also in the offing , courtesy of the circular ribs , recessed panels and the LN2 . " Grafco is running tests on lighter-weight bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the bottle reduced from 70 to 60 grams in the near future . " <p> Grafco and Wagner are also looking at blends of PET/ PEN for " items that are highly sensitive to oxygen , like Bloody Mary mix , strawberry puree and pi " a colada . In those instances , PEN would provide a stronger barrier , " he notes . " But for economic reasons , we 're looking at PET/PEN blends as opposed to straight PEN . <p> " We want to see if these blends will meet our needs so that we 'll know if they 'll work if they 're use is approved by the FDA , " he says . " We 're always trying to stay on the forefront of technology . " <p> American Beverage Marketers is making quite a splash with its Finest Call cocktail mix bottle . The company 's competitors , as well as other food and beverage packagers who could benefit by using liquid nitrogen for PET applications , will likely be watching closely to see how well the technology swims . 
@@22940983 @2940983/ <p> Because of your commitment to quality the high cost of handling consumer complaints and the threat of potential lawsuits you are seeking solutions to contamination problems before they become costly . <p> You 've heard of X-ray inspection and now you 're asking : is X-ray the solution to my problem ? <p> Any product can be inspected with X-rays . Whether or not the inspection is successful however depends upon the product the defect and the limitations of the technology . <p> We have designed this article to help you determine whether your application meets the criteria and help you decide if X-ray inspection is the solution you are seeking . <p> What are X-rays ? How do they work ? <p> X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation ( as are microwaves radio waves ultraviolet and visible light ) which were discovered to have an exceptionally useful property : X-rays pass through matter at a predictable rate . This property opened up a world of applications and in many ways revolutionized science and industry . <p> It was discovered that a specimen placed between a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film resulted in a picture of the interior of the specimen . X-rays passing through the specimen are stopped by matter in the specimen at an I-rate which corresponds to the relative density of the specimen . The denser the specimen the fewer X-rays reach the receiver . In this way X-rays allow us to " see " inside opaque objects . <p> How are X-rays produced ? <p> For most industrial and scientific applications X-rays are generated with a device called an X-ray tube head . <p> Electricity is applied to a filament which emits electrons that stream towards an anode which is embedded with an angled tungsten plate . When electrons bombard the plate two things are produced : heat which is siphoned off by means of a cooling system ; and X-rays . X-ray tube heads are especially useful because of safety considerations . Since they do n't rely on radioactive isotopes to produce X-rays tube heads are completely inert and therefore safe to handle when power is not applied to them . <p> Because the high amount of heat produced could otherwise reduce the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the tungsten plate and oil or water is pumped through them to take away the heat . This provides the cooling necessary to extend the life of the tube head . <p> How do X-ray inspection Machines Work ? <p> For most X-ray inspection systems the basic principle of operation conveys the product between an X-ray tube head and a receiver ( usually a solid state linear array of Xray sensitive photo diodes ) . The photo diodes detect the level of X-rays which pass through the product to generate picture elements ( pixels ) which correspond to levels of gray between ' 0 ' ( no X- rays detected ) and ' 255 ' ( maximum Xrays detected ) . The pixels are then combined line-by-line into a coherent image which is either analyzed by a human operator monitoring the image on a video screen or a built-in computer designed for this purpose . <p> Evaluating the X-ray image : Recognition systems <p> Once an image of a product is acquired it needs to be analyzed for the presence of defects . Two basic methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions and automatic which utilizes computer hardware and software to make decisions . Three systems are available with our X-ray inspection equipment . These include visual recognition and two types of automatic detection : density threshold and morphology processing . <p> Visual Recognition <p> With a visual recognition system a human operator monitors a video screen on which the image is displayed when acquired by the X-ray unit . Upon detection of a defect the operator initiates a rejection sequence . <p> Strengths : Because it relies on the fastest most efficient computer known the human brain to make decisions visual recognition systems can be very effective at finding unusually shaped items small defects or analyzing particularly complex images . Additionally because of their minimal hardware requirements visual recognition systems tend to cost less than their automated counterparts . <p> Weaknesses : Humans can be costly to train and are subject to lapses in concentration fatigue or other distractions that can affect the overall performance of the system . <p> Examples of appropriate products : <p> -+ Cooked and stripped chicken . <p> -+ Beef or pork roasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the density of the product . <p> -+ Any large irregularly-shaped discrete product . <p> Automatic Density Threshold <p> Density Threshold requires an operator to set a density threshold above which indicates the presence of a defect . If the computer detects a density level above this threshold a rejection sequence is initiated . <p> Strengths : Products such as formed patties or bulk applications such as nuts are ideal for density threshold because their consistent thickness and density rarely causes false detection from the product itself . <p> Weaknesses : The most significant limitation of a threshold image recognition system is that products which naturally vary in thickness or in density can not be reliably screened by it . With such products natural variances in product thickness or in packaging density can trigger false detection . <p> Examples of appropriate products : <p> * Dried beans or nuts . <p> * Formed chicken or beef patties . <p> * Any bulk product or any discrete product with a consistent thickness and density . <p> Automatic Morphology Processing <p> For products unsuitable for density threshold a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike Density Thresholding which analyzes the image line-by-line morphology considers the image as a whole . By submitting an acquired image to several different enhancement procedures the morphology processor accounts for natural variations in thickness or density and eliminates packaging from consideration as well . <p> Strengths : It can detect contaminants inside packaged products as well as contaminants in products which naturally vary in thickness or density . <p> Weaknesses : Since each image enhancement procedure requires a finite processing time the speed with which the system can reliably detect contaminants is limited by the speed of the computer . For some applications maximum throughput with a morphology processor may be too low . <p> Examples of appropriate products : <p> * Product in jars or cans . <p> * Any discrete product with inconsistent thickness or density . <p> * Any packaged product . <p> Eliminating the defects : Reject systems <p> Because there are so many products that can be scanned by X-ray inspection systems reject systems vary according to application . <p> They include : <p> * Single-action pneumatic push which rejects products off of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for patties <p> * Air ejectors ideal for dry bulk products like nuts <p> Additionally our equipment has the capacity to incorporate customized reject system designs . If your application requires a special reject system not currently offered we may be able to design one . <p> Evaluating X-ray inspection for your application <p> In evaluating the suitability of X-ray inspection for your application consider the product the defect and the throughput . Each of these is important in its own right yet must also be evaluated with respect to one another . <p> Is the product suitable ? <p> A product suitable for X-ray inspection must be able to be transported across the machine . Carefully consider the size of the machine - belt clearance for belt machines maximum and minimum jar sizes for jar inspection units etc. - when evaluating your product . Obviously products too large to fit through the machine or too small to be resolved by the image processor are unsuitable for X-ray inspection . <p> Additionally consider the method of product transportation . Liquids and slurries can be inspected prior to packaging on pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection machines . Dry bulk product like nuts or berries can be inspected on belt machines either directly on-belt in a continuous stream with machines equipped with density threshold or in individual trays on machines equipped with visual or morphology processing . X-ray inspection system manufacturers are aware of the tremendous potential for their technology and are constantly developing new ways to handle products which had previously been thought impractical to inspect using X-ray . <p> What are the defects ? <p> X-ray inspection systems detect differences in density and identify defects which differ in density from the product itself . <p> Complicating matters is that every individual product ( as well as every defect ) has its own " density profile " which incorporates product thickness as well as density . Products that naturally vary in thickness or which are packaged in a high-density material have a " good product " density profile which covers a broad range . Defects which fall within this good product density range can be difficult to detect . The size of the defect is an important consideration as well . X-ray systems have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be detected . <p> Regardless of the size or shape of the defect its suitability for detection is always evaluated with respect to the product . Since Xray systems detect density differences the density of the defect with respect to that of the product is a significant factor in determining defect suitability . For instance chicken skin and chicken meat differ slightly in density . Their density relative to one another however is too small to result in reliable detection by an X-ray inspection system . For this reason alone it is best to arrange for an application test with an X-ray inspection system manufacturer before determining whether or not a defect can be detected by X-rays . <p> What is the required throughput ? <p> While the concept of using X-rays to inspect food is relatively simple image processing -- automated or visual -- is a complicated endeavor . It takes several seconds for example for a trained human operator to thoroughly inspect an image on a video monitor for the presence of defects . Similarly finite computer processing time limits the speed with which an automatic recognition system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system throughput is limited by image processing time . <p> Additionally throughput is affected by product handling considerations . Discrete product for instance must be inspected item-byitem lowering the maximum through-put as compared to that for bulk product which is inspected in a continuous stream . <p> Safety . An important consideration <p> For any application involving X-rays safety is a necessary concern . We have taken several steps to ensure the safety of operators of our equipment : <p> * All of our X-ray systems use low energy X-rays contained within a high-grade stainless steel cabinet designed to prevent any leakage . <p> * X-rays are generated only when power is applied to the X-ray tube head . No radioactive isotopes are used in the system . <p> * Numerous safety interlock systems have been integrated into the system design to prevent the unit from being opened while X-rays are generated . If an attempt is made to open the machine while it is in use power is immediately severed to the X-ray tube head . <p> With regards to applications for the inspection of food : <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose equivalent to one-fifth of the recommended maximum dose uptake for food as endorsed by a 1990 World Health Organization memorandum . <p> * The U.S.D.A. has approved similar equipment for use in federally-inspected meat and poultry plants . <p> With regards to government registration of X-ray systems each country and individual states have their own specific registration requirements . It is our policy to work closely with our customers and any regulatory agencies to ensure complete compliance with all rules and regulations . <p> Application testing : The best way to get the answers you need <p> As you can see determining the suitability of a particular application is a complicated process which takes into account several specific factors . For this reason application testing is an essential part of the decision-making process . We will be happy to arrange a test for product and defect suitability and will provide you with throughput parameters of their machines with respect to your application . We can also help design customized product handling systems and can recommend appropriate reject mechanisms for your application . <p> Summary <p> X-ray food inspection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a tool for reducing levels of all types of contaminants from merely undesirable to potentially dangerous X-ray inspection provides excellent quality control assurances able to reduce costs and potential liability . <p> About Safeline <p> Since its formation in 1988 SAFELINE has become the largest metal detection manufacturer in the world with operations in the U.K. U.S.A. and Europe with over 30 years of design and manufacturing experience supporting a worldwide distribution network . <p> You will find SAFELINE metal detectors reliably and effectively eliminating all types of metal contamination from foods destined for the global marketplace . <p> This content is sponsored by the supplier .

@@22940995 @2940995/ <p> As a distributor for Lipton iced tea from 1993 to 1998 , the Swiss bottled water giant Henniez S.A. helped Switzerland achieve the highest per capita iced tea consumption rate in the entire world . <p> Along the way , Henniez , named for the small village in which it is headquartered , realized that if iced tea was so popular in Switzerland , it should be more profitable to bottle it , rather than simply distributing it . Henniez planned to convince Lipton to extend its contract to bottling the tea , along with distributing it . <p> The company also decided that its iced tea should not be subjected to pasteurization because it felt the prolonged exposure to heat would damage taste . The Lipton product distributed by Henniez had been cold-filled into a returnable bottle of polyethylene terephthalate and pasteurized to make it shelf stable . <p> Hot-filled PET was never an option , either , says director of technology and production Pascal Rouge . " Margins on tea are small , so you have to be very competitive , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand the heat , are just too expensive . " <p> Ambient filling of PET on an aseptic filler , on the other hand , permits a bottle to be as light as a carbonated soft-drink bottle . It also minimizes the length of time during which product is exposed to heat , which means flavor can be maintained at its peak . So Rouge and colleagues decided early on that aseptic packaging was the way to go . <p> But which aseptic system ? Minimal space was available , which did n't bode well because many of the aseptic PET filling systems available then and now require considerable square footage . They also involve , says Rouge , a level of complexity that Henniez wanted to avoid . The complexity Rouge refers to is the " clean room " quality that is a prerequisite to some of today 's commercially available aseptic filling systems . Class 100 or 1O sterility , large areas that must be overpressured , employees who must wear clean gowns and sanitize themselves each time they enter the filling area--these were all the options that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Not that easy ' <p> " It 's not that easy to say , okay , let 's build an aseptic room and put a filler in it , " says Rouge . " We were n't used to working that way , not only at the management level but also the people who work with the machines . In addition , the investment would have been much higher for an aseptic-room approach . " <p> So Henniez formed a relationship with Tetra Pak Plastic Ltd . ( Geneva , Switzerland ) , just then developing a linear aseptic bottle filler whose most distinguishing feature is its small footprint . Measuring 8x3 m ( 26'x10 ' ) , the machine is capable of running 11/2-L bottles at 83/min . Fed by a tubular heat exchanger for the thermal processing of the tea and an in-line blow molder , the integrated line provides blowing , sterilizing , filling , capping , labeling , multipacking and palletizing . <p> Included in the line is one of Tetra Pak 's first X-6 stretch blow-molding machines . The Tetra Plast(TM) LFA-8 filler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a built-in sterile chamber that eliminates the need to locate the line in a costly and complicated clean-room environment . So the filler sits on the plant floor like any other piece of equipment . <p> Sterility is no less important than in any other aseptic filling operation . But , says Rouge , the Tetra Pak system delivers it in a clever way that requires no clean rooms or pharmaceutical-style garb . It let 's a beverage plant be a beverage plant , he says . <p> By 1997 , Henniez committed itself to Tetra Pak 's aseptic filling concept and contracted with Tetra for a system ready for commercial production in early ' 99 . But a funny thing happened on the way to commercialization . Also in 1997 , Henniez 's contract with Lipton was terminated . Fortunately , another Henniez contract , for Virgin Cola in PET bottles , was signed in April ' 98 . This relationship with England-based Virgin paved the way for Henniez to seek Virgin 's permission for Henniez to market iced tea under the high-flying Virgin brand . In return Henniez pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1/2- and 11/2-L aseptically filled PET bottles was launched last January . <p> The Virgin connection was important because it gave Henniez a brand that was already a well- known entity . Advertising and promoting such a brand can be done effectively at far less cost than it would take to create and promote an entirely new brand . <p> Blending is first <p> The first steps in the Henniez operation are product blending and then sterilization in the tubular heat exchanger . There 's also bottle blow-molding , done on the X-6 machine . PET preforms , also supplied by Tetra Pak from its plant in Belgium , are dumped into a large floor-level hopper and then elevated along a track that eventually drops down into the infeed of the blow-molding machine . Preforms are placed upside down six-across on transport mandrels that move slowly past heating lamps . When the preforms exit the heating section , they 're conveyed at a right angle in groups of six and enclosed in the six blow molds for blowing under 37 bar of pressure . <p> When the molds open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device that grips bottles by the necks and deposits them right-side-up on a discharge conveyor . This conveyor moves off at a right angle in the direction of the filler . <p> At the entrance of the filler , line pressure and stainless-steel lane guides divide the bottles into eight lanes . A transfer mechanism picks eight bottles by the sidewalls from the infeed conveyor and transfers them , upside down , to a shuttle unit that grips each of the eight bottles by its neck ring . This shuttle strokes forward and hands the bottles off to another eight-up tool that uprights the bottles and hands them off to the tool that takes them through warming , sterilizing , filling and capping . All four of these activities occur inside the machine 's inner chamber . To enter this chamber , bottles pass through an " airlock , " where overpressurized sterile air is blown downward to keep ambient air out of the sterile chamber . <p> Prior to filling , the intermittent-motion machine stops the bottles at three stations . In the first , hot air is blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 212-F ) . This accomplishes two objectives : Warming the bottles prevents condensation from forming on the inside , and the 25% hydrogen peroxide sterilizing solution works optimally under these conditions . <p> In the second station within the filler 's sterile chamber , a mist of hydrogen peroxide is blown in to sterilize the bottles . And in the third station , hot air is blown in to evaporate the hydrogen peroxide . <p> The sterile bottles move next beneath eight magnetic flow-meter nozzles . These nozzles do not touch the bottles . Filled bottles move next to a station where a roll-fed foil lamination is heat-sealed to each bottle finish and die-cut . The foil lamination is pre-sterilized with hydrogen peroxide in much the same manner as the bottles . <p> This complex foil structure was developed with considerable help from Sonoco ( Hartsville , SC ) , and Tetra Pak considers it proprietary . Henniez is the first bottler to use the material . <p> According to Tetra Pak 's Pierre Huser , technical project manager , the material has to incorporate a number of important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , the heat-seal layer that contacts the bottle finish must be compatible with PET . And , while seal integrity is critical so that leaks can be prevented , the consumer wants the foil membrane to peel off easily and completely without having bits of the liner stuck to the bottle finish . <p> Without describing the seven-layer foil lamination in complete detail , Huser does say that the heat-seal layer is a thin layer of polyester . Foil is somewhere in the middle . Also included is what Huser describes as a " PET foam " that helps the thin heat-seal layer conform to any minute irregularities in the neck finish . <p> Once the liner is sealed onto the bottle finish , the bottles can be released from the sterile chamber . This is done by a pick-off mechanism that grips bottles and places them onto a discharge conveyor belt . As they depart the sterile chamber , bottles pass through an air-lock station much like at the infeed . <p> The compact 26'x10 ' footprint of the aseptic filler , from infeed to discharge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers , says Rouge . Currently , one shift can handle Henniez 's volume . Should that change , as Rouge expects it to , Henniez will add shifts to take care of the added volume . <p> When the plant needs to change bottle sizes , changeover of the filler takes less than two hours , says Rouge . The firm typically runs each size for about a week before making a change . <p> Lined TE closure <p> A rotary capper from Zalkin , represented in the U.S. by Fowler Products ( Athens , GA ) , sits a few feet from the discharge of the filling machine . The 38-mm injection-molded polypropylene closures with tamper-evident drop-down band are supplied by French manufacturer Bericap , represented in the U.S. by Bericap North America ( Burlington , Ontario , Canada ) . Inside the cap is a liner of ethylene vinyl acetate that provides a leak-resistant seal for when the consumer recloses the bottle after removing the inner seal . <p> Labels are applied on a Krones ( Franklin , WI ) Canmatic hot glue labeler . Henniez converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four colors . Next , an inspection unit from elettroimpianti ( Rubbiano , Italy ) relies on radio frequency to check fill-level accuracy and photocells to check label and cap presence . It rejects any bottle with improper fill level or missing cap or label . <p> Bottles pass an ink-jet coder from Wilux Print ( Bubikon , Switzerland ) that prints production time and date as well as sell-by date . At the outset , a conservative six-month sell-by date was imprinted on the sidewall of each cap . " But we knew we would be able to extend it , which we now are doing , " says Rouge . " We 'll soon move to nine months , and we may go even longer at some future date . " <p> Individual bottles are grouped and shrink-bundled in a machine made by the Itain manufacturer SMI , represented in North America by Francis W. Harkness ( Vaudreuil-Dorion , Quebec , Canada ) . The 11/2-L bottles are in unsupported film , six bottles per bundle . The smaller bottles , however , are bundled in either six- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray that 's automatically formed from a blank by the SMI machine . The tray is printed flexo in three colors by Model Emballages ( Moudon , Switzerland ) . The six-count bundles use unsupported film . Separately , they are loaded manually into a corrugated tray and sent through an off-line shrink-film wrapper and tunnel . <p> For six-packs of 11/2-L bottles , a Twin Pack ( Maiano , Italy ) machine applies handles by heat-sealing them to the shrink-wrapped bundles . The last piece of equipment in the line is a palletizer/stretch wrapper from Berchi ( Parma , Italy ) . Layers of shrink-wrapped bundles are collated and then lifted onto a pallet . When the proper number of layers are on the pallet , a powered roller conveyor moves the pallet into the Berchi stretch wrapper . Then the wrapped pallet moves on powered roller conveyors to a lift mechanism that takes pallets to the warehouse . <p> Now that the first two bottle sizes have been mastered by Henniez , a 33-mL bottle is in the works . Henniez is also intrigued by Tetra Pak 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch blow-molding machine can be modified to blow mold preforms that incorporate a barrier layer , says Rouge , Henniez would look seriously at bottling fruit-based beverages in addition to teas . <p> With or without this expanded capability , says Rouge , Henniez is excited about its new aseptic PET capability . He readily admits there were hurdles at the outset , but nothing out of the ordinary . And , as he puts it , " If we had to choose a system tomorrow , we 'd choose the same one . "

Written specifically from a packaging perspectiveLearn more &gt;&gt; <p> Article September 30 , 1996 <h> Expanding the scope of the operator <p> With computer and technological advances , the role of the packaging machinery operator continues to evolve as the year 2000 nears . Flexibility is key . <p> A fault light on a control panel flashes red . A machine operator 's quick glance tells her that the fill level on nozzle 9 has fallen 0.1 oz short of the acceptable range for six straight fills . Should the machine be shut down for repair , or can an adjustment via the touchscreen of the PLC-controlled filler resolve the problem ? The operator opts for the latter course and finds the problem is solved easily enough . She then uses the touchscreen to signal a downstream diverter at the case packer to remove the six bottles with wrong fills . She also types in an explanatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be aware of the possible need for corrective action , and so that the line 's real-time data acquisition system will not only record that the problem occurred but what steps were taken to correct it and who took them . Welcome to the world of the packaging machinery operator in the year 2000 . Fast disappearing are the days when the operator could afford to focus only on the single machine for which he or she had responsibility . Today , and increasingly in the future , machines are parts of seamless systems networked together mechanically and electronically . In such an environment , operators will have to be able to communicate clearly with their counterparts in the line , from uncasing to filling to palletizing to the warehouse itself . Employers , too , will have to communicate more effectively with their employees . At least that 's what our interviews of industry experts revealed . Helen Gleason , packaging specialist for Clearwater , FL-based Management Recruiters , is one who sees a trend toward better overall lines of communication between employer and employee . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , where it 's very proactive versus reactive , " says Gleason . " I see a process of total involvement of the hourly employee and the salaried employee in the manufacturing operation , a delegation of responsibility to hourly employees to make them feel part of and proud of the manufacturing , as opposed to saying ' This is your job . You do it . ' Without an understanding of why they 're doing it . " As an example of this " total involvement " approach , Gleason cites certain converting companies , a corrugated case maker for example , that encourage their machine operators to visit the customer plant where the case actually gets used . " Very often , " says Gleason , " you 'll find there 's a good interchange of ideas . " Operator as stakeholder Gleason 's not the only one who believes in the value of making employees believe they are stakeholders in the business . " The best packaging machinery operators will be able to develop a sense of ownership about what they 're doing , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who asked not to be identified . So here 's the analogy : Teach a man to make a box and you have a box maker . But teach a man why he 's making a box , and you will have a better box maker . Empowering the operator with a sense of self-worth and confidence may be the basis for a proactive employee , one not afraid to share information with fellow employees , and with the confidence to " think on his feet . " Mark Niemiec , director of packaging at Camden , NJ-based Campbell Soup Co. , elaborates . " The operator will need to know how to work as part of a team . It used to be that the person operating a packaging machine did n't have to be concerned with the warehousing operation , for example . Today and tomorrow , I believe that these things will have to be interconnected . Because if the primary or secondary package does n't meet performance requirements , it can have a significant impact throughout the warehousing system , both internally and out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The confidence of the operator then , is only the beginning . In order to communicate with fellow employees , packaging machinery operators must have an understanding of what their coworkers ' jobs entail , as well as having an understanding of the machines they deal with . Jay Hooper , instructor at Guilford Technical College , Jamestown , NC , says he sees the change already in place . " People basically want their employees to know more practical things than ever before , " he says . " It used to be enough to have someone who was willing and able to show up so he/she could be trained on the job . Today , companies want a far greater knowledge level . " If I had to quantify , " he goes on , " I see about a half a school grade increase needed by the industry each year . " Bob Testin , Clemson University , Clemson , SC , agrees : " Certainly , by the year 2000 , a two-year technical degree or diploma of some kind will be required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fly with these machines now being **25;227;TOOLONG , much faster , and more sophisticated . The two-year technical schools have a gold mine of opportunity in terms of industry needs . " Internships and co-ops were also mentioned in Packaging World 's series of interviews as being an important asset to an entry-level employee . Yet some think that it 's not a need for more education , but a need to refocus . Says Glenn Davis , director of technical education at Arlington , VA-based Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute : " I would n't say the knowledge level needed by an operator has gone up . I 'd say it 's changed . In large part , the change is due to the influx of electronics that now operate and control equipment . " The multi-skilled operator While viewpoints vary on how much formal training or education will be required in the future , one thing is for sure : The role of the machine operator is definitely changing . It 's clear that the operator 's vision must be broader so that he or she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , if you could load a cartoner with carton blanks , you were okay , " says Bob Geer , director of production at Glaxo Wellcome Pharmaceuticals , Research Triangle Park , NC . " Now and in the future , we 'll need operators to know when a piece of equipment is n't quite right and then , rather than immediately calling the mechanic , be able to jump in and fix it . " He goes on to mention a concept echoed by a number of people surveyed . " The operator will have to bring in some of the skills of the mechanic . " Geer is not alone is his acknowledgement that the duties of mechanic and operator overlap . " If I were running an operation , " says Testin of Clemson , " I 'd like the operator and mechanic to be interchangeable . " Are the two positions melding ? Perhaps . Or maybe it 's just that as the mechanic becomes more specialized in computer skills and other responsibilities formerly considered the exclusive territory of the packaging engineer , the operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic . Training those already hired It 's easy enough to hire an entry-level operator with a certificate from a technical college , but how do you improve the knowledge of operators already employed ? One answer would be to have them read manuals on new machinery . But as anyone who has purchased a home computer and then tried to plow through the user manuals that come with it can tell you , that 's no easy task . Enter the technical writer . Says Robert Woelfling , project design engineer at Hershey Chocolate , Hershey , PA , : " We are currently paying teams of hourly employees to develop training programs for operators and maintenance personnel . Most of their time is spent extracting information from technical manuals and rewriting it in a format that is appropriate for their coworkers . " Among the skills cited as crucial are a general electronics knowledge , as well as a call for math skills , so that operators can properly work with statistical process control quality programs . The majority of those asked also said that having computer skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important in the year 2000 . " Operators now have to be more sophisticated in the use of controls , PLCs and computers , " says PMMI 's Davis . " But by the same token , one operator may now be controlling two fast machines in place of formerly being responsible for only one slower machine . " Davis and others we interviewed were quick to observe that the menial tasks that operators used to be involved with are disappearing . As these tasks perform their disappearing act , and as more and more automation moves in instead , it will be important for the packaging machinery operators of the future to resist the temptation to view their jobs as being less important than they once were . Sure , it 's true that complex changeovers that once took hours are now being accomplished at the touch of a button . But as advances in technology eliminate one set of tasks for which the machine operator traditionally was responsible , that same technology will cause the role of the operator to evolve into something newer and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the entire line . It will mean more data management , more troubleshooting , more decision making , more thinking . Upper management had better be ready for these changes , too . Managers will have to be able to stimulate the packaging machinery operator of the future in new ways . Managers will also have to be receptive to ideas percolating up from the plant floor . Otherwise the Suggestion Box will stay empty , and the company 's efficiency will suffer . Though much remains unclear , one attribute about the packaging machinery operators of the future seems definite . They can not afford to be people about whom those immortal words from the movie " Cool Hand Luke " can ever be said : " What we have here is a failure to communicate . "

This has been mandated in France since Jan. 2011 , and all other European countries must be in compliance by 2017 ( except for Belgium , Greece , and Italy , which have until 2023 ) . Canada and Korea are slated to roll out by 2012 , while India has already put this into practice. - <p> Step 2 : Identification at the pack level ( mass serialization at unit level ) with a serial number assigned to each pack .

This level is being used in Italy , Greece , and Brazil , and it 's mainly implemented to fight tax and reimbursement frauds . One of the benefits of this system is the ability to use the serial number in the database to investigate a product after delivery .

The second part is the verification of pharmaceuticals at the point of dispensing through serial numbers .

What 's your view ? <p> John Herzig : I can only speak for myself , but in my case the degree from MSU 's packaging program could not have worked out better . One of the things you gain by graduating with a major in packaging is a breadth of technical knowledge that spreads across many disciplines " marketing , graphics , printing , operations , logistics , manufacturing .

No , I started in Mechanical Engineering and did n't switch to the Packaging Program until after my junior year . Fortunately , much of the course work that I took in the first three years I was able to apply toward my major in Packaging .

@@22941016 @2941016/ <p> The goal is to leverage brand equity and squeeze more revenue from their brand , package , and product development expenditures . For these brand owners , there is a need to ensure that global package executions strengthen the brand while avoiding creation of consumer confusion that over time undermines brand equity . Crucial to meeting this objective is ensuring that packages , both graphically and structurally , present a consistent image across all markets . <p> A well-thought out structural design that can be adapted globally unleashes the full power that a global brand possesses to support pan-regional brand strategies , increase consumer awareness , and build long-term brand value . Brand owners spend years and millions of dollars working to ensure that consumers immediately recognize their product and that there is no confusion with other brands , so consistency across regions is critical . <p> The following are proven approaches for developing and executing global package structures that embody the brand 's core DNA while addressing local needs . <p> Do the upfront work . The first steps should be to compile a list of package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to understand each market 's supply chain capabilities for filling and decorating secondary packaging and tertiary packaging . Next , identify the key package attributes that affect manufacturing and the distribution chain . These attributes , along with the key brand design cues , should serve as a starting point for developing package structures that minimize capital expenditure , as well as line changeovers . <p> This point can not be overemphasized for a company whose markets have varying abilities to fund new equipment and change parts for packaging lines . This approach will also minimize the structural modifications that might be necessary for the package to be compatible with other country or regional market needs , like pallet utilization , compatibility with vending machines , and fit into merchandising fixtures . Manufacturing line changeovers also reduce valuable line uptime , so it is of particular concern for operations that have tight capacity constraints . <p> Educate your structural designers about the package attributes that would be the primary drivers of local and regional modifications . As global designs are executed , inevitably there will be requests to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should identify areas where there can be some latitude to accommodate these requests , and they should be prepared to compromise in balancing functional needs and brand attributes . <p> Brand owners can create a family of structural designs with similar attributes , but that also include some features allowing distinction between brand variants . If package structures are developed with strong insight to manufacturing and the supply chain , distinct packages can be created whose differences are largely transparent to a packaging line . Methods for achieving this include molded features in areas that do n't interact with the packaging line and visual/tactile effects like embossing and etching . <p> Create brand guidelines . The creation of a document that spells out branding and design guardrails helps ensure consistent execution across the different regions of the world and clearly communicates the critical design cues which are off-limits to modification . <p> Disseminate this document widely to all stakeholders , including the R&amp;D , brand , procurement , design , commercialization , and quality teams " in short , anybody who has accountability for the brand 's shelf appearance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include time in commercialization timelines for adapting the global designs for local launch . There may be give and take in this process , and the designers should be included in the discussion for two reasons : 1 ) to efficiently arrive at a compromise , and thereby reduce re-design iterations , and 2 ) so the designers will gain a first-hand insight to the drivers of local adaptations . In my experience , a direct dialogue between the designers and local engineering teams usually leads to a swift compromise in which both parties feel their needs are being addressed . <p> In summary , the use of a package structural design approach that considers local needs from the beginning will result in less investment , faster time to market and greater on-shelf consistency for global brands . <p> About the Author : Steve Gibson is Senior Manager of Global Beverage Packaging R&amp;D at PepsiCo .

Learn more + <p> Glenroy invites you to download this playbook . <p> Article July 31 , 1997 <h> Cryogenic cooling of heat-set PET awaits patents <p> The technology 's not commercial yet , and it certainly has its skeptics . Test results show that thermal and barrier properties are enhanced significantly by blowing PET into heated molds and cooling with LN2 delivered by a unique new system . <p> Will cryogenic cooling become the next " hot " concept in molding polyethylene terephthalate containers ? Plastic Solutions Molding ( Plano , TX ) and a handful of partnering firms are betting the answer is yes . PSM 's chief executive officer Kurt Ruppman says his firm has applied for a patent on a method of stretch/blow molding monolayer PET preforms into heated molds then quickly chilling them with a mist of super-cold liquid nitrogen dispensed from the stretch rod . The resulting crystallinity in the PET bottle makes it capable of withstanding unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , claims Ruppman . One of PSM 's primary targets is the hot-fill beverage market currently served by PET bottles that undergo conventional heat-setting , i.e. , heated molds and either cool air or CO2 that is blown into the bottle . PSM believes its bottle , because it can be filled at 195-F to 200-F instead of 185-F , can deliver longer shelf life without added cost . For now , no applications of PSM 's technology are on the market . Ordinarily Packaging World would n't cover this topic until a package was commercialized . But PSM presentations at Bev-Pak Americas ' 96 and ' 97 , sponsored by Directions 21 Inc . ( Sarasota , FL ) , sparked considerable interest . Here 's a glimpse at what had conference attendees so intrigued . Part of their reaction , it should be observed , was skepticism . " That technology has been around for twenty years , " grumbled one plastics technology consultant , who objects to " the notion that it 's new or something that can be patented or licensed . " Says another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether the work is patentable . The patent office will make a determination on that . " Similar work in the 70s PSM certainly has had precursors in this area . In the 1970s , pioneers at Owens-Illinois ( Toledo , OH ) developed and patented methods of using LN2 and other agents to cool PET blown into heated molds . Essentially O-I 's process stopped the creation of spherulite crystals and encouraged long crystals . This produced PET bottles with superior thermal and barrier properties . By most accounts , these earlier efforts , while successful in the lab , never cleared the scale-up hurdle . Cost , technical complications , and the lack of a clear target in the marketplace are among the reasons cited . The timing was off , too , in that there were n't so many teas and fruit juices and isotonic beverages in single-serve bottles as there are today . PSM 's technology proceeds along lines similar to O-I 's . But Ruppman claims he 's done more than merely imitate prior art . " We 've created a whole different structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patent application is pending , full details on the process are only available to those who first sign a confidentiality agreement . According to Ruppman , those exposed to the technology , including a few Bev-Pak skeptics , " see the data they need to understand the change in morphology . " He 's referring to changes in the material 's molecular structure . The confidentiality agreement makes it difficult to pinpoint the mold and LN2 temperatures that are involved . But some who are close to the technology say that the gradient between hot mold temperature and cold LN2 temperature is what separates Ruppman 's work from those who came before him . " Hot molds and cooling with liquid nitrogen is not new , " says Peter Weggeman of Directions 21 . " But the extent to which he has gone in terms of very hot and very cold is new . " Some clues about the temperatures involved are available from Kees Killestijn of PETPower ( Etten-Leur , the Netherlands ) . He , too , is evaluating cryogenics , though he focuses on wide-mouth jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aggressively heat-setting the material , " says Killestijn in describing his work . " You have temperatures of plus 160-C 320-F outside and minus 140-C 284-F on the inside . So the total temperature gradient is 300 degrees . That 's where the unique crystallization comes in . " The closest thing to a commercial application of PSM 's technology is a hot-filled 64-oz bottle for Rio Red grapefruit juice , produced and marketed by Texas Citrus Exchange of Mission , TX . According to Pat Roberts , vice president of sales and marketing at Texas Citrus , this juice has been available in a conventional heat-set half-gallon PET bottle for about four years . Weighing 76 g empty , it 's filled at 180-F and has a six-month shelf life . In March , for package evaluation , Texas Citrus filled , at 195-F , capped and labeled 400 of PSM 's cryogenically cooled 64-oz bottles , each weighing 76 g empty . The higher fill temperature means better pasteurization , and , as Roberts puts it , " the more bacteria you kill , the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles through November , and then it will decide if a switch is in order . LN2 tough to control Among the reasons previous practitioners of cryogenic cooling never enjoyed commercial success is because super cold LN2 is expensive and extremely difficult to control . If it 's not carefully controlled , it can freeze valves and crack hoses . Enter BOC Gases ( Murray Hill , NJ ) , whose R&amp;D engineers and industrial cryogenics people engineered a computerized delivery system for the LN2 that permits pinpoint control of key parameters such as the nitrogen 's pressure , temperature , volume and timing of delivery . When Ruppman first approached BOC , he needed precisely this kind of process control capability , says Ron Lee , principal engineer in BOC 's R&amp;D department . " Our familiarity with cryogenic cooling of plastic auto fuel tanks , blown films , and other plastic items made us an obvious source for Ruppman , " says Lee . Within 18 months of first examining Ruppman 's technology , Lee recalls , he was convinced " the bottles were for real . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooling could be done controllably , and if we could make it possible to adjust the cooling conditions to specific targets , then we 'd have a viable process . " So BOC left the sidelines , where it had functioned as little more than a supplier of liquid nitrogen , and joined the game with PSM as a co-developer of the technology . The end result : a unique LN2 delivery system . The system BOC developed is also awaiting patent approval , so Lee is reluctant to describe it in great detail . But he emphasizes how " extraordinarily difficult " it is to consistently reproduce the precise cooling conditions required . " Liquid nitrogen can exist in a variety of thermodynamic states , " says Lee , " and these states are a function not only of temperature but other factors as well , including pressure and speed of delivery . In developing this delivery system , we did n't know exactly what thermodynamic state we needed . " So we had to come up with a system that would let us produce , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed us to lock in a particular state and return to it . Despite its considerable history in cryogenics , BOC was entering uncharted territory in its work with Ruppman . " In our other businesses , things like food , fuel tanks , films , it 's ultimately about cooling and little more , " Lee explains . " In this case , it 's about more than cooling . We 're stopping the growth of a certain kind of crystalline structure , a process so sensitive to the rate of heat transfer that we ca n't just put in a certain amount of cooling and say , ' There , we 've removed the heat . ' The requirements for this process are incredibly demanding . " Lee is well acquainted with prior art and previous patents , and he speculates that earlier practitioners of cryogenic cooling of stretch/ blow-molded PET bottles made a key mistake when they failed to bring in cryogenics experts . " They were top-notch people and companies , but cryogenics is a unique field , " says Lee . " There may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the liquid nitrogen . " Ruppman believes BOC 's control system is an indispensable component in his bottle-making technology . " They spent a lot of time on it , " says Ruppman , " and it required a period of time where we made a lot of bad bottles while necessary parameters were being explored . But it was something that had to be done . " More partners Two other PSM partners active in developing this technology are Electra Form ( Vandalia , OH ) and Ball Plastic Container ( Atlanta , GA ) . Electra Form custom modified its RSB-2000 reheat stretch/blow-molding machine-designed originally for conventional stretch/blow conditions-for PSM 's cryogenically cooled PET bottle . The two-cavity , intermittent-motion machine has a " racetrack " design that brings mandrel-mounted preforms past one bank of oven lamps , around a turn , and back into a second set of oven lamps before delivering preforms to the blow molds . The machine has a cycle time of 3.6 seconds , so cryogenically cooled bottles can be produced on the two-cavity machine at about 16/min . While that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be efficient for certain market segments-and at a fraction of the cost . The process of modifying an RSB-2000 for heat-setting purposes presented special challenges , primarily because the equipment must control extremely hot and cold temperatures in close proximity . Also , the BOC delivery system for LN2 had to be incorporated . From a blowing standpoint , the molds are electrically heated and zoned to allow variations in specific regions if the bottle requires them . Separate controls for sidewall and base were also critical , as Electra Form 's Larry Beres explained at Bev-Pak ' 97 in April . " One must separate , " Beres continued , " the hot and cold interface as much as possible to ensure the effectiveness of both . Shrinkage and metal tolerancing for these conditions are different from standard stretch blow molding , as is the residual shrinkage for the blown containers . All of these were painstakingly addressed and solved . A system for evacuating the gas quickly and efficiently , as well as sequencing for the process , required modifications to the normal parameters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models . Available in two- and four-cavity versions , they 're offered with conversion packages that permit rapid change from heat-setting conditions to standard stretch/blow . Strategies PSM 's plan is to first establish itself as a supplier of heat-set PET bottles with as many medium-output , intermittent-motion RSB-HT machines as demand requires . While PSM has no plans to get into high-speed rotary systems with its cryogenic cooling technology , that 's where Ball Plastic Container comes in . Already a sizeable PET bottle converter with three plants in operation and two more soon to open , Ball sees strong potential in producing heat-set PET bottles via cryogenic cooling . The firm has exclusive rights for five years to sublicense the PSM technology worldwide , except for Canada . " Ball is working diligently to become a technology leader in PET containers , " says Ball Plastic president Larry Green . " This technology provides some of that for us . " Ball 's interest in this technology is centered around three issues , says Green . " From a heat-set point of view , can you fill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , will these containers have sufficient barrier for things like carbonated soft drinks , picante sauces , or pickles ? " Ball 's first objective is to sell bottles it makes on an Electra Form system . " I 'd like to be selling bottles third quarter this year , " Green says . But the firm is also working with PSM and BOC on a method of incorporating cryogenic cooling on a multi-cavity rotary system . Some industry observers are skeptical that such a combination can be achieved . " It boggles the mind to think of a liquid nitrogen delivery system for a rotary machine , " says one technical management consultant who asked not to be identified . " When you go beyond one or two valving systems , you get yourself into one hell of a problem in timing , freezing , and precise dosing . It requires a rotary union system capable of dispensing the liquid nitrogen out to multiple molds through hoses , each of which must have its own valve . Just the wiring of such a system boggles the mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he acknowledges that distributing LN2 out to multiple molds under pinpoint control is indeed daunting . His response ? " We 're busy trying to prove it can be done . " And who would use the cryogenically cooled , hot-fillable bottles produced on a high-output rotary system ? Coca-Cola comes to mind-not for cold-filled carbonated soft drinks , but for hot-filled Fruitopia or Powerade . But all a Coke spokesman would say at present is , " We 've evaluated some bottles and saw some interesting things , but we 're still not sure how this technology applies to the Coke system . " How about cryogenic cooling for PET bottles containing oxygen-sensitive beer ? Would the O2 barrier suffice ? " We have a 20- to 30-percent increase in oxygen barrier compared to a heat-set PET bottle blown on a conventional system , " says Ruppman . " It 's been substantiated by independent labs and by Ball in conjunction with a major beverage company . The bottles had the same gram weight and were made of the same PET resin , too . " To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form 's Beres says several brewers have tested heat-set bottles produced by PSM and have seen enough to take the next step . " That means building a beer bottle , not a 64-oz hot-fill bottle designed for juice , " says Beres . " They need to know what the preform should look like , and how the blow mold can be optimized . I 'm not sure when those steps will be taken , but I think it 's going to happen pretty soon . " So there it is , a heat-setting technology about which industry observers are either enthusiastic or skeptical . Speculate , criticize or applaud as experts do , in the end this technology will be judged by the same relentless force that judges all packaging technologies : the marketplace . Perhaps Beres puts it best : " Promising though it is , technology is never enough . Now it 's a matter of getting the end users interested . "

However , an increasing number of consumers are now opting to purchase chocolate in specialist chocolatiers , which are gaining ground on **25;254;TOOLONG . Euromonitor International emphasises the large volume of high-quality Belgium chocolates currently being imported into Israel , which is driving even the non-premium local brands to start launching chocolates with higher cacao content . <p> Meanwhile , Algeria is an example of how improving economic conditions can result in higher consumer expenditure on indulgence products . With higher disposable incomes , Algerian parents are buying more chocolate for their children , particularly favouring the performance of products like chocolate with toys , seasonal chocolate and bagged selflines/softlines . Consequently , the brands benefiting the most from this trend include Kinder Surprise in chocolate with toys , and M&amp;M 's in bagged selflines/softlines . <p> Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 14% in 2007 in local currency terms . This rise is mostly the result of a trend towards premiumisation , and the increasing importance of ' gourmet versions ' within boxed chocolate assortments and tablets . Similarly , Euromonitor International 's research highlights the strong retail value performance of chocolate tablets in South Africa , which is expected to reach 12% in local currency terms at the end of 2007 . Sales are being driven by the increasing popularity of imported brands among middle and upper-class consumers . <p> Trading up from artisanal to industrially manufactured confectionery <p> Other than the strong performance of premium brands , regional growth in the confectionery market is being driven by the gradual consumer trade up from artisanal varieties to industrially produced offerings , which are mostly positioned within the economy and mid-price brackets . <p> One of the main examples of this trend is found in the Moroccan market , where retail confectionery sales are expected to grow by a healthy 6% in local currency terms in 2007 .

This applies particularly to Saudi Arabia and South Africa , where retail value sales are expected to grow in constant local currency terms by 35% and 16% respectively over 2007-2012 . The increasing focus on health and wellness products among middle-class consumers , however , may pose a threat to further growth in these countries in the longer term , and Euromonitor International highlights that manufacturers should start paying attention to this nascent issue . A number of schools in South Africa , for example , are banning sugar confectionery from school tuck shops , while trying to encourage healthier snack alternatives . <p> Other countries where chocolate confectionery is expected to grow strongly include Morocco , Cameroon and Nigeria , although these are all starting from a very low consumer base and are being pushed up by cheaper imports and low-priced local brands . <p> Sugar confectionery to maintain growth <p> Euromonitor International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by robust performances in countries such as Egypt and Morocco , where retail sales are expected to grow in constant value local currency terms by 16% and 15% respectively over the 2007-2012 period .

@@22941052 @2941052/ <h> The case of the compostable chip package-Part 2 <p> In the 6/11/10 Packaging Insights , the feature article discussed Frito-Lay 's launch of Sun Chips- in a compostable bag . The snack-foods giant recently returned all varieties except the original to conventional , non-compostable bags , a move providing lessons about sustainable packaging as a competitive strategy . <p> Full of sound and fury , signifying something <p> The sound refers to the noise made by the bags , the fury to consumer complaints about that noise . The significance of the association , however , supports this generalization : consumers are not willing to sacrifice for sustainable packaging . Any company that believes the contrary should disabuse itself of that belief . ( For related reading , see the 2/16/10 article : Green consumers : sustainability 's science fiction. ) - Frito-Lay could not have done a better job promoting the bag 's compostability , not with it being trumpeted front and back on the bag as well as on the company 's website . Regardless , sales reportedly fell more than 10% , too steep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety . On the surface , the partial pull-out seems odd , but Frito-Lay 's stated rationale is that the remaining variety represents the company 's commitment to the concept of a compostable bag. - Yes , but that decision might just represent principle over practicality . <p> For one thing , the bag has been lampooned widely , even inspiring a community on Facebook . The scaled-down use of the bag likely wo n't have a proportionately downward effect on such unwelcomed attention . Furthermore , marketing different varieties of the same brand in different packaging ( side-by-side , no less ) unquestionably invites comparisons of their respective decibels . Further yet , the compostable bag 's sound manifests as the consumer handles the bag in the store , thereby putting the consumer on notice , even if the full effect is n't experienced until one is eating from the bag. - So whereas the post-purchase experience might hurt repeat purchases , the in-store experience might hurt trial purchases . And that 's counter to a fundamental function of packaging : to be a point-of-purchase inducer. - Frito-Lay underestimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overestimated its ability to deflect that reaction. - Frito-Lay addressed the noise issue on the bag and website and now on in-store displays , in attempts to convince consumers that the environmental benefits are worth the consumers ' tolerance. - - The attempts , however , are not consistent . On the bag and website , for example , the reason given for the noise is , " because it is compostable . " A problem with that claim is that it could be interpreted as saying that loudness is an inherent trait of compostability , which is not true . On the in-store displays , the reason given for the noise is , " that 's what change sounds like . " - Loudness is not an inherent trait of compostability either , and from a consumer 's perspective , the issue is not whether something represents change but whether the change is for the better . On the other hand , had Frito-Lay been consistent and forthright and explained the loudness as the consequence of the bag 's molecular structure , it likely would not have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer to sacrifice . <p> In launching the bag despite its loudness , Frito-Lay exposed its flanks , and so far , at least one competitor has launched a compostable chip bag that 's promoted as being less loud . How far companies will pursue sound as a differentiator remains to be seen . One would think that petroleum-based bags would be the benchmark . Then again , now that the door has been opened , there soon might be promotional claims lauding a particular composition as being not only more sustainable than a petroleum-based bag but quieter , too . <p> Was anything learned about compostability ? <p> The ruckus over sound subtracted from what otherwise might have been learned about consumers ' attitudes about compostability and its viability as a component of a sustainable packaging strategy . Compared to recycling , composting has a far less developed infrastructure and requires more effort from the consumer . If the Sun Chips- bag had been quieter , would a sizable segment of consumers have embraced the bag for its compostability ? The short , muddled history of the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that key question. - - - Regarding compostable chip bags , compositions that are either currently commercialized or awaiting launch include those sourced from corn , potatoes , and wood . It might be a matter of when , rather than if , the respective companies start competing on the basis of the source material . Whereas all are compostable , would one decompose quicker than the others if they end up in a landfill or as litter ? Whereas all are compostable , would one sourced from a food crop be more subject to criticism than one sourced from a non-food crop ? Before companies start splitting sustainability hairs , they should have reliable assurances that enough consumers give a darn. - One derives those assurances in large portion through research . Unfortunately , some companies , fearful of a competitive disadvantage , forego research and rely on assumption and hope . Just as bad are companies that conduct research that yields conveniently confirming results . A true example occurred during a focus group on sustainable packaging in which the moderator gave an introductory speech praising environmental stewardship as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced some of the responses to questions about whether the participants would be willing to make certain sacrifices in the name of sustainability . <p> A lot at stake <p> Frito-Lay has much to consider as it develops the replacement for the Sun Chips- bag , and replace it , it must . The company has publicly announced that intention. - Additionally , there 's the one variety remaining in the compostable bag . And if that fact serves as a reminder of the company 's commitment to a compostable bag , it equally serves as a reminder that the company did not get it right the first time . So the clock is ticking and in the interim other companies are making their own forays into the realm. - What Frito-Lay ultimately does will have ramifications that extend beyond the snack foods category , onto the much larger category of flexible packaging . Maybe the replacement will bear little resemblance to its predecessor . It 's not improbable , for sustainable packaging is , after all , a mixed bag. - -

" The installation of a rotary filler and capper on our clumping cat litter jug line has more than doubled our production rate , while reducing our labor costs by nearly half , " says Mark Teixeira , plant engineer . " And it 's reduced giveaway weight by a staggering amount . " CF Packaging Machinery ( Marietta , GA ) provided MFM with an All-Fill ( Exton , PA ) Cerebus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CB 104 capper from Eastern Machine ( Westminster , MD ) , and a pressure-sensitive labeler from Auto Labe ( Ft . Pierce , FL ) . New conveying equipment from A.I.S. Container Handling ( Dutton , MI ) , and a Styrotech ( Raleigh , NC ) sleeve labeler also contribute to MFM 's new-found efficiency . The machinery has allowed MFM to get new product to retail . In the past , sales were limited to one offering in three sizes : a 1-gal " milk " jug , and 1- and 2.5-gal F-style containers . Today , litter is sold in the same sizes , but now eight individual varieties are offered , under MFM 's Cedar Fresh- and Litter Guard- brand names . Approximately 60% of the company 's business , however , is for private-label products . All cat litter is filled into extrusion blow-molded high-density polyethylene jugs from various suppliers . " This product line has allowed us to triple our average monthly sales of product within this particular segment , " says Jack Hollrah , senior vice president , marketing and sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company . " The segment of the market served by this equipment is the newer , high-end clumping cat litter , " notes Mike Wilkinson , president . " Cat litter in this segment retails between $5 and $7 for a nine-quart jug . " Blending , giveaway problems Prior to automating the jug line at its Lowell , FL , plant in May , ' 94 , litter was filled semi-automatically . Containers were manually placed on a stand , beneath two sets of six nozzles . Each nozzle had a two-position on/off valve . Containers vibrated on the stand during filling , while caps were applied manually . The process left a lot to be desired . " We had two men loading jugs under spouts , two filling the jugs and another man applying caps , " recalls Teixeira . " Our line leader was responsible for many tasks , including preparing the additive or scent we blend with our litter mixtures . The scent was added via a vibratory feeder and we really did n't have a good handle on accuracy . Sometimes we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . " When you put in too much , the litter loses some of its clumping ability because the crystals are so dense . They 're also expensive , so we do n't want to overfill . Conversely , if we do n't add enough , there 's no scent value and the appearance of the product is poor , " he adds . " The filler has given us better control of our blending process , allowing us to introduce new product , " notes Rufus Williams , manager of MFM 's packaging department . " This was previously unattainable . " In the past , differences in density resulted in segregation between scent crystals and the litter . Therefore , MFM felt the product was n't marketable . The dual-auger filling system now in place provides a blend that MFM is proud to stack against the competition . While additive blending was problematic , giveaway was nightmarish . " Operators would just fill the containers up all the way , " Teixeira notes . " The more the jug was left on the filling stand to vibrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another economic concern for MFM prior to automating . Besides the five operators handling filling and capping , one person served as overall line leader and prepared scents or additives , one assisted with labeling and case packing , two erected shipping cases , one loaded jugs into cases , and another stacked cases on pallets . Automating benefits By automating the line , MFM now needs only five or six people : one to unload jugs , another to stack them on the line , one to case pack , two to erect cases , and sometimes a sixth to help erect cases and assist at various points along the line . " Case erecting is our most labor-intensive process , and we plan to automate that this year , " Teixeira notes . MFM wo n't divulge financial numbers from this reduction in labor , but Teixeira estimates payback in less than two years . Going ' on-line ' MFM 's Lowell plant mills the white clay into a powder that is trucked about six miles from the company 's 720-acre mine in Fairfield , FL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant has undergone considerable structural improvements to upgrade its efficiency . One of these improvements is a mezannine section that holds large storage tanks of the powdered litter absorbent . The litter is gravity-fed to two stainless-steel twin-auger fill heads that are part of the All-Fill Cerebus II system . A plenum subdivides each fill head into two sections , one for the absorbent litter , the second for an additive or fragrance . An auger within each of these four sections rotates , with the proper mix of absorbent and additive collecting on a spinner plate below . The blended product descends through two collector funnels , one underneath each of the two fill heads . From these two funnels , product continues into each of 16 transfer funnels , held in place on a rotating turret assembly . Jugs index single-file into the indexing rotary turret assembly . Adjustable guide rails on the conveyor keep the jugs properly oriented . The rotary filling system uses two separate variable-speed vibrators to ease filling . The first , mounted at the rear of the turret , vibrates a rail along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of product . Another motor is mounted below the container carriage to vibrate the indexing jugs . Each jug passes through 16 positions on the turret . The infeed of the bottle into the machine is considered the first position . At the second position , the transfer funnel above discharges half the fill required to fill that particular jug . For size changeovers , MFM manually replaces a nylon nozzle , or adapter , to accommodate a different jug size . For example , a longer , thinner nozzle is used for the " milk " jugs . The jugs continue to vibrate as they pass the third and fourth position . This helps settle product and allow room for the second stage of the fill at the fifth position . The filled jugs vibrate through the remainder of the positions until they 're discharged at position 16 . Computer control As filled jugs discharge from the machine , a powered infeed conveyor moves them one at a time to the All-Fill MW-16 checkweigher . The jugs are spaced at specific intervals to help provide accurate weight measurements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications port . The jug weight is noted by the checkweigher and sent to the Cerebus II controls of the filler . During setup of the Cerebus II , target weight tolerances are entered . Based on that information , the checkweigher and Cerebus II communicate overweights , underweights , or jugs within tolerance . Feedback signals from the checkweigher to the Cerebus II are used to adjust filling revolutions within both fill heads to maintain fills within the specified weight tolerances . Capping flexibility Jugs within tolerance index to the Eastern Machine CB-Series straight-line capper . The injection-molded polypropylene caps come in colors to match specific product labels . Neck finishes are 53 mm for the 1- and 2.5-gal F-style jugs ; 38 mm for the " milk " jug . An automatic supply hopper feeds the linerless , short-skirt caps into a vibratory cap feeder that orients and delivers the caps in proper position for the cap chute . At the bottom of this chute , the cap is pulled by the jug as it makes contact with the leading edge of the cap . At the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap onto the neck of the jug . At three subsequent stations , the caps are tightened by the spinning action of the spindle rollers . Jugs are held by gripper belts during the process . Rollers are adjustable for torque control . They also may be adjusted for different cap sizes , as can side gripper belts . A height adjustment permits MRM to raise and lower the capper to accommodate different conveyor heights . Labeling advances Capped jugs continue to labeling equipment . For the 1-gal " milk " jugs , MRM relies on two Auto Labe 130 blow-on pressure-sensitive labelers to apply labels to two primary panels . " In the past , we used pressure-sensitive labelers , but they were wipe-on machines , " explains Teixeira . " There 's nothing wrong with wipe-on labelers , but with our extremely dusty environment , that dust would get on the jugs and when the label was applied , it caused the label to slip and go on crooked . The equipment was inappropriate for our needs , and we ended up wasting material . With these blow-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much greater accuracy . " For F-style containers , MFM applies a sleeve label . Until this Fall , MFM purchased pre-sleeved containers . But with sales increasing , and more product varieties to sell , nearly 10O sq ft of warehouse space was used to store the prelabeled jugs . " As our business has picked up , we decided to apply the low-density polyethylene labels in-house , " relates Teixeira . " We purchased a Styrotech ST-2200 and now we no longer have to order large quantities and eat up valuable warehouse space . Instead , we can label jugs on a just-in-time basis . "

@@22941106 @2941106/ <h> Will Google glasses play a role in packaging ? <p> Keith Campbell , a Packaging World Contributing Editor and On the Edge blogger , took in the sights and sounds of Dusseldorf this past May to bring us a series of reports on new developments in the packaging controls and automation space being shown at interpack 2014 . In case you missed his written , blogged , or podcast contributions , here are a few highlights . <p> Google glasses made their first interpack appearance . No claims were being made about readiness for implementation , but process supplier AZO and technology supplier Beckhoff were able to demonstrate the concept of how these glasses could be used for production monitoring and as an HMI to actually interact with the manufacturing process . One application talked about was using the Google glasses to download maintenance information in a hands-free way to a technician . A step in that direction is the use of QR codes that can be scanned with a technician 's smart phone or tablet , resulting in a download of technical details . <p> The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the use of purpose-built integrated robots , where instead of interfacing a robot from , say , Fanuc or ABB or Motoman , a machine builder designs and builds the mechanical mechanisms himself and implements kinematics software supplied by a controls vendor . The robot is no longer something that has to be supplied by a third party . Says Campbell : " My observation at this interpack was that there were about the same number of purpose-built robotic arms on display as there were integrated robotic arms . By next interpack , I would expect the integrated model to be the predominant one . While on the topic of robotics , I was surprised that I did n't find any collaborative robotics on the floor , with the exception of a university project on display in the VDMA booth . Collaborative robots are designed to work alongside people and may be deployed without guards or protective barriers around them .
