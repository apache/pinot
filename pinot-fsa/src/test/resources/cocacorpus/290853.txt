To be sure , sometimes we break the mold by our choices , even our sins . But ours is a God of great imagination and infinite surprises . He sometimes calls us out of the standard mold and into a new one . <p> The primary calling of God for all Christians is , of course , the call to salvation , followed by the call to obedience to his will as revealed in his Word .

The cost of infertility treatments runs into the tens of thousands of dollars , and even if we had no ethical concerns about creating and storing human embryos ( which we do ) , we would not be able to justify the expenditure of so many resources ( even if covered by insurance ) to produce children , especially given that so many children are already awaiting adoptive homes . Over 400,000 children in 2014 were in foster care , with nearly half of these not expected to return to their biological families .

Yet , my strong convictions assured me that I was not called to do likewise . <p> So we explored adoption . But while we were working through the housing , financial and work complexities that presented obstacles , God prompted us in other directions of ministry and work that seemed to keep adoption out of reach .

" We have experienced a long and hostile election season that has divided the nation , sullied friendships , and even strained family relationships . Though we do n't  yet know the full implications of this election for the future of our nation , there is one thing we can be confident of as Christians : In the midst of uncertainty and hostility , the Bible calls us to pray . So , here are four post-election prayers for Christians . <p> Pray for our new leaders . Regardless of your politics , the Bible commands us to pray for our political leaders .

" Pray that God would enable us to live at peace with one another . Where there are broken relationships or strained connections , let 's ask that he restore civility for the sake of our communities . <p> Pray for our hearts . The turmoil of the election season has revealed fissures in our own hearts . As the psalmist requests in Psalm 139:23-24 , " Search me , God , and know my heart ; test me and know my concerns .

Let 's pray for him to bring these to light so that his Spirit can work to make us more like Jesus . <p> Pray for our churches . This election creates a fresh opportunity for our churches to serve our communities and share the gospel . As Paul says in Ephesians 6:19 , " Pray also for me , that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel . " The ability for our churches to thrive depends on the restoration of the unity of the Spirit , so we should pray to that end . We should also pray for our churches to be protected from religious liberty restrictions that would prevent them from carrying out our mission . <p> Praying is the most powerful way we can respond in these days .

But for many , its one of the most painful days of the year , too . Perhaps we 've lost our mother , or our mother was n't what we needed her to be .

In many of the psalms , we see Davids honest groans , because the pain in his heart is more than he can bear alone . <p> " O Lord , all my longing is before you ; my sighing is not hidden from you . " Psa . 38:9 <p> " Turn to me and be gracious to me , for I am lonely and afflicted . The troubles of my heart are enlarged ; bring me out of my distresses . " Psa . 25:16-17 <p> " How long , O LORD ? Will you forget me forever ? How long will you hide your face from me ? How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of your heart . Cry out to him . Do n't  hold back in your sorrow or your suffering . Prayer is one of the greatest gifts , because it allows us to pour our weary souls into the hands of our Savior . You do n't  have to clean yourself up before you pray ; you can come to him upset , crying , frustrated and sad . Tears give emotion a way out , and the Scripture informs our emotions of truth . These two go hand-in-hand as we journey through lifes difficult paths . <p> 2 . Surround yourself with people who love you : Do n't  walk through this day alone . Let close friends and family know that Mothers Day is difficult . Its okay to ask for help and tell others that you 're hurting . People do n't  often know you 're hurting unless you tell them . Allow the church to wrap around you and care for your soul . Invite tender and gentle people to share in your sufferings , to love you , listen to you , sit with you while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need most is a hug , a listening ear , and a shoulder to cry on . It might feel difficult or uncomfortable to allow people into your grief , but the Lord gave us community for a reason .

Childlessness can be all-consuming . But if you 're a Christian , the core of your identity is rooted in Christ . <p> 3 . Stay off social media : Social media has a way of stirring up discontentment and dissatisfaction . This is especially true on a day that vividly reminds you of what you lack . Your soul will benefit greatly from a break and a breath of fresh air . Consider pushing pause on your phone for the day or even the weekend .

Its better to err on the side of caution than to find yourself in the midst of a breakdown because you 've seen one too many posts about babies . <p> 4 . Childlessness does not define you : Its easy to feel like your lack of children defines you . Childlessness can be all-consuming . But if you 're a Christian , the core of your identity is rooted in Christ , not in your ability to bear babies . Fix your eyes on him , and allow your soul to be saturated in your true identity . Being Gods child should be the primary thing that defines the childless . Its okay to grieve over the unfulfilled desire , but do so in a way that shows that your ultimate hope , joy and satisfaction is found in being Gods child , not having your own child . <p> And pastors , as you preach on Mothers Day , please do n't  forget the childless in your congregation . Most of life is bittersweet ; we rejoice with those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is no different . You can be a healing balm for someones weary and wounded soul .

@@100509151 @4709151/ <h> Made for community : The church , marriage and dying to self <p> I recently took my son to see " The LEGO Batman Movie , " and I was struck by its depth . Batman teams up with LEGO to show , not just the dark side of Gotham Citys villains , but the dark side of the dark knight . The LEGO cartoons always seem to depict Batman in a unique way from the other superheroes : as the loner . He likes to work alone and is portrayed as emotionally distant , egotistical and self-preserving . He s afraid of being close or needing anybody in his life , especially emotionally . But by the end of the film , relationship and community trump individualism . Batman takes a long look inside himself and changes . <p> Individualism in America <p> Batman is one example of individualism . According to Britannica , individualism became a core part of American ideology by the 19th century . As James Bryce , British ambassador to the United States , wrote in The American Commonwealth in 1888 : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in personal freedom have been deemed by Americans not only their choicest , but their peculiar and exclusive possession . " <p> In her article for The Federalist , Heather Judd , traces back the history of individualism to the Enlightenment , where truth derived from reason and the self was exalted . Then , the Industrial Revolution centralized work in factories , which relied more on the individual for work instead of the family unit . Judd then brings the history to our present reality : <p> By the mid-nineteenth century , transcendentalists such as Emerson and Thoreau turned from rationalism but continued to extol the self-sufficiency of the individual . The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have dutifully followed the path they blazed , separating the individual from society , then family , and now even the self , as we question whether we have any inherent identity apart from our transitory desires and feelings . <p> Judd goes on to say that these historical shifts have brought our culture to a place where we navigate life from the perspective of the individual . These roots go down deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-government , for good reason . And more than that , our first father and mother sought independence from their Creator . But that 's not the calling our heavenly Father has for us spiritually . <p> Finding community in person <p> The New York Times op-ed columnist , Ross Douthat , says that the age of individualism will be sticking around , yet , he strikes at this innate desire we all carry inside of us , " The human desire for community and authority can not be permanently buried . . . . You only have to look at the place where millennialsand indeed , most of usare clearly seeking new forms of community today . That place is the online realm . " <p> God made us to commune with him personally and corporately as his people , which is why we long for community . <p> Its not wrong to seek community online , but we also need to seek community from fellow believers in our local churches ( Eph. 4:11-13 ) .

We cant walk this life in Christ on our own , because were part of a greater whole ( Rom. 12:5 ) . This is what our heavenly Father made us for : community and relationship . The Trinity is a striking example of communal relationship . God made us to commune with him personally and corporately as his people , which is why we long for community . And Jesus demonstrates that the only way to a flourishing relationship with the Father and others is through death to self ( John 12:24 ) . <p> Desiring relationship through marriage <p> Another way we see that were made for relationship is through marriage . Yet , we still take our cultural esteem for independence and autonomy into this one flesh union . In fact , individualism is often found flourishing in our homes .

I think this definition of unity is a great picture of community within the church and marriage . To have a musical harmony , there must be differing parts that come together ; each instrument or vocalist does their best individually for the benefit and beauty of the whole piece . <p> Likewise , I did n't  lose myself in a man when I got marriedthough I have changed in some ways .

When God brings diverse individuals together in the church through faith in Christ , and when he unites a sinful man and woman together in marriage , his glory is put on display , and we see a little bit more of his kingdom come , on earth as it is in heaven . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509152 @4709152/ <h> 4 biblical truths to help fight sexual temptation <p> While all believers in Christ have been declared righteous in Jesus and are no longer under Gods just condemnation ( Rom. 8:1-2 ) , the power and influence of all sinful desires are not always removed at the moment of conversion . Christians will be tempted throughout the course of their life ( Matt. 6:13 ) . Such temptations will include the inclination to abandon and exchange Gods good design for sex for the sexual brokenness offered by the world . Yet , Gods Word promises a means of escaping and resisting temptation , even temptations related to homosexuality . <p> The following truths represent a survey of biblical steps to help those who struggle with temptations to sexual sins : <p> 1 . Contemplate Gods good design for sex <p> Genesis 2:15-25 and 3:1-11 reveal Gods design for marriage from the beginning . The marriage relationship of a husband and a wife is fundamentally a covenantal relationship . Two become one , both physiologically and emotionally . Sex originates in this covenantal context , consummating the verbal commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As designed by God , sex is intended to be enjoyed in shameless , heterosexual marital monogamy . Yet , as sin entered the world , Gods good designed was broken and distorted . As we fight the broken temptations that this world offers us , we must think deeply about Gods intention for sex . <p> 2 . Consider Gods call to sexual purity <p> The fear of falling into temptation can be paralyzing to a believer and lead to a refusal to fight the good fight . <p> In 1 Thessalonians 4:1-8 , Paul points the people to holiness in sexual morality . The first point that he makes is that the believers in Thessalonica ought to " abstain from sexual immorality , " which essentially consist of any sexual thought or action outside of the context of a heterosexual , monogamous marriage . Whether it is pornography , premarital sex , extramarital sex or any other host of sexual perversion outside of Gods plan in marriage , the Christian is to abstain , to flee from sexual immorality . Gods call to sexual purity is not intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , to preserve the goodness of sex in light of its divine intention . When God calls us away from sexual immorality , he is calling us to something better ! As followers of Christ , we must fight to trust in the goodness of Gods call over against the siren calls of sexual immorality . <p> 3 . Count on Gods provision in temptation <p> First Corinthians 10:12-13 makes it clear that Christians are not exempt from serious temptations . Paul is well aware of such temptations in his churches , especially sexual temptations . Paul , however , is confident that God is more than able to aid those who are fighting temptation . The fear of falling into temptation can be paralyzing to a believer and lead to a refusal to fight the good fight . Yet , Gods Word promises that he is faithful to aid us , even when we are tempted . Christians , thus , must count on Gods provision , believing that he who is in them is greater than he who is in the world . <p> 4 . Celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ specializes in taking the sexually immoral , the idolater , the homosexual , the thief , the greedy person , the drunk , the reviler and the swindler and making them into citizens of the Kingdom of God who have been washed , who have been sanctified , who have been justified " in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God " ( 1 Cor. 6:9-11 ) . While it is true that temptation is a common experience for all people , there is real hope in Jesus Christ . Though you fall , by the grace of God , the blood of Jesus , and the power of the Holy Spirit , you may stand up again . Do not believe the lie that God loves you less when you have fallen into temptation . For while our sin does grieve our gracious God , he is faithful and just to forgive all who confess and repent of their sin and trust Jesus for salvation . <p> In sum , temptation is common to all people .

This is true for those who struggle with heterosexual sins and homosexual sins . Christ came to die for all sinners , not simply a particular class or type of sin .

Yet only after that measure fail to many pro-lifers ( like me ) read the fine print : the AHCA would have only defunded Planned Parenthood for one year . <p> Why is it so difficult to keep taxpayer money from flowing to one of Americas most evil corporations ? The answer is the Senate and the courts . <p> The primary reason that denying taxpayer funds to an organization that performs abortions is politically untenable is because one of the two major political parties in America fully supports taxpayer funding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any abortion in all nine months of pregnancy for any woman who wants one is literally a plank in the Democratic Party platform : <p> The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman 's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy , including a safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay . We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right . Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman , her family , her doctor , and her clergy ; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way . <p> Notice the claim to " oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right " includes the " right " to taxpayer-funded abortions . When an entire political party clarifies that they will oppose any efforts to reduce taxpayer funding that goes to pay for abortions , we should n't be surprised when members of that political party oppose an effort to eliminate taxpayer funding of the group that performs the most abortions in America . <p> This has certainly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Congress in August 2015 the vote was 241-187 to defund Planned Parenthood . Only three Republicans voted against the measure and only two Democrats voted for it . The Senate defeated the same measure 46 to 53 . It needed 60 votes to pass . Only two Democrats in the SenateSens . Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) and Joe Donnelly ( D-Ind. ) voted to cut off the funding and one RepublicanMark Kirk ( R-Il. ) voted to keep funding . ( Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) voted no , but only because that allows him to bring the bill back for a vote at a later time . ) <p> Even though the House has enough votes to pass defunding and President Trump would sign it into law , a full-scale defunding bill currently cant get through the Senate because of the ability of Democrats in to filibuster any legislation that cant reach a veto-proof 60 votes . <p> That is why House Speaker Paul Ryan is proposing once again to defund through the budget reconciliation process , which would require only 51 votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool , because that gets it in law . Reconciliation is the way to go , " said Speaker Ryan in recent press conference . While this would be a positive step forward , it would only defund the abortion provider for one year . <p> Unfortunately , the problem is not limited to the federal level . Even efforts to defund Planned Parenthood at the state level have been rebuffed because of the courts . <p> In 2011 , Gov . Mitch Daniels ( R-In. ) signed a law to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid funding from the state of Indiana . Soon after , lawmakers in Arizona , North Carolina , Kansas , Tennessee , and Texas also attempted to exclude funding of the abortion provider from their states pools of public insurance providers . <p> In response , the federal courts have blocked all of those efforts , ruling that states can not deny women access to providers who meet the federal requirements to qualify for Medicaid . Planned Parenthood is classified as a " qualified medical provider " and is thus eligible for Medicaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a workaround : refuse to accept federal funding for the states womens health programs . By choosing to fully fund the program at the state level , Texas is technically allowed to exclude Planned Parenthood . But Planned Parenthood sued the state to prevent defunding and won an injunction . A U.S. District recently extended the injunction blocking Texas from removing Planned Parenthood from Medicaid contracts until the conclusion of the full trial of the abortion companys lawsuit . <p> Last month , the Republican-controlled Iowa Senate voted on a similar measure . If the bill passes the state House and is signed into law it will likely be subject to a similar lawsuit as the one in Texas . <p> In the fact of our impending failure , pro-lifers should n't grow discouraged . But we should be realistic . Currently , there is n't much we can do to stop the flow of federal money to abortion providers .

But as knowledgeable as my professors in seminary were , they could not prepare me for this moment . How could I , a Christian minister , fight human trafficking ? For that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Global Slavery Index , there are as many as 45.8 million people around the world held in what amounts to modern day slavery. 1 Cases have been reported in every country , as well as every state in the U.S. Whether the victimized are trafficked into the commercial sex industry , the agricultural sector or the hospitality and service industries , each person has one thing in common : they are vulnerable . Human trafficking can be defined as the exploitation of vulnerability for commercial gain . For this reason , human trafficking can happen anywhere because there are vulnerable people everywhere . <p> The God of the vulnerable <p> Vulnerability should not be a new idea for the Christian community . As a matter of fact , it is a key theme throughout both the Old and New Testament Scriptures . A cursory reading will reveal that God identifies not with the earthly elite , but with those who lack power , protection and social status . <p> God , by virtue of his character , desires to bring " justice " to those who are in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " justice " is found over 200 times in the Bible . Its Hebrew form , mishpat , can mean " to treat people equitably , " or " to give them what they are due . In the Old Testament , God is so clearly known by this love for justice that he is identified as the " God of Justice " ( Isa. 30:18 ; 61:6 ; Mal. 2:17 ) . One particular Hebrew writer goes as far as describing him as the " Father of the fatherless and protector of widows " ( Psa . 68:5 ; Exod. 22:21-24 ; Lev . 23:22 ; Deut. 24:19 , 26:12 ) . <p> In the New Testament , the reader discovers that the ministry of both Jesus and the early church is marked by this distinct attribute . In his inaugural address , Jesus quotes Isaiah 61 explaining that he is the messiah that has come to " proclaim good news to the poor . " This " good news " was that Christ was bringing a new kingdom to bear ; a kingdom where justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . With this in mind , James , the brother of Jesus , wrote to the early Christian church , explaining that the " religion that is oneself unstained from the world " ( James 1:27 ) . In other words , not only does God identify with marginalized people , but he challenges his followers to join him by living justly . <p> How to join God in the work of justice <p> In his seminal work , Experiencing God , author Henry Blackaby explains that for the Christian the key to discovering the will of God for ones life is to " find where God is at work and to join him there .

With that said , how can the local church join God in the work of justice ? <p> We can join God in his work by recognizing and responding to the vulnerabilities in our communities . <p> First , we must recognize our own vulnerability . For many of us , we would rather run from our weaknesses than acknowledge them ; however , it is our vulnerability that actually gives us the platform to serve other broken people . The recognition of our own frailty , though sobering , levels the " playing field , " so-to-speak . Whether we are standing in line at a soup kitchen on Saturday night or sitting in a pew on Sunday morning , we are all people in need of a Savior . For this reason , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , identified with each of us by being born into abject poverty to a subjugated people over 2,000 years ago . Christ willingly chose to save the vulnerable from death by becoming vulnerable to death . As we reflect on the dire nature of our situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rise in our place , we are compelled to serve others . In other words , as we become acquainted with our own vulnerability , we are better prepared to notice those in need around us . <p> With that in mind , we can join God in his work by recognizing and responding to the vulnerabilities in our communities . It is said that someone once asked Mother Teresa how she dealt with global poverty . Her answer seemed remarkably simplistic : " You do the thing that 's in front of you . " 2 The best way to discover who is most vulnerable in your community is to ask your community . Start by setting up appointments with local law enforcement , social service providers , NGOs , and even the vulnerable themselves . Ask each of them to share what they think are the greatest needs facing your community . The added benefit of this approach is that as you listen , you will also discover people and organizations with whom your church can collaborate to better serve your community . <p> Too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficking , we are left feeling helpless and overwhelmed .

Anything less than the full truth prevents the possibility of real pluralism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " identity " more than " statements of faith " is simply wrong because it approaches religion from the wrong vantage point . Religion is about much more than identity , but never less . But taking this logic further , we must see that it is religious devotion itself that builds ones identity ; not the other way around . I am a Christian , but I am not a Christian on secularized grounds that countenances progressive faith claims first . I make no apologies in confessing that Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved ( Acts 4:12 ; 1 Tim . 2:5 ) . That truth is about much more than my identity ; that truth is about how the universe is ultimately accountable to divine judgment ( Acts 17:30-31 ) . <p> But above all , and central to the argument I 'm making in this article , in making this claim , Aslan is actually undermining the positive aspects and prospects of what pluralism means , strives after and entails . <p> Real pluralism strives for social tranquility by agreeing to to live peaceably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who God is , how he calls us to live and how we attain a relationship with him . <p> We do no service to our neighbors in weakening the claims of our religion in order to serve a greater social good . The social good is better served when honest brokers approach one another within a society that pledges to foster religious liberty by giving each equal space in the public squarenot in spite of deep difference , but because of it . <p> This means true pluralism entails religious liberty . Only an environment committed to treating religions with respect and equal freedom can hope to attain a social environment where disagreement is resolved without recourse to violence and social unrest . <p> Reza Aslan means well , and I hope the show is better than what is advertised , but let 's live in a society honest about our religious differences and which refuses to drain religion of its doctrinal center in the name of feel-good liberalism. 43169 @qwx903169 <p> This will be a year of incredible new books .

@@100509163 @4709163/ <h> How your church can minister to refugees <p> It all began with a call from a local mechanic to my friend , Lucy . A Muslim woman from Tanzania was returning from delivering donations to a refugee family . Her tire blew on her way home . Once her mechanic arrived to repair the tire , they began talking about the African refugee family she had been serving . The mechanic later called his friend Lucy for help . He knew she was fluent in the familys language and had experience in bringing people together for fellowship . <p> The two of them visited the family and learned there were other refugee families in need . That 's when Lucy reached out to her church to see what could be done . One thing led to another , and many of the people at my church , including myself , began caring for , loving and befriending the refugee families from Africa . We now have a ministry team and dozens of people from our church and surrounding community that are involved in the lives of our refugee friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although , not everyone is able to meet refugees as naturally as this , you are probably aware of refugees in your town . So how can everyday Christians like you and me start ministering to these neighbors ? Forming relationships with refugees might be challenging at first . If you 're uncertain where to start , you can use the Refugee Processing Centers Affiliate Directory to find out about agencies in your city . It may take some time , but with perseverance , you 'll likely find these agencies helpful . <p> Once you begin to build relationships with refugees and have made your intentions known to the agency supporting them , I encourage you to share your desire with your pastor . Having the blessing of the leadership of your church will prove to be invaluable to your ministryit becomes everyones ministry . In addition , there are a few things you can do to enhance this kind of ministry in your church : <p> 1 . Seek to know the person : At my church , we refer to " our friends who came as refugees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than refugees . They are people with hopes and dreams just like you and me . They have feelings , experience victories and make mistakes . Since many of us are fixers and doers , we can sometimes turn people into projects . My best friend , after traveling to Berlin to work with a refugee ministry , wisely said , " Remember the person , not the problem . Remember the name , not the need . " Of course , she did n't  mean to shove their problems aside or ignore the needs , but before all of that , its important to remember refugees are fellow image bearers whom we are called to love , help and befriend . <p> 2 . Recruit a team : When I first met our friends from Africa , it was through a small group of people from my church that had been ministering to them . When I joined the team , it was made up of three Americans and two others representing different countries . I cant imagine doing any of this without them . Recruiting a team is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spurring one another on in love and good deeds as the Word says . Having a team will better enable you to love and empower the people you 're befriending . <p> 3 . Build a " house " : Once you have a few people who desire to minister to and befriend refugees , the team can start to bring structure to their efforts . I would recommend building a figurative house together . Here are the essential parts : <p> A foundation grounded in Christ : The team should first develop the mission and goals of the group . Crafting a mission statement will serve as a filter to determine which ideas should be pursued . Coupled with prayer , this should help remind everyone to stay focused on Christ and remain united . Our teams mission statement has proven to be a much needed reminder for us : " Our core mission to our friends who came as refugees is to love and empower them , thereby drawing them closer to our Lord Jesus Christ and bringing glory to Him . " <p> A framework of team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role that supports the ministry and overall mission . Dreaming together and drafting a list of goals will also enable the team to prioritize needs and better determine how they will be met . Putting an organized approach behind the team will allow everyone to be more effective in the long run . When dreaming of ways to help your friends , I recommend bringing them into the conversation . You may find what you think is helpful differs from what your friends actually desire . <p> Doors to let people in : Helping refugees transition is no small task . It should be recognized as a long-term commitment . Opening the doors to involve others who are interested has helped us do far more than we could do on our own . Raising awareness and spreading the word is an effective tool in getting people involved in the ministry , but its important to be given the approval and blessing of your refugee friends before doing so . In addition , the approach should be one that honors and preserves the dignity of those you 're serving . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know their limitations . This kind of thinking has allowed us to put reasonable boundaries in place and pace ourselves as we walk alongside our friends . The first boundary the team must set is one where everyone recognizes who God is and who they are . We must remember our place and his . When we are grounded in knowing that the Lord is the one in control , were better able to recognize our own limitations , establish healthy boundaries and persevere in our mission . <p> The church has a unique opportunity to love boldly and serve the sojourners that have come to America . At my church , our mission is to be " For the Gospel and For the City , " which means we are committed to reaching every person in our city with the good news of Jesus . Lucy was living out this mission when she decided to serve the refugee family . Lucy never dreamt that her actions would lead to an official church ministry .

You are likable , fun , considerate , helpful , and all-around good human beings . You are awesome . I flock to you . <p> These friends of mine , upon hearing that I was writing a book on friendship , asked me to tackle these questions : How does one foster intimate , true friendships and remain hospitable without becoming cliquish ? Is it even healthy to cut off the number of friendships you have ? <p> The friends that I mention are women using their influence to serve others , honor others , seek out the best interest of others , and love others in a way that brings glory to the Lord . For those who are jealous of the friend-magnets in your midst , to be fair , I do n't  think its as cut and dried as it seems . I believe these women are a real-life chicken/egg scenario : do people come toward friend-magnets simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go toward others ready to bless and honor ? I see my friend-magnet friends working hard at friendship and being extremely others-centered . They are genuinely interested in others , honor others , and listen to others . My friend-magnet friends all have wildly different personalities , so its not that they have a charisma necessarily , although I think they are delightful people . They are simply people who consistently go toward others , no matter who they are , and seek to make other women feel comfortable . <p> If you are a person who attracts friends easily , please know that you 've been given a gift from the Lord . Youve been granted a magnetism and a way of making people feel loved . Thank Him for this gift , but please also recognize that this gift is not about you . The gift you 've been given is the gift of influence , and its important to consider how you will use it . <p> If you are a woman who attracts friends easily , my encouragement to you is to use your influence to serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends easily , my encouragement to you is to use your influence to serve the outsiders . Keep an eye out for the marginalized , the fringe , the new , the lonely , the quiet and unsure ones . Your influence pointed in the direction of an outsider can have great impact . It does n't  take mucha word of welcome , an invitation to a playdate , a thoughtful encouragement about a job well-done , or remembering her nameand a whole new world opens up for the one who needs a world , any world , to open up . <p> The truth of the matter is that we all have the ability to be friend-magnets when we enter a room with the words , intentions , and body language of seeing others--There you are ! --rather than saying Here I am ! Everyone look at me ! Everyone listen to me ! or the opposite , false humility response , I hope no one notices me . I will feel too self-conscious . We esteem others as more important than ourselves . We keep an eye out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We move toward the outside and pull those we find there into the mix . And let 's face it : Do n't  we all feel like we live on the fringes in some capacity ? Havent we all felt like an outsider at some point ? We all know the relief of someone pulling us from the outside to the inside . Well be their friends for life . <p> An honoring person who looks for the outsider soon becomes a safe person for many , many women . In other words , her opportunities for friendship are abundant and overflowing . This is why my people-magnet friends are asking , " How does one foster intimate , true friendships and remain hospitable without becoming cliquish ? " and " Is it even healthy to cut off the number of friendships you have ? " Because a person who honors others will eventually have to navigate these things . <p> And I say , in response , that part of honoring others is connecting others . There is a special kind of joy in connecting two women we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or life circumstance in common . We do n't  have to be everyones bestie , and just because we 've included someone does n't  mean we have to become their intimate friend . We can help foster community among women by being a bridge between them . <p> So , for my darling friends who are worried about having too many BFFs to handle , this is what I would say : honor all and be deep friends with some . Be friendly and hospitable to all and give intimate attention to a few . Welcome all . Keep an eye out for all . Love all . You do n't  have to be close friends with everyone , but you can certainly use your God-given influence to bless others and connect women with one another .

@@100509166 @4709166/ <h> I 'm not called to adopt . Now what ? <p> There are multiple ways for the church to get involved in proclaiming the gospel . Adoption is a clear way to display the gospel , but its not the only way . In my last article , Orphans , adoption and the heart of the gospel , I discussed the idea that adoption should be viewed like The Great Commissionwhile not everyone is called to adopt , everyone is called to care for the welfare of orphans and vulnerable children . <p> When the church is on the frontlines of caring for the most vulnerable in society , we display the heart of God to a watching world . So , I have four suggestions for those who are n't  called to adopt but want to be involved in caring for orphans and vulnerable children : <p> 1 . Pray for orphans and vulnerable children . Never underestimate the power of prayer !

Petition the heart of our Father on behalf of children . Ask the Lord to provide safe , permanent and loving homes and families . Pray for the families that adopt children . Ultimately , pray that the souls of the orphan and vulnerable would be saved into an eternal adoption . <p> 2 . Financially help those who are called to adopt . One of the biggest objections people give to adoption is the lack of financial resources . Adoption can be extremely expensive . Depending on where you choose to adopt from , the costs can be as high as $40,000 . Consider financially contributing to those who desire to adopt . Many couples are more than willing to open their hearts and homes but do n't  have sufficient means in their pocketbooks to cover the expensive adoption process .

" <p> 3 . Advocate for children . Each of us can use our voice to advocate on behalf of the fatherless , vulnerable , abused and marginalized children . One of the biggest ways to advocate for children is to incorporate Gods care for the vulnerable into regular preaching from the pulpit . Pastors and church leaders have a responsibility to accurately portray the heart of God from the pulpit . The Lord has entrusted each one of us with different gifts , bank accounts , schedules , etc . Examine your resources , and consider the ways you can advocate for children . You can also learn how to be a better advocate for children at conference like Evangelicals for Life . <p> 4 . Serve those who are directly involved in child welfare .

Like the Blues and Rock , Jazz would cross the boundaries of race and classthere would be the Chet Bakers and the Dave Brubecks of the worldbut at its core , it ca n't be severed from its roots as the sounds of a people who inherited a legacy of injustice . It is not the music of a cozy brunch on a Saturday morning . Its the sound of profound mourning and profound hope , protest and praise , love and death . <p> As I fell down the rabbit hole of Blue Note Records , Verve , ECM and other jazz labels , I also found myself searching for a view into the culture that gave birth to it . At some point , I stumbled upon Langston Hughes . <p> Hughes was a poet during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920sa time when jazz was finding its feet and African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His poems capture the tempo and rhythms of the music that was filling Harlem at the time , and they made explicit the sentiments behind them . Slavery and the civil war were not-too-distant memories during the Harlem Renaissance . It was a haven of hopeful creativity and flourishing , even while Jim Crow and segregation still held their stranglehold in the American south . The art of the Harlem Renaissance lived in that tensionthe promise of freedom , the burden of racism , the burden of history . Hughes wrote often about that tension , referring to the hopes of equality and dignity as a " dream deferred . " <p> What happens to a dream deferred ? <p> Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ? <p> Or fester like a sore <p> And then run ? <p> Does it stink like rotten meat ? <p> Or crust and sugar over <p> Like a syrupy sweet ? <p> Maybe it just sags <p> like a heavy load . <p> Or does it explode ? <p> Where Charlie Parker ( and later , Monk , Miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hughes ( and Zora Neale Hurston , and later , James Baldwin and Toni Morrison ) gave it words . And Hughes poetry managed to express it in rhythms and language that are shaped by the same cultural forces as jazz . You can hear it , both in the rhythms and in the sentiment . <p> In " Still Here , " he writes : <p> Ive been scarred and battered . <p> My hopes the wind done scattered . <p> Snow has friz me , sun has baked me . <p> Looks like between em <p> They done tried to make me <p> Stop laughin , stop lovin , stop livin <p> But I do n't  care ! <p> I 'm still here ! <p> Hughes understood the way that music served as both witness and catharsis . In his poem , " The Weary Blues , " he wrote : <p> Droning a drowsy syncopated tune , <p> Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon , <p> I heard a Negro play . <p> Down on Lenox Avenue the other night <p> By the pale dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy sway . . . <p> He did a lazy sway . . . <p> To the tune o those Weary Blues . <p> With his ebony hands on each ivory key <p> He made that poor piano moan with melody . <p> O Blues ! <p> Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool <p> He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool . <p> Sweet Blues ! <p> Coming from a black mans soul . <p> O Blues ! <p> In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone <p> I heard that Negro sing , that old piano moan <p> " Ai n't  got nobody in all this world , <p> Ai n't  got nobody but ma self . <p> Is gwine to quit ma frownin <p> And put ma troubles on the shelf . " <p> Thump , thump , thump , went his foot on the floor . <p> He played a few chords then he sang some more <p> " I got the Weary Blues <p> And I ca n't be satisfied . <p> Got the Weary Blues <p> And ca n't be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that I had died . " <p> And far into the night he crooned that tune . <p> The stars went out and so did the moon . <p> The singer stopped playing and went to bed <p> While the Weary Blues echoed through his head . <p> He slept like a rock or a man that 's dead . <p> The old bluesman sings , " Ai n't  got nobody in the world . . . " and " I ca n't be satisfied . " But then he goes home and sleeps like a rock . The song itself satisfiesor at least satisfies enough to keep the old man going . <p> Its tempting to separate art from the world that gave birth to it , to let jazz and blues be nostalgic " Americana " and to ignore its power as prophet and protest . Its tempting to sanitize our musical history and ignore the way many great musicians were discriminated against , or to ignore the deep bitterness that formed as a result . B.B. King supposedly carried a pistol to every show he played after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with JET magazine , Miles Daviswho had as successful a career in music as any jazz musician could hope forsaid , " If somebody told me I only had an hour to live , I 'd spend it choking a white man . I 'd do it nice and slow . " Please , let 's never pretend that this music is light listening ever again . <p> An invitation to listen <p> What it is , however , is an invitation ; a chance to listen to the sorrows and hopes of our African American brothers and sisters . Their joy and their righteous pride , their pain and anger , their pleading for justice and equality , their declarations of beauty and dignity . Where political dialogue grows stale and ideological , the arts can cut through , whether its painting or music or literature , bypassing our rational defenses and letting us see andmore importantlyfeel the experiences of someone else . The stunning and beautiful legacy of African American music , literature and art stands as an invitation to people like mea white , middle-class , Southern Baptistto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk away a little more understanding and empathetic . <p> It is , of course , true that what we can learn through the arts is not the sum and total of anothers experience . It is also true that you can experience the arts and not learn a thing . That happens when we engage without curiosity , without expecting that we have something to learn . But patience , humility and curiosity will be rewarded . The world will reveal itself to be larger than you thought , more perplexing , more sad and more beautiful . <p> So turn on Coltranes " A Love Supreme " and hear his soaring longing for God , his deep sense of the brokenness of the world and the brokenness of his own cancer-addled body . Listen to Lee Morgans " Search for the New Land " and hear both the sense of sorrow and possibility that Morgan felt in the midst of a growing civil rights movement and a growing African consciousness . Read The Bluest Eye and feel the discomfort of a child who learns to dislike her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of Harlem and feel the pressures of stereotypes that accompany being young , black and male . Or listen to Henry Louis Gates . Or Maya Angelou . <p> The point is to listen . To open your heart . To tap into your empathy andjust as importantyour curiosity about the world and about the way our African American brothers and sisters experience it . Ask where their stories , jokes and strokes of genius come from . Remember that they are image bearers like you , whose feel for the world is very different because their place in it is very different . Curiosity will bring understanding , understanding will bring empathy and empathy , love .

Illinois House Bill 40 , currently awaiting a vote by the states House of Representatives , would strike from state law a provision that says Illinois medical assistance program can not pay for abortions . The bill also would allow state workers health insurance plans to include coverage for abortions . <p> Illinois Right to Life is one of the pro-life organizations that opposes HB 40 . Its director , Emily Troscinski , said the measure is " the most extreme abortion-expanding bill " shes seen in her tenure at the organization . <p> " What it does is it provides free abortions for those on Medicaid for any reason through all nine months of pregnancy , " Troscinski said .

Currently , Medicaid covers 108 abortions a year , Troscinski said . <p> The bill was first proposed in March 2015 but failed to pass in the General Assembly . It was reintroduced in 2016 following Donald Trumps election as U.S. President , with a new provision that would allow Illinois to continue to perform abortions should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v.

Sheri Jesiel ( R-Winthrop Harbor ) , who told Springfields State Journal-Register newspaper , " I take great exception to the section that removes the personhood of a baby .

Is Jesus calling Christians a preservative here ? Is our witness the thing that keeps the culture from decaying ? Our witness to the truth does have a preservative effect , but the Bible promises that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) . The cultural tide will never truly turn before Jesus returns . <p> The Bible also describes salt as medicine ( Ez.16:4 ) . Are we supposed to act like medicine , then ? In some ways . We are called to give comfort to the afflicted ( 2 Cor. 1:6 ) , but God is the Great Physician . Healing is ultimately his job . <p> Salt has a third use that Jesus listeners on the mountain would have known well . It purifies . We see this in 2 Kings 2:18-22 when Elishas first task after taking over for Elijah was to clear a stream filled with toxins . The purifying agent he used was salt . Our influence works the same way . As Christ followers , we can purify our homes , neighborhoods and churches by continuously pointing to the gospel with our words and actions . <p> When Jesus spoke about salt losing its taste , he was n't referencing losing our salvation ( we can know that from the rest of scripture ) , but rather , losing our influence . Contaminated salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this metaphor . The throwing out and trampling Jesus mentioned might well have been literal . Impure salt does have a function . While not much good for purifying or healing , it does kill plants . Fruit crops are especially sensitive to it . Impure salt eliminates fruitfulness . Two thousand years after this sermon , that will preach ! <p> Being salty does n't  mean being spicy or gritty . It should not be our primary goal to act as a cultural irritant . Our influence should have a purifying effect on those around us . Instead , when our methods or motivations are off , we may very well kill kingdom growth . <p> That sobering image is backed up by another one of Jesus gardening metaphors : " Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree bad and its fruit bad , for the tree is known by its fruit " ( Matt. 12:33 ) . What fruit will we be known by ? <p> " I tell you , on the day of judgment people will give account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned " ( Matt. 12:36-37 ) . Jesus words here bring us to a fork in the road . How does Gods inspired Word apply to how we talk in a virtual word ? Surely , if every word matters , so does every like , share , comment and post . Its not just noise , or venting , or over sharing . Its choking out the fruit . <p> Knowing which hills to die on <p> So , what makes a mountain and what makes a molehill ? When should we be silent , and when should we shout it from the rooftops ? Here are four pivot points to help us think it through . <p> 1 . The gospel is primary <p> Jesus final words to @ of the age " ( Matt. 28:19-20 ) . <p> Share the gospel . Teach the Word . Make disciples . If we stuck to these three big ideas , how would it change the rhetoric ? It would be so convenient if Jesus took a stand on all of the issues of our times . It would be great to be able to quote chapter and verse for my position on every hot topic . But Jesus was not a political candidate running for office interested in building a platform by checking red or blue boxes . If we really read his words without an agenda , we see that he was obsessed with the kingdom , salvation and sin . He talked about little else . Perhaps its time to stop war dancing around the issues and start talking about what Jesus talked about . Yes , some of these issues will involve clear lines of sin and need to be talked about , but we have to be ever-so-careful to watch our tone and the content of our conversation . <p> 2 . No one belongs under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew it ? Or the one who just released a book that 's causing a stir ? Does the Bible writes us a permission slip to grace to those who hear " ( Eph. 4:29 ) . Its counter to our current sub-culture for sure , but what might happen if we defended the truth with grace and saw encouraging the body as our job instead of policing the blogosphere ? <p> 3 . Be winsome <p> Winsome is a word I 'd like to give vocab quizzes on in every Christian home in America . Officially , winsome means " attractive or appealing in appearance or character . " Unofficially , it means to be nice . Its a word that peaked in the 1900s , but winsome needs to be brought back . <p> While there is room for humor and wit among the people of God , there is not room for snark , insults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling the kettle black on this one , but I want to raise the bar in my own conversations . Join me ? <p> 4 . Its okay to stop clicking <p> Proverbs 17:28 offers this nugget of truth : " Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise ; when he closes his lips , he is deemed intelligent . " I like the Mark Twain paraphrase , " It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt . " <p> Tony Reinke reminds us that Jesus called us to be salt and light , not salt and like . We do n't  have to confront everyone we disagree with . We do n't  have to give an opinion on everything we read . It may not be good for your metrics , but it will be good for your influence to pray more than you Tweet , ponder more than you post and wait before hitting " send .

@@100509172 @4709172/ <h> Puberty suppression and the transgender movement : Why Christians ought to have concern <p> An important paper has been released that challenges the practice of puberty suppression in gender dysphoric children . <p> Christians need to pay attention to this report , because it captures many of the underlying problems bubbling underneath the surface of the transgender revolution that are at root incompatible with Christian teaching . <p> Titled " Growing Pains : Problems with Puberty Suppression in Treating Gender Dysphoria " and published this week at The New Atlantis , the authors Paul W. Hruz , Lawrence S. Meyer , and Paul R. McHugh challenge medical consensus on the practice of delaying puberty in gender dysphoric children by suggesting that arguments in favor of the practice are based on " subjective judgments and speculation " rather than " rigorous empirical evidence . " After a thorough review of existing medical literature , the authors conclude " there remains little evidence that puberty suppression is reversible , safe , or effective for treating gender dysphoria . " This report comes months after Meyer and McHughs initial report challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To those new to the topic , guidelines for treating young children who suffer from gender dysphoria suggest implementing hormonal treatment in order to delay the onset of secondary sex characteristics such as breast development in women or broadened shoulders in men . To this pattern of thinking , delaying puberty gives children uncertain of their gender identity time to determine their gender identity without the " consequences " of growing into their adult body . And , should the children persist in their dysphoria into adolescence and choose to live as a member of the opposite sex , suppressing the development of secondary sex characteristics makes " transitioning " by way of surgical intervention less invasive . <p> The report offers many to challenges to the medical communitys handling of puberty suppression in children . <p> Among them , the authors believe that puberty suppression encourages children who experience gender dysphoria to continue persisting in a cross-sex identity , despite the statistical reality that feelings of gender dysphoria reduce with age . Upwards of 80 percent of children grow comfortable in their bodies and no longer experience dysphoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have , as they grow older , found their gender to be aligned with their sex . Gender identity for children is elastic ( that is , it can change over time ) and plastic ( that is , it can be shaped by forces like parental approval and social conditions ) . If the increasing use of gender-affirming care does cause children to persist with their identification as the opposite sex , then many children who would otherwise not need ongoing medical treatment would be exposed to hormonal and surgical interventions . " According to the authors , puberty suppression makes it more likely that children whose gender dysphoria may subside might continue to identify as a member of the opposite sex . In short , puberty suppression discourages its users from obtaining a healthy and normative gender identity . <p> The authors also find that puberty suppression does not resolve or address the causes of the underlying gender dysphoria . They write , " We simply do not know what causes a child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like puberty suppression , can not directly address it . " At best , puberty suppression is a response to deeper ailments whose origin and cure are not yet known . <p> There is also concern about how normal patterns of puberty are resumed for those who stop using suppressants . Why ? Because the research is " very weak " in such instances : " This is because there are virtually no published reports , even case studies , of adolescents withdrawing from puberty-suppressing drugs and then resuming the normal pubertal development typical for their sex . Rather than resuming biologically normal puberty , these adolescents generally go from suppressed puberty to medically conditioned cross-sex puberty , when they are administered cross-sex hormones at approximately age 16 . " The authors are concerned that the lack of research on the effects of puberty suppression on those who stop taking suppressants is not robust , which could pose damaging consequences later on in their development . <p> There are also other harmful consequences of puberty suppression : stunting height development , reduced bone density , and infertility by harming gonadal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observing , " It remains unknown whether or not ordinary sex-typical puberty will resume following the suppression of puberty in patients with gender dysphoria . " That last sentence needs emphasized because its importance can not be understated . In the eyes of the reports authors , a medical revolution is happening without solid evidence on the long-term effects . The authors summarize their conclusion by stating that an immense medical revolution is happening under the guise of " consensus " where no such consensus exists . <p> Whatever the research findings , Christians should be sensitive to the needs and realities of those who are afflicted with gender dysphoria and have nothing less than compassion for those who experience emotional distress . Such individuals experience disproportionate levels of anxiety , depression , thoughts of suicide , and suicide . <p> At the same time , Christians must be sober-minded about the type of medical revolution occurring under the guise of transgenderism . Furthermore , Christians should not encourage the use of puberty suppression in young children nor the use of hormonal therapies to nullify ones biological sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ones embodiment as a creature made in Gods image . <p> We are living at a time where what it means to be made male or female is hotly contested . Are humans divine image bearers , designed by God with an objective human nature ? Or are men and women simply constructs made up by society that can be toyed with and manipulated at will ? <p> This is indeed one of the most startling repercussions that follow from actions like puberty suppression : The transgender movement relies upon an unbiblical anthropology that sees natural bodily development as subservient to , and conquerable by , the sheer act of human will . <p> The authors criticize a 2016 report issued by the Human Rights Campaign demonstrating how the transgender movement treats healthy body development as a potentially " irreversible " obstacle to human fulfillment .

The act of puberty suppression signals that the bodys design bears no intrinsic , physical goal . By acting to disrupt the bodys natural design , the transgender movement signals that the goodness of Gods creation is something subjectable to mans control . Actions , philosophies , and movements that subvert human nature will end up subverting human flourishing as well . <p> As I write about in my forthcoming book , God and the Transgender Debate , effort or action taken to suppress the truth of our natural biology , or to reverse our natural biology , runs contrary to Gods Word , since it makes man the Creator , rather than God . <p> The intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such therapy is aimed at contradicting otherwise healthy bodily development based on the view of someones mind or feelings .

@@100509175 @4709175/ <h> 3 things to know about pregnancy resources centers <p> An unfortunate reality of the modern perception of Christians is that we are often identified with what we oppose rather than what we support . This view exists on the individual and societal levels , permeating both our interpersonal and organizational communication . One organization that has been poorly stereotyped by this negativity is the pregnancy resource center . <p> With Sanctity of Life Sunday having just occurred in January , the value of human life ought to be all the more prevalent in our minds . It is a recurring theme in our theology , yet it can at times feel a bit abstract . It is difficult to put a finger on what action steps should be taken in light of such a doctrine . <p> Because of this , I submit a suggestion that may or may not be new to you : Support your local pregnancy resource center . If you have heard this before , you likely have , at best , only a fuzzy understanding of what these organizations actually do . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As someone who has volunteered at centers like these for the past three years , here are some things I wish I knew before going in : <p> 1 . Pregnancy resource centers are pro-woman . <p> A common misconception about these organizations is that their sole concern is with unborn children , and that little-to no positive attention is given to mothers . Often accompanying this myth are horrifying rumors . Some have accused pregnancy resource centers of using deceptive and/or guilt-driven tactics in order to manipulate women into compliance with the ethics of the organization . I am proud to say that this is categorically false . <p> In reality , young adult females are the core clientele of these centers . From their first nervous phone calls to their final appointments , they are treated with the utmost respect , sensitivity and kindness . This remains the case regardless of their race , background or even what choice they make in their pregnancies . <p> A majority of the services provided at these facilities benefit women directly . They administer pregnancy tests , perform ultrasounds and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive personal mentoring throughout their pregnancies and for some time after . Counseling is even offered for women who are struggling emotionally post-abortion . Significantly , all of these services are free and confidential . <p> 2 . Pregnancy resource centers are pro-family . <p> In pursuit of the provision of holistic care , pregnancy resource centers are committed to meeting the needs of families . Resources such as baby clothes , diapers and wipes are provided for clients as they are needed . Male mentors are available to meet regularly with soon-to-be father figures . Some of the larger centers even offer a variety of classes for new parents on subjects including , but not limited to , labor , nutrition and finances . <p> In the unavoidable cases where the center is unable to meet particular needs of a client , pregnancy resource centers are active in giving community referrals . They serve to connect clients with local aid organizations like Salvation Army , domestic violence shelters and food pantries . For those families or young mothers who are seeking information on adoption , referrals can be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pro-life . <p> Being pro-life means so much more than being anti-abortion . This is well understood in pregnancy resource centers . They openly and honestly refuse to refer for or provide abortions , but they do not stop there . Women who have had abortions are cared for with the same compassion as those who choose life . <p> In addition to striving to meet the physical and emotional needs of clients , pregnancy resource centers seek to meet their spiritual needs . These centers are openly Christian , with staff and volunteers frequently sharing their faith through relationships with clients . These organizations are committed to the lives of all the men , women and children who come through their doors . <p> Thankfully , pregnancy resource centers are for the flourishing of life in many ways . Practicing a belief in the value of human dignity in our own lives ought to include supporting organizations like these . Volunteer . Pray . Donate . Advocate .

@@100509178 @4709178/ <h> Four ways to make each day count for eternity <p> Can one day really make that big of a difference ? The calendar turns 365 times every year , but there 's something special when the last day of the year gives way to January 1 . The New Year promises a fresh start . So we review , we dream , we plan , and finally , we resolve . <p> We do these things with the hope that the New Year will be better than the last one , but ultimately we do n't  live for just one better year . Our purpose in life is not limited by time . God created time and placed us inside of it for nowbut not forever . When time is no more , we will remain . So we live this moment , this day and this year with eternity in mind . <p> Annual goals are important , not because they are ultimate , but because they focus our lives on what is paramount . So with a timeless future in view , here are four suggestions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus a way of life . <p> When Jesus said , " Follow me , " he was n't asking his disciples for a one-time decision to put him on the top of their to-do list . Instead , he was inviting them to an ongoing relationship based on authenticity , intimacy and sacrifice . He was worth their lives , so he did n't  hesitate to ask for their full devotion . <p> For us , this devotion is expressed in a love relationship with Jesus where we communicate with him in daily Bible reading and prayer , where we respond to him through personal submission to his will , where we live in community with other believers and where we invite others to follow him through our witness and service . This relationship , however , does not come without a fight . <p> The world , the flesh and the devil war against us and attempt to siphon our affections away from God . The apostle Paul confessed this temptation in Romans 7 . Daily victory required a daily returning to Jesus to set his mind on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So practically , repentance is not just for the wayward prodigal living in gross rebellion ; its for the most devout followers of Jesus who battle with the prodigal still loitering inside of our hearts , tempting us to run away with him . <p> 2 . Make plans that build people . <p> When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem , he made a plan to rebuild the wall around the city , then he got to work . Just 52 days later , he finished the wall . It was a remarkable accomplishment . However , Nehemiahs ultimate goal was not to rebuild a wall , but to rebuild a people . With the wall complete and the city secure , the exiles could return . <p> Gods redeeming work is still to restore a people to himself for his glory . Any plans we make for any other reason become idols of our heart . Our health , relationships , finances , hobbies and our career are Gods provision for us to display the gospel as we invest in other people . God has not called us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die to ourselves and to live to make much of Jesus and the new life he gives to everyone who will trust in him . <p> 3 . Make room for unknown opportunities . <p> Its wise to set goals and make plans , but its wiser still to place every plan under the subjection of God . The Bible says , " A mans heart plans his way , but the Lord determines his steps " ( Prov. 16:9 ) . The unmet goals from last year may be the result of a slothful lack of discipline and focus , but some of our so-called failures may be the result of us listening to God and obeying him for something much better than our best made plans . <p> We pray and plan for the New Year , but we recognize that only God is sovereign . As we seek him first , we make ourselves available to him and adjust our lives along the way . This is n't a rationale for poor planning , undisciplined living or excuse making . Instead , its a humble awareness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God rather than toward him . <p> 4 . Make obedience an action . <p> Plans are for paper , but listening to and obeying God moves us to act . After the whiteboard dream sessions for New Year planning are over , January 1 asks this question , " Now what are you going to do ? " We soon discover that its easier to make plans than to act on them . The snooze button wins our attention or the Facebook status distracts us for just long enough to detour us from even the simplest of tasks . <p> Knowing Gods will , agreeing with Gods will and even celebrating Gods will are not the same things as doing Gods will . We must learn to think deeply on the things of God and to prayerfully seek Jesus first , but the Kingdom advances through those who take the time and make the effort to act . <p> " Whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord and not for men " ( Col. 3:23 ) . Whether the work is majestic or mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it with all of our heart . We manage our calendar , eliminate distractions , build relationships that encourage us to fulfill our calling , and then we keep our heart tender toward Jesus . Only he can produce lasting fruit through us . ( John 15:5 ) <p> Can one day on the calendar really make a difference ? When we join the Ancient of Days in his eternal work to redeem sinners and restore the world for the glory of God , every day makes a difference . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509179 @4709179/ <h> Cultivating a relevance that leads to diversity 43186 @qwx903186 <p> I once heard this phenomenon referred to as " the frog in a kettle . " This descriptive analogy is that when you place a live frog in a vat of warm water it will not jump out . The warm-blooded animal enjoys its surroundings and soaks in the soup . If the temperature is increased incrementally , the frog will not react , eventually being boiled alive by virtue of its failure to respond . In case study upon case study , churches in our locale failed to recognize the changing environment around them , ultimately leading to the demise of their congregations . <p> 3 steps to relevance <p> Become a student : The first step to becoming relevant is becoming a student of ones changing community . Our area is changing so rapidly that it is difficult to keep up with the data . When I first moved to Duluth , the fastest growing people group was Korean immigrants . I pass a dozen Korean congregations on the commute between my home and FBC Duluth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Asian people from India and Pakistan . A new Hindu temple has been constructed less than a mile from our church . There is also a rapidly growing African community . In 2015 , we had four families come to First Baptist Church Duluth from Nigeria . This week , as I write this chapter , we have added new families from Nigeria , Ivory Coast , and Uganda to our fellowship . Our changing community continues to be a radical case study . <p> Seek understanding : Once one comprehends the change taking place within a community , one must seek expertise in understanding new cultures that populate that area . International missionaries have referred to this process as locating the " person of peace " within the new culture , based on the words of Jesus in Luke 10:56 . This person may not yet be a Christian , but is nonetheless willing to share key cultural information that will aid in presenting the gospel . God has provided numerous persons of peace in my path to enhance my understanding of cross-cultural relationships . Often this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me someone of a particular people group who would be a champion in helping me reach their native people . These person-of-peace relationships may begin as a simple friendship and evolve into a full-blown ministry partnership . <p> Be an advocate : A third step in becoming relevant is being a visible advocate of community leaders . We found that the same issues facing our church were happening in every arena of community living . Therefore , we wanted to clearly communicate our support for our city government by being one of the sponsors of the mayors state of the city address . We desired to show support for our local school system by providing a teacher appreciation brunch on faculty work days and taking on volunteer roles in schools to relieve parents and allow them to enjoy their childs program or sports activity . <p> Churches are often seen more for what they are against than what they are for , but FBC Duluth has a desire to be for our city . In supporting community leaders and initiatives in Duluth , we can be seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in the prophet Jeremiahs words to Gods people about how to live as exiles in Babylon : <p> This is what the Lord of Hosts , the God of Israel , says to all the exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon : " Build houses and live in them . Plant gardens and eat their produce . Take wives and have sons and daughters . Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters . Multiply there ; do not decrease . Seek the welfare of the city I have deported you to . Pray to the Lord on its behalf , for when it has prosperity , you will prosper . " ( Jer. 29:7 ) <p> " If your church ceased to exist this week , other than your members , who would notice ? " <p> God does n't  want us to be against our cities but to be for them , partnering with city leaders and working for the welfare of those around us . I told our leadership team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking us out for the answers to community issues . <p> By Gods grace , we have seen this process begin to happen . No-strings-attached service is recognized and appreciated . I once heard a conference speaker ask , " If your church ceased to exist this week , other than your members , who would notice ? " That mental exercise has been a highly motivating part of our efforts and I can share with joy that there would be many in Duluth that would feel a void if FBCD ceased to exist . That mutually caring relationship keeps a church relevant and pays the price for continued ministry impact for the community . <p> What relevance is not <p> To talk about what relevance is , however , we must talk about what relevance is not . Too many churches have capitulated on serious issues in an attempt to be " relevant . " Relevance is not submitting to the new sexual norms of the culture . Relevance is not watering down the gospel . Relevance does not mean letting the rock band perform for an hour on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a vague , Christian-sounding topic with a couple of Bible verses pulled out of context . In order to be relevant , we must remember that the most relevant thing to every person of every ethnicity in every city for all time is the gospel of Jesus Christ . <p> Many churches , in the effort to be relevant , have focused on creating a gospel culture apart from gospel truth . This destroys our ability to be in the world but not of the world , and welcomes the world into our pulpits . On the other hand , many churches have hoped to maintain gospel truth with no regard for a gospel culture . This preaches to the world a gospel of condemnation , rather than a gospel of love , which is really no gospel at all .

My wife gave birth to our fourth daughter , Eden , who was born with Down syndrome , unexpectedly . Through the initial pain of the diagnosis , coupled with a long road of medical complications , the Lord opened our eyes to the ugly idolatry in our hearts of a sanctified American dream for our childrens lives . But in doing so , he also opened our eyes to a whole new ministerial world by giving us new lenses through which to seeas parents of a child with special needs . <p> Prior to Eden being born , I had no idea that 85 percent of families who have a child with a special need are un-churched , rendering this beautiful group of families as an essentially unreached people group . When one pauses long enough to think about the reasons for this , its easy to understand . Parents want to ensure their child is going to be well cared for . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave a " typical " child in a strangers care , let alone a child who is medically or developmentally fragile and possibly non-verbal . <p> Another reason this group of families is an " unreached people group " is because many churches have never taken the time to think and pray about ministering to a child who has a special need of some sort . Thus , they 're unprepared . Other churches are just scared . Sadly , some even act annoyed or like these children and their families are not deserving of effort . I 've actually heard stories of families being asked to not come back because their child was too disruptive , loud , messy , touchy , etc . So , families decide that attending a church gathering is too difficult , or worse , they conclude that while churches claim to be for the hurting , they 're only for a certain kind of hurting personone who wont take too much effort . <p> This is antithetical to the gospel and to King Jesus , who said , " Let the children come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has imprinted on every human being regardless of stage of development in the womb , age , ethnicity , socio-economic status or special need . Ministering to individuals with special needs is a sanctity of life and gospel issue just as much as fighting for the unborn . <p> The question is : How do we do this ? Here are three things that our church has found helpful in seeking to reach this unreached people group . <p> 1 . Learn the language <p> Like all faithful missionaries , you must understand the language , even basic verbiage . For example , do n't  refer to a child who does n't  have special needs as " normal . " Refer to them as " typical . " To refer to a child as " not-normal " plants a destructive seed in their heart and soul . <p> Additionally , refrain from terms such as " special needs kids . " Its more preferable to say " individuals " or " children with special needs . " You see , Eden is a not a Down syndrome kid , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to have Down syndrome . Down syndrome is not who she isit does n't  define her . Let 's beg Christ to define all of our kids and let that be the label that we attach to them . And obviously strike the " r " word from your vocabulary . Its offensive in any and all settings , even when used in a self-deprecating fashion . These are small wording tweaks that will communicate to parents and guests that your church is attempting to learn the language . <p> 2 . Learn to listen <p> Parents are the experts on their children , so we should listen to and work with them to sketch out what would be best for their child . At our church , we have coopted the " IEP , " or Individual Education Program , of the public school system and turned it into an " ISP , " or Individual Spiritual Program . We emphasize the first two letters of the acronym in order to accomplish what 's optimal for each child : <p> Individual : because each child with a special need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits all approach will not prove helpful . <p> Spiritual : ministering to an individual with special needs is not babysitting time . Its ministry . Teach the Word , and point them to Jesus . <p> 3 . Develop a culture of inclusion <p> Every person wants to be included , and this is just as true of individuals with special needs . Including them in a community has been proven to be most effective for helping them reach their full educational and spiritual potential .

@@100509181 @4709181/ <h> 6 ways to welcome college students home this summer <p> Summer is here , which means many college students have returned home from their universities . Many churches find it difficult to determine how to best welcome them back . Do you simply funnel them into your youth ministry programs ? Do you recruit them to help the other age-graded ministries ? Do you create some type of summer worship experience for them ? What 's the best way to welcome them back into our congregations ? Here are a few suggestions : <p> 1 . Acknowledge them . This may seem to be a basic suggestion , but its one worth mentioning . Many college students return to their local churches and do n't  have anyone reaching out to them . Chances are , if they 're back in your church , they were involved in your student ministry and church as a whole in high school . Why not have a pastor or small group leader reach out to them personally ? Let them know you 've missed them and that they add value to your church . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a valuable exercise to gather the college students you have and ask them what theyve learned about the culture . They have just returned from being immersed in the collegiate experience . Are there insights your church could gather from this exercise ? If " tomorrows leaders " are being produced on the college campuses , churches should take notice of what 's happening on those campuses . <p> One unique trait that college students will bring to your congregation is passion . <p> 3 . Plug them into visible roles . One tendency we can have with college students is to give them tasks with minimum responsibility and visibility . Some may be returning from college/campus ministries where they provided a lot of leadership and support . Why not leverage their passion and experience for their home church ? Have them lead a student ministry small group . Could they help in your Sunday service with the opening and prayer ? <p> One unique trait that college students will bring to your congregation is passion . Theyre passionate about God and life in general . They can inject a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing . Sure , you may have to help them stay grounded and focused , but the value of having them connected will far outweigh the work you 'll have to put in through redirecting their energy . <p> 4 . Connect them with a mentor . Many of your students may have been involved primarily with a campus ministry . What you can offer them that , perhaps , their campus ministry ca n't is an intentional relationship with a mature adult . One idea is to connect them with someone in the same career field they 're studying . Do you have an engineer in your congregation ? How about a school teacher ? Students need to see how they can use their specific vocation for Gods mission . You know your congregation better than anyone . Find out what your returning college students are studying , and then find them a matching mentor . Paul explicitly exhorts Timothy to " entrust to faithful men who are able to teach others also " ( 2 Tim . 2:2 ) and for " older women . . . to teach what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure the next generation is disciplied . <p> 5 . Create missional opportunities . If there 's one thing college students are passionate about its service opportunities . They want to make an impact in their community . They believe the gospel should motivate us to make a tangible difference in our communities . Is there a food pantry or homeless shelter than needs support ? Do you have elderly couples that need home repairs or someone to spend time with them ? These are all tasks college students could help fulfill . Who knows , they could build bridges for you with some businesses/organizations that you have wanted to connected with . <p> 6 . Be patient with them . This suggestion is a little different , but I think helpful . Some will return from college with grand ideas about life and how things should work . They might be critical of how things are done at your church ( if they stick around and do n't  find another church ) . College students will be naive about life . However , its not your job to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , they will quickly leave your church . At school , they 're taught to think critically . They are in a process of growth and maturity . Has God been patient with you ? Shouldnt that motivate us to be patient with them . <p> Paul instructs the church at Colossae to forgive and bear with one another ( Col. 3:12-13 ) . Let that motivate us to forgive and bear when necessary . Serve as their " emergency brake . " When they get moving too quickly or seem too critical , lovingly help them hit the brake . I have , at times , allowed students to do something that I know will fail simply to allow them to feel the failure . In those moments , we step in and help them assess why it went wrong and what could have been done better . Do n't  give up on them , and do n't  take their criticisms personal . <p> Depending on your location , college students have flooded into your community .

@@100509182 @4709182/ <h> 10 reasons taxpayers should defund Planned Parenthood <p> On Thursday , House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that as part of the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act , Republican congressional leaders would include a provision that would prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funding . <p> Here are ten reasons why every taxpayer should support congressional efforts to defund Planned Parenthood : <p> 1 . Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortions in Americaand the largest recipient of federal funding for family planning . <p> PPFA is also the largest single recipient of federal funding for family planning . A report produced by the by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2015 found that over a three year period ( 2010-2012 ) , PPFA received $344.5 million in direct federal funds and an additional $1.2 billion in funding from Medicaid ( which includes a combination of federal and state funds ) . Altogether , Planned Parenthood gets nearly a half a billion dollars every year from the American taxpayer . <p> 2 . Planned Parenthood covers up the crimes of rapists , pimps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taxpayer dollars accounted for at least 40 percent of all the corporations revenueand 100 percent of the corporations profits . As Americans United for Life notes , that is profit after paying all expenses , including not only its employees salaries and benefits ( such as the half a million dollars compensation to the corporations president ) but also over half a billion dollars for categories it describes in its reports as " public policy , " " building advocacy capacity , " " increase access , " " renew leadership , " " refresh our brand , " and " engage communities . Without this taxpayer funding it is unlikely that Planned Parenthood would be able to earn a profit or to fund their advocacy for abortion . <p> Planned Parenthood strongly opposes sex education that focuses on abstinence and has gone so far as to file lawsuits against school districts that have decided to implement abstinence-only programs . The organization claims to offer " value-neutral " sex education . ( As an example , on their website aimed at teenagers , they included an article that teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way to preserve the woman 's virginity . " ) <p> Investigations of Planned Parenthood financial data and practices conducted in 12 states found hundreds of thousands of abortion related claims were billed unlawfully to Medicaid . Auditors and investigators have specifically identified Planned Parenthood affiliates as the source of at least $12.8 million in waste , abuse , and potentially fraudulent overbilling and penalties . The audits also found numerous improper practices resulting in significant federal funding overpayments of more than $8.5 million , and overbilling of state family planning programs amounted to more than $123.8 million . <p> 6 . While taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood doubled , the number of cancer screenings they provided dropped by half <p> One of the justifications Planned Parenthood uses to acquire federal funding is the claim that they provide necessary medical services , such as cancer screening . But taxpayer funding of the abortion provider has doubled since 2005 while the number of cancer screening has been cut by 50 percent ( and the number of abortions provided increased by more than 12 percent ) . <p> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue for monetary gain <p> A recent Congressional investigation uncovered documents and received testimony from confidential informants indicating that four Planned Parenthood clinics may have violated federal law forbidding the transfer of fetal tissue for " valuable consideration . " Congress has referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for further investigation . <p> Some Planned Parenthood affiliates seem to be more concerned with making a sale on body parts than they are with securing their patients privacy . <p> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) established the Privacy Rule , which protects all individually identifiable health information by setting limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without patient authorization . A recent Congressional investigation found that several Planned Parenthood clinics violated this rule by disclosed patients individually identifiable health information in an effort to resale human fetal tissue obtained from abortions to a biomedical supply company . <p> For more than two decades , Planned Parenthood has consistently supported partial-birth abortion and opposed any efforts to ban this infanticidal practice . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the womb feet-first and into the birth canal , except for the head , which the abortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix .

Both a budget bill and a new health-care replacement measure proposed in the House of Representatives would slash funds for Planned Parenthood , which receives more than $500 million annually in government grants and reimbursements . <p> Planned Parenthoods top officers were unequivocal in their opposition to eliminating abortion after The Times reported the outreach to the organizations allies . <p> " Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion a necessary service that 's as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings , " tweeted Cecile Richards , president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ) March 6 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no Planned Parenthood , " Southern Baptist ethicist Russell Moore told Baptist Press in written comments . <p> Planned Parenthood " is not a health-care organization but a storefront for an industry that devalues human life and exploits families and communities , " said Moore , president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission ( ERLC ) . <p> " This is just another example of why Planned Parenthood deserves not a penny of taxpayer funding , " he said . " I pray that we will see the day soon when federal support of Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry is seen as a piece of history from a bygone , more morally confused time . " <p> R. Albert Mohler Jr. , president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a well-known cultural commentator , said the development shows Planned Parenthood is " monomaniacally committed to abortion .

" <p> Dawn Laguens , PPFAs executive vice president , tweeted March 6 , " Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept . <p> " Also , say it with me folks : Abortion is health care , " Laguens tweeted later in the day . <p> In acknowledging the offer , President Trump told The Times March 6 , " As I said throughout the campaign , I am pro-life and I am deeply committed to investing in womens health and plan to significantly increase federal funding in support of nonabortion services such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose public funding for abortion , even those who identify as pro-choice . There is an opportunity for organizations to continue the important work they do in support of womens health , while not providing abortion services . " <p> The effort to cut public funds for Planned Parenthood has grown through years marked by the organizations continued reception of large sums of government money , its performance of nearly one-third of the abortions in the United States while non-abortion services declined and a variety of scandals . <p> PPFA and its affiliates received $553.7 million in government grants and reimbursements in the organizations latest financial year , 2014-15 . Planned Parenthoods affiliates performed 323,999 abortions during 2013-14 , the most recent reporting year for which statistics are available . <p> The latest scandal was unveiled in 2015 , when a series of undercover videos provided evidence Planned Parenthood was trading in body parts from aborted babies .

" When I was a child ... " <p> In our house , the conversation ends with our eyes watching two blonde boys play on the floor . We wonder what their memories will be . What type of world will they live in ? Though I do n't  know the answers , I want to lead and inspire them to bravely face tomorrow . <p> In his book , Onward , Russell Moore wrote , " For a long time , the church in America has assumed ... that most people at least ideally wanted to live up to our conception of the good life . Those with eyes to see ought to recognize that if those days ever existed , they are no more . <p> " American culture is shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era in which religion is not necessarily seen as a social good . Christianity in its historic , apostolic form is increasingly seen as socially awkward at best , as subversive at worst . " <p> Christian parents , who are seeking to equip their children for the real world , will be facing thoughtful , ongoing conversations on gender , personhood , self-expression and marriage in unprecedented ways . Our children and our parenting will require multi-faceted bravery ; it will require multi-faceted bravery rooted in the work of Christ and his Word . <p> Yet , here are a few ways we can live bravely and lead our children to the same : <p> 1 . Demonstrate emotional bravery . <p> We must exhibit for our children emotional bravery that reflects personal vulnerability and dependence on the gospel . Its brave to repent and believe over and over again . When appropriate , confess your sins to your children and teach them to do the same . The message of Scripture is the message we give to the worldrepent , and believe . <p> The work of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociological theory . No other posture for cultural engagement inside or outside your home really works . You will not be the perfect example of Christian ethics that you hold before your children . But modeling for your children how to have difficult conversations with humility and grace will make a lasting and genuine impact on their lives . <p> 2 . Gird your loins . <p> Let 's go to the King James Version for Ephesians 6 . " Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness " ( Eph. 6:14 ) . <p> Now , let 's see what the English Standard Version says . " Stand therefore , having fastened on the belt of truth " ( Eph. 6:14 ) . <p> It 's important to see that in each version , there is a calling to be prepared . Even the apostle Paul urges the church in Corinth to " Be on your guard ; stand firm in the faith ; be courageous ; be strong " ( 1 Cor. 16:13 ) . <p> In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word , equipped for the daily rhythms of life . My child does n't  tell me a few weeks in advance exactly when he s going to drop a serious question . Does yours ? I recently read an account online of a mother who lied to her son to avoid a difficult discussion about gender . I have to admit , that temptation is palpable for me . <p> Yet from the simplistic questions of a five year-old to more complex discussions with teens , we must be rooted in the eternal truths of the Bible . There is such freedom in knowing that you are not just giving your best ideas to your children ; you are giving them the very words of Godliving and active ( 1 Pet . 4:11 , Heb. 4:12 ) . These words have purposeto give life and set the captives free ( John 10:10 , Isa. 61 ) . <p> I pray as I am preparing my boys to bravely take these truths to the world themselves . They are in a battlenot in the heavenly places . <p> We can not forget this . <p> In a world continuing to devalue Christian ethics , we must prepare our children to understand they will be outsiders . It not make you or your children popular . But Jesus plainly states that " Everyone will hate you because of me , but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved " ( Mark 13:13 ) . <p> 3 . Lift up heroes . <p> My boys are the descendants of homesteaders , soldiers and gospel ministers . Their lives are built upon some incredible legacies , and we talk about those heroes often . Even beyond our family , they stand upon a legacy of saints . Hebrews gives us the famous run-down of those who lived by faith and did not receive what was promised in this life but are now residing in the beautiful " city of the living God " ( Heb. 12:22 ) . When I send my boys out into the world , they might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tell your children stories of those who bravely threw all their hopes in Christ 's hands . Celebrate church history figures , missionaries and the godly men and women in your church . Celebrate those people , and integrate them into your familys life . Even the most brave will need encouragement , and the best heroes are the ones you know . <p> 4 . Live in hope . <p> Bravery does n't  exist without hope . One takes risks , goes to uncharted places or walks with eyes wide open into difficulty only when there is something of far greater worth than the arduous circumstances before him or her . <p> The author of Hebrews writes of hope as an anchor for the soul ( Heb. 6:19 ) . Point your children to the only source of true hope so when they deal with suffering , encounter those who disagree with them or lose worldly success in an ever-changing culture , they wo n't come untethered . <p> Today , friends , let us bravely place our hope in Christ , and our children into His hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@100509191 @4709191/ <h> 5 ways to love your gay neighbor <p> Jesus teaches us to " love the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our mind and with all our strength " ( Mark 12:30 ) . Furthermore , he teaches us to " love our neighbor as ourself " ( Mark 12:31 ) . This command to love our neighbor is rooted in Gods love for us . We take our cues from God when it comes to how we demonstrate love to others . Therefore , when it comes to loving those with whom we disagree or with whose lifestyles we can not condone , we must look to God for our example . <p> The following points represent a brief survey of some biblical truths from the writings of the apostle Paul that will help us love our gay neighbors well : <p> 1 . Love your gay neighbor fearlessly <p> " ... for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control " ( 2 Tim . 1:7 ) . <p> Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seasoned , mature Paul . Just like us , Timothy had to be reminded that God had given him a spirit of power , love , and self-control . Regardless of the circumstances , we are called to love our gay neighbor in the strength of Gods power , which drives out fear and increases our faith . Fearless love takes risks . It steps outside of its comfort zone . It breaks down stereotypes and demonstrates trust in God . <p> Gods compassion serves as the paradigm for Christian compassion . <p> 2 . Love your gay neighbor compassionately <p> " Put on then so you also must forgive " ( Col. 3:12-13 ) . <p> Gods compassion serves as the paradigm for Christian compassion . When we seek to show compassion to others , we begin by considering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gay neighbor , we show compassion and offer forgiveness on the basis of what God has done in Christ to redeem us and demonstrate his love toward us . Compassion is the clothing of the Christian . It is the scent that should linger when a Christian comes around . <p> 3 . Love your builds itself up in love " ( Eph. 4:15-16 ) . <p> Biblical love is inextricably related to the truth . If the source of love is God himself , then our expressions of love must not neglect the truth of God . Love and truth are the two sides of the Gospel we share with others . People will never see how loved they truly are until they understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Christians conceal the truth about sin from their neighbor , it may appear loving , but it is not loving at all . Loving our gay neighbor in the truth means not only addressing the reality and consequence of the sin , but it also means faithfully declaring the grace and freedom that are found in Christ Jesus . Christians should speak the whole truth to their gay neighbor , which means truthful speech about both Gods just holiness and Gods redemptive mercy . <p> 4 . Love your gay neighbor redemptively <p> " But when the goodness and loving kindness of of the Holy Spirit , whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior , so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life . " ( Titus 3:4-7 ) . <p> The " loving kindness of God our Savior appeared " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a salvific purpose . The end goal of his love is the redemption of the sinner . We are told this in no uncertain terms in John 3:16 , where we read that Gods love for us compelled him to send his Son , Jesus , into the world for the salvation of sinners . He does not love for loves sake , but for the sake of his glory in salvation . Our love for our gay neighbor is incomplete if its end goal is not their full redemption . We are called to adorn the gospel with our good works , but we must be careful that we do not neglect the gospel on account of our busyness . <p> 5 . Love your gay neighbor patiently <p> " I therefore , a prisoner for the Lord , urge you to walk in a manner bond of peace " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone , able to teach , patiently enduring evil , correcting his opponents with gentleness . God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth " ( 2 Tim . 2:24-25 ) . <p> Very few people respond to the gospel the first time that they hear it . As those who have been saved by a patient God , we need to be patient with our gay neighbor . Furthermore , while our love must be redemptive , it must not be dehumanizing . What I mean by this is that our gay neighbor is not some salvific notch in our evangelistic belt . We must not view our neighbor as a threat to be neutralized , but as a human being created in the image of a loving and patient God . We should demonstrate love to our gay neighbor regardless if they ever attend our church meetings . So when we start loving our neighbors redemptively , we must do so with patience and longsuffering . Often , repentance will be messy and we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Jesus . We must not give up on the gospel . In due season , Gods message will bear fruit if we do not grow weary in doing good . <p> In conclusion , Gods Word is clear that we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves . This necessarily includes even those with whom we disagree and whose lifestyles conflict with Gods Word . Gods intention is to use Christians to demonstrate a love for their gay neighbor that is marked by a fearless hope in the transforming truth of the gospel , which declares the compassion of God toward all sinners with the aim of bringing about their full redemption . This love is a patient love that rests in the sovereign kindness of a loving God . It is a love that looks strikingly similar to the love that God has poured out on us through Jesus Christ . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Nineteen years ago , my wife and I began a journey .

I gave work email permission to steal my attention , favoring the short-term " productivity " over the benefits of prolonged , concentrated effort . I was gorging myself on information , news stories , articles on this website and other Christian resources . Even my morning commute was filled by podcasts . Trying to consume content during every empty millisecond felt like the right thing to do in our information age . <p> It was n't until the temptation was removed that I realized how much time I spent distracted , disrupted and exhausted .

Not much . <p> We have a new president , but the same King . <p> Remember the time Jesus asked his disciples , " Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? " They gave a few answers of who other people were speculating about who he was . Then Jesus asked , " But you , who do you say that I am ?

I recall another time in history when Gods people got their way with a ruler . The surrounding nations had a king , so they thought they needed one too . Instead of honoring their king and trusting God , they trusted their king and forgot their God . It was a good run , but not for long . <p> We should pray for Mr. Trump and that his administration will create a better environment for life and liberty in America , but we should only bow to and depend on the King Immortal , Invisible , God only Wise . <p> We have a new president , but the same enemy . <p> I woke up this morning to pray for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain that sin has left in their wake . The husband who is leaving his family still wo n't return my calls . That teenager is still fighting against her mental demons .

That couple is still sacrificing their family on the altar of the American dream . <p> Satan is feeling no post-election blues . He knows our tendency is to place our affections on the things of earth and to idolize our leaders . He knows that if a Trump presidency makes evangelicals feel like winners , then he is still in play . The apostle Peter wrote : <p> Be serious ! Be alert ! Your adversary the Devil is prowling around like a roaring lion , looking for anyone he can devour . 1 Peter 5:8 <p> Whoever occupies the White House , our enemy is the same . He loses in the end , but until then , he seeks to destroy everything and everyone we love . So let us be sober and be alert , and keep our eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same neighbors . <p> If about half the country voted for Mrs. Clinton , then it is reasonable to assume that many of the people around us did too .

Today , they are disappointed , and they are anxious . <p> The rest of our neighbors , who presumably voted for Mr. Trump , are likely optimistic and satisfied with the results . They believe that he will bring new hope for them and for our nation . But they will be disappointed sooner or later with his performance . <p> Jesus said that our second greatest responsibility , after loving his Father , is to love our neighbors as ourselves .

Today is a great day to show and share the Good News of Jesus with them . <p> We have a new president , but the same calling . <p> Government has the power to make the mission of the church easier or more difficult , but it does not have the power to change the mission of the church . The church can thrive under various forms of government , but it can not thrive if it compromises on Jesus calling to make disciples who make disciples . <p> We can celebrate wins or grieve losses , but Jesus did not leave us here to garner political power .

And then let us embrace the work of the evangelist so that we may win the world as the Day draws near . <p> We have a new president , but the same home . <p> I love America , but this is still not my home . During Jesus and Pilates sobering conversation , Jesus reminded the governor : <p> " My kingdom is not of this world , " said Jesus . " If My kingdom were of this world , My servants would fight , so that I would n't be handed over to the Jews . As it is , My kingdom does not have its origin here .

When Gods people were exiled in Babylon , the prophet Jeremiah wrote , <p> This is what the Lord of Hosts , the God of Israel , says to all the exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon : 5 " Build houses and live in them . Plant gardens and eat their produce . 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters . Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters .

My generation baby-proofed our homes , obsessed over the safest car seats and boycotted sleepovers . But as hard as we 've tried , we cant avoid suffering . An example of this is found in an eye-opening article for the November 7 issue of Time , where Susanna Schrobsdorff tells us the pre-teens and teenagers we 've raised are more anxious , overwhelmed and depressed than the generation before . <p> Over six million teens in the U.S. have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder , which is 25 percent of the teen population . After several years of stability , depression among high school kids is rising . According to the Department of Health and Human Services , 12.5 percent of adolescents , ages 12 to 17 , had at least one major depressive episode in 2015 . That 's up from 4.6 percent in 2006 . <p> The signature symptom <p> While not universal among kids with depression and anxiety , Schrobsdorff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptom of this generations mental health difficulties .

She sat on the edge of the tub at her home and sliced into her ribs with the metal clip from a pen : " There was blood and a sense of deep relief . " <p> These sobering statistics and stories like Faith-Anns raise questions for parents . What caused this rise in anxiety among teenagers ? What can I do to prevent my child from hiding depression ? What should I do if I discover my child is cutting ? <p> The link between mental health and technology <p> Schrobsdorff focuses on potential causes . Shes particularly interested in links between teenage mental health and their use of technology : " Conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even though teens may be in the same room with their parents , they might also , thanks to their phones , be immersed in a painful emotional tangle with dozens of their classmates .

Experts warn against the addictive distraction from schoolwork and the danger of exposing kids to online bullies , child predators and sexting . Such realities call for the same vigilance with Internet safety we 've demonstrated in baby-proofing . Parents should know how to set up a phones restrictions and find a plan that allows for monitoring text messages . And parents must teach skills for navigating the world of social media by first limiting access , then giving increasing freedom as their children demonstrate growing responsibility . <p> But even with these precautions , a more subtle danger in children having smartphones is exposing kids to a deep experience of their own feelings before they have the skills to process them .

" <p> Helping teens work through their feelings <p> It shouldnt surprise us when kids who are more socially connected gain a greater awareness of the worlds brokenness and feel deeply about it . Dr. Brent Bounds , a clinical psychologist who served as director of Family Ministries at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York , says its important to create a culture where its safe to talk about these emotions when they come . Parents cant force vulnerability , but we can model it . And we can let kids know that it is not wrong to feel deeply . <p> Our goal should n't be to change how they feel but simply recognize our kids emotions and affirm our love . Bounds told me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to make their child feel safe . But one of the most freeing answers a parent can give their child is , I do n't know . But I love you and I want to support and help you any way I can. " <p> When conversation is open with a teen , parents can simply reflect back what their child may be feeling " You seem really angry right now . I wonder if you 're angry with me and do n't know how to talk about it ? " or , " Wow , that 's a really hard situation . I can imagine you feel overwhelmed . " Using this same reflecting technique , a parent can help build a childs emotional vocabulary from an early age . This will prepare kids to face more complex feelings when they enter the teen years . <p> Helping our children grow in self-awareness about their emotions is a pathway to helping them grow in self-care as well .

Acknowledge the teens courage and then listen . Its hard to do . Bounds observes , " Most parents are understandably concerned when they find out a child is cutting , but they tend to react in ways that do n't draw out the teen but instead shut them down . " <p> Know that its not out of the norm for a teen to cut themselves at some point . The important questions to ask are : Where did they cut ? ( Alarming areas are inside wrists , forearms and the inner thigh . ) What did they use to cut themselves ? And how much/often has this happened ?

" The desire may come from a childs deep belief that she 's not big enough to contain the feelings she is experiencing . The desire to cut may even be a deep emotional witness to the truth that growing social awareness or social advocacy will not atone for the worlds sins . Our brokenness is only healed with the shedding of blood ( Heb. 9:22 ) ; but its the Saviors , not our own . <p> As Dr. Scott James , a pediatric physician/researcher and an elder at The Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham , Ala. , cautioned me , its not absolutely necessary for us to come to a full explanation of why this is happening : <p> I 've learned as a doctor that when it comes to mental health , I need to disabuse myself of the notion that I will always be able to pop the hood and get to the bottom of what a patient is feeling/doing .

From that place of humility , we can point to Christ , the true comforter and healer . Jesus understands .

That 's true ; the church is a kindred people committed to one another for the advancement of the gospel . The misguided implication , however , is that the regular meeting of committed Christians in a particular place and a specific time is of secondary importance a good option , but an option nonetheless . <p> As the writer of Hebrews called us to draw near to God through a new and living way that is Christ , he also challenged us to hold on to our confession " without wavering " because God is faithful . And in light of the promise that God will not leave us , the Holy Spirit inspired the writer to command us to the same faithfulness to one another : " And let us be concerned about one another in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our worship meetings , as some habitually do , but encouraging each other , and all the more as you see the day drawing near " ( Heb. 10:24-25 ) . <p> Apparently , as early as the first century , habitual church skipping was a thing . Some Christians had developed a pattern of prioritizing other activities , which kept them away from worship meetings , and they were called out for it . The author here risked being labeled a legalist in order to rebuke believers for neglecting the responsibility they had to attend church . In essence , he reminded them that the church meeting is not an option , but rather an essential practice for the faithful follower of Christ . <p> Why is that ? If we are in Christ , and we love God , why should attending a church meeting every week be a priority ? If the church will survive without us , why does it matter ? If we are living moral lives and showing respect for Christian values , what is the big deal ? If we are practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The nature of the church <p> These are legitimate questions .

Church attendance is a common practice in our particular culture , but its somehow disconnected from our view of God and our part in his eternal story of redemption . <p> Recent efforts have been made to make the church more relevant with themes like , " The church is not a place , but a people , " or " The church has left the building . " The point is well made that church is not simply an event to attend , but a people who live everyday on mission with God . And now technology allows people to " attend " church by watching the music and preaching through online streaming .

Or we could look at Adam and Eves relationship in the Garden of Eden . Or we could see how the people of God were organized into a community of faith that met regularly for worship in the Old Testament . But perhaps the most helpful model for us is in Acts . <p> After Jesus ascension , his disciples returned to Jerusalem , and they were " continually united in prayer " ( Acts 1:14 ) . And then we read that about 120 believers were gathered together as Peter preached . On the day of Pentecost , they were " all together in one place , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church movement was born . That was a unique experience , but their gatherings did not end there . Soon after that , " every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple complex , and broke bread from house to house .

Christians did not form communes . Instead , they lived out their faith in their homes and in the marketplace every day , but they also met in groups and established churches that met regularly for united prayer , study , fellowship , ministry , evangelism and worship . <p> Every church was unique . The time of day , the type of place and the order of service were likely very different as churches were planted throughout Asia Minor , but the priority was the same . This is what the writer of Hebrews commands us to not neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfulness , we must not neglect our regular meetings together . <p> Our call to interdependence <p> The context of the Hebrews exhortation is important . Our new and living way in Christ compels us to a new and living way with his people . Our personal relationship with God through our perfect High Priest never encourages personal independence . Instead , it is the basis for our interdependence . Gods faithful , never-leave-us-alone relationship with us compels us to build committed relationships with one another through the local church . And it is that kindred heart among believers that validates the message of the gospel ( John 17 ) . <p> The incarnation of Jesus calls us to an ongoing incarnational ministry to one another , and " all the more as we see the day drawing near " ( Heb. 11:25 ) .

Since the end of World War II the most direct challenges to life and human dignity came from the Netherlands and the nations cultural and legal acceptance of the " right to die . " The medical community and broader citizenry have so embraced the right to choose death that even parents of gravely i 'll children can now have doctors speed up their death . <p> In almost any other country on earth such a policy might be considered radical and shocking . But in the Netherlandsthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick children merely decriminalized a practice that has been occurring for decades . An examination of how this formerly conservative , tradition-bound culture could adopt what the modern Hippocratic Oath refers to as " therapeutic nihilism " is useful for understanding how other nationsincluding the United Stateswill likely begin to accept euthanasia in the near future . <p> The Liberalization of Sex , Drugs , and Death <p> As occurred in many Western countries during the 1960s , the people of the Netherlands began to reject traditional authority structures in favor of increased individual freedom . While the change led most visibly to a liberalization of attitudes toward sex and drugs , it also carried over into the role of doctors and patients , particularly in the expansion of patients rights and patient autonomy . <p> In 1969 the influential physician J. H. Van den Berg published Medische macht en medische ethiek ( " Medical power and medical ethics " ) , which argued that medical technology was making doctors more powerful . According to Van den Berg , doctors , when bound by Hippocratic ethics , are morally required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious interpretation of the oath and its meaning ) . But in the age of advanced medical technology , he argued , the ancient creed posed new ethical problems . On the basis of this revised ethical code , Berg argued not only for voluntary euthanasia but also for the involuntary killing of individuals who suffer from reduced quality of life , such as elderly patients suffering from dementia . <p> After the release of Van den Bergs book , end-of-life issues began to be included in the debates on patients rights . But while public sentiment was evolving rapidlybecoming much more tolerant of assisted suicide and euthanasiathe law was slower to conform . Despite legal prohibitions against euthanasia and assisted suicide , which had been part of Dutch law since the Dutch Penal Code replaced the French Code Penal in 1886 , euthanasia become increasingly common . <p> A Doctor Kills His Mother <p> A turning point occurred in 1973 when Dr. Geertruida Postma was convicted of killing her elderly mother , but on such grounds and with such limited punishment that the conviction had the practical effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euthanasia . In this landmark case , the criminal court ruled that it was possible to administer pain-relieving drugs leading to the death of the patient provided the purpose of treatment was the relief of physical or psychological pain arising from an incurable terminal illness . Because Postmas primary goal was to cause the death of her patient , she was found guilty and received a one week suspended sentence and one years probation . <p> The ruling marked a notable shift in the law , allowing the formulation of conditions under which life could be deliberately shortened by doctors . The minimal punishment and light sentence also sent a clear signal that cases of euthanasia would be treated mildly by the judicial system . The result was that the publicly popular practice , while not yet decriminalized , began to be carried out more regularly and routinely , but without a studied understanding of its prevalence or the circumstances under which it was administered . <p> Euthanasia and Matters of Murder <p> In 1990 , the Dutch government set up a Commission , chaired by Attorney General Jan Remmelink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the law . Using the narrow definition of euthanasia as " active termination of life upon the patients request , " the Remmelink report concluded that 2,300 instances of euthanasia were carried out during 1990 . And while the Royal Dutch Medical Association ( KNMG ) had established in its Guidelines for Euthanasia that terminating a life without a patients request is " juridically a matter of murder or killing and not of euthanasia , " the Remmelink Commission found , through interviews with randomly selected physicians and mailed questionnaires , that over 20,000 life-ending actions had been taken in 1990 without the patients express consent . <p> These " matters of murder " do not include , as the report notes , the unknown numbers of disabled newborns , children with life-threatening conditions , or psychiatric patients who may have been killed involuntarily but were not included in the survey . <p> Rather than being disturbed by the findings , the Commission glossed over these instances of involuntary killing by claiming that " active intervention " was usually " inevitable " because of the patient 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded not by tightening controls on doctors but by implementing the Commissions recommendation to establish in statutory form the report physicians who practice euthanasia should file with the local medical examiner .

In 2014 , that number had increased to 5,306 assisted deaths , including 41 assisted deaths for psychiatric reasons and 81 assisted deaths for dementia . <p> As Dutch ethicist Theo Boer wrote earlier this year , " For no apparent reason , beginning in 2007 , the numbers of assisted dying cases started going up by 15 percent each year . In 2014 the number of cases stood at 5,306 , nearly three times the 2002 figure .

Legislation to decriminalize euthanasia , which had been repeatedly proposed since 1984 , was finally passed on April 10 , 2001 .

A survey by the NIPO Institute in 1998 found that 77 percent of the populace favored non-voluntary euthanasia while only 76 percent favored voluntary euthanasia .

As reported in one Dutch documentary , a young woman in remission from anorexia was concerned that her eating disorder would return . To prevent a relapse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complied with her request . <p> Death for those suffering from life <p> The anorexia example is horrifying , but at least in that instance an actual physical illness was involved . As the most recent legislative proposal shows , some advocates of the practice consider the presence of a debilitating illness or physical suffering as too stringent a prerequisite for permitting euthanasia . <p> The Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society ( DVES ) , for example , was generally pleased with the relaxation of euthanasia laws , but it was disappointed that the law continued to forbid the killing of people who are simply tired of living . " We think that if you are old , you have no family near , and you are really suffering from life , " said DVES spokesperson Walburg de Jong , " then euthanasia should be possible . " <p> Days after the change in the law , Dutch health minister Els Borst admitted in an interview that she had no problems with providing " suicide pills " for elderly citizens who were simply " bored sick " with living . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 found that more than one in five Dutch people believe that euthanasia should be allowed for elderly people who are " tired of living . " ) And another poll in 2015 found that Dutch doctors would willingly euthanize anyone who was , " tired of living , with medical grounds for suffering but in the absence of a severe physical or psychiatric disease . " <p> Perhaps the most significant shift in the public acceptability of voluntary euthanasia occurred in the summer of 1991 , crystallizing around another important legal case . Psychiatrist Boudewijn Chabot treated a woman whom he gave the fictional name of " Netty Boomsma . " The woman was suffering from grief over the loss of her youngest son to cancer at the age of twenty . Her eldest son was also dead , having killed himself two years earlier after being rejected by his girlfriend . Boomsma , who had a long history of depression , approached Chabot with the understanding that he would assist her suicide if she did not change her mind about wanting to die . <p> Although the crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chabot treated Boomsma for only two months before fulfilling his promise . Four months after the loss of her youngest son to cancer , Chabot gave Boomsma the lethal agent she needed to kill herself . While listening to the sounds of the same Bach flute sonata that had played at her sons funeral , the grieving mother took the medication and asked the psychiatrist : " Why do young kids want suicide ? " Thirty minutes later she was dead . <p> With the aid of the psychiatrist , the mother was able to end her life and fulfill her desire to be buried between the graves of her two sons . In his defense , Chabot insisted that Boomsma was not depressed , nor even a real patient . She was , he claimed , simply a grieving woman who wanted to die . Many Dutch therapists insist that there is an obligation to assist in the suicide of a patient with suicidal ideation if treatment has not succeeded . <p> But Chabot provided only minimal treatment : The despairing patient became her own diagnostician , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case to the coroner , Chabot was prosecuted for violating Dutch law , but the case was appealed to the countrys supreme court , which upheld the precedent set by the Leeuwarden criminal court in 1973 that pain relief that runs the risk of shortening life is acceptable when helping a patient suffering from a terminal condition . <p> The court found that Chabot was guilty of not having provided an adequate psychiatric review of the patients case before assisting with the suicide . However , the court imposed no penalty on Chabot , and the legal ruling established the precedent that physical illness was not a requirement for providing " pain relief " that ends a life when the request is voluntary , well-considered , and reviewed by a second physician . Suicidal depression became a terminal disease ; psychic distress became a legitimate ground for doctor-assisted death . <p> While the Supreme Courts decision was hailed as a victory by euthanasia supporters , it took more than ten years before the medical community openly agreed that neither a terminal illness nor physical suffering should be necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KNMG concluded in January 2005 that doctors should be able to kill patients who are not i 'll but who are judged to be " suffering through living . " <p> Jos Dijkhuis , the emeritus professor of clinical psychology who led the inquiry , said that it was " evident to us that Dutch doctors would not consider euthanasia from a patient who is simply tired of , or through with , life. " Instead , the committee agreed on the term " suffering through living , " because a patient may present a variety of physical and mental complaints that can lead them to conclude that life is unbearable . " In more than half of cases we considered , doctors were not confronted with a classifiable disease , " said Dijkhuis . " In practice the medical domain of doctors is far broader . . . . We believe a doctors task is to reduce suffering , therefore we cant exclude these cases in advance . We must now look further to see if we can draw a line and if so where . " <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years , the Dutch have continued the search for where to draw the line with euthanasia , shifting from acceptance of voluntary euthanasia for the terminally i 'll , to voluntary euthanasia for the chronically i 'll , to non-voluntary euthanasia for the sick and disabled , to euthanasia for those who are not sick at all but are merely alcoholics or " suffering through living . " <p> While the initial impetus may have been spurred by a desire to give expanded rights to the person who faces extreme suffering or imminent death , the effect has been to concentrate power into the hands of state-sponsored medical professionals . And while the justification for assisted death is usually the supposed well being of the suffering patient , the Dutch have redefined natural dependency into an unacceptable or unwanted social burden . <p> This increasing acceptance of euthanasia in the Netherlands is inversely proportional to the decline of Christianity in the country . In the mid-1960s , about 65 percent of the nation was Christian . Today , that same percentage ( 67 percent ) claim no affiliation . Slightly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 17 percent believe in the existence of God . <p> The Dutch sought autonomy from God , which led to a radical embrace of autonomy for the individual . Not surprisingly , the rejection of the Author of Life has led to a Culture of Death in the Netherlands . Faced with the many pains , heartaches , and disabilities that eventually afflict most of us in one form or another , and having no ultimate Redeemer to turn to , the Dutch are resorting euthanasia to quell their distress . <p> Euthanasia came to Europe through the agnosticism and atheism of the Netherlands . The experience on that continent should serve as a warning that when a nation ceases to believe in God , they embrace collective suicide carried out one person at a time . 43169 @qwx903169 43179 @qwx903179 43175 @qwx903175

We both were struggling with our identitiesmy sexual identity and her identity as a woman and a wife . Our marriage had been shattered , and both of us , in unique and personal ways , had experienced a profound and fresh connection with our Savior . <p> We knew we needed the local church , but we were not excited about finding one . On one hand , we desperately wanted a place where we could be honest and real about our struggles . On the other hand , most churches that seemed more open to our struggles also seemed vague and nebulous about homosexuality and sexual sin . In some ways , I felt safe in those churches as I imagined they would not reject me for my struggle . But in greater ways , I was leery of those churches . I knew I was vulnerable , and their nuanced language and unclear answers made me fear that their pastors might , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God was calling me to lay down at the cross . <p> We ended up back at a Baptist church , where we kept our struggles a secret but where we received good , solid teaching . God shored up our spiritual foundation in that place , and it was instrumental in our healing . Joyfully , we later found a church that figured out how to meld authenticity with a deep commitment to Gods Word . Our healing was exponential in that place ! <p> Today , many mainline denominations are no longer vague on sexuality at all and have moved to a place of fully and clearly affirming homosexual identity and expression . In addition to these historically more liberal churches , conservative evangelical churches , seemingly motivated by both the cultural wave of pro-gay sentiment and a genuine desire to share the gospel in the gay community , have made great strides in crafting a message for the gay community that is designed to be less-offensive , less argumentative and more inclusive . I appreciate those efforts and laud any message that opens the gospel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fear that churches which have chosen to speak more kindly and nuanced on issues like homosexuality and sexual sin , or which have chosen to say nothing for fear of saying too much , might be trying to reach one disconnected group outside the church at the cost of neglecting an important group within the church . In our desire to be more welcoming to and accepting of the gay community , have we shut our doors to the community of the conflicted and repentant ? <p> Are we as safe for repentant gay men and women as we are for the unrepentant ? <p> Homosexual expression may not be a sin worse than any other sin , but it is unique as the only sinful behavior that carries with it an identity that is protected , celebrated and endorsed on an increasingly broad scale . When someone chooses to walk away from homosexuality , based on the work of the Spirit in their hearts to both convict them of their sin and to give them hope for something more , they are not just walking away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreams and hopes and , in many ways , safety . <p> I remember well the pull , in the early days , back to my gay community . It was not so much lust that compelled me , but a sense of being OK and being accepted and loved based on my homosexuality . Had my church in any way endorsed as OK what I had left behind , I 'm not sure I would have stayed the course . And had I not stayed the course , I would not have discovered the amazing life God had for me as I lived out my repentance and grew into all that he made me to be and all that he had for me within his perfect boundaries for sexuality . <p> Both the lost world and the saved world need a clear word on the nature of sin and the way that nature reveals itself in our behavior . <p> Diminishing or skimming over parts of Gods Word , so as not to offend , helps no one .

There was no nuance in the proclamations of the Old Testament prophets . And Jesus and the New Testament writers never minced wordson sin or on love . The church need not fear the hard words about sin and must not ignore the hard words of love . Sin destroys , and if we really believe that , we wo n't fear calling sin out . Love restores , and if we really believe that , we will extend it , in the context of truth , to the repentant and the unrepentant alike . <p> The early days of repentance , no matter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work to convince repentant sinners that repentance was not necessary or that what they have left behind is more valuable than what they have turned toward .

God designed the church to stand with repentant sinnersencouraging them , teaching them , challenging them , supporting them and loving them as they go through the withdrawals that always accompany walking away from the mind-altering , numbing nature of sinful behavior . If we ignore the call to repentance because we want to attract the unrepentant , we will have nothing real to offer the unrepentant when they show up . And we will , perhaps inadvertently , minimize the magnitude of the miracle of conviction in those who are moved to repentance . <p> May we never , as the church , sacrifice the repentant in order to attract the unrepentant . <p> There may be few who choose to enter that narrow gate , but heaven celebrates over each one .

The discovery came as a complete shock to the mother who said it was out of character for her daughter to engage in such a risky behavior . She was a straight-A student and involved in extracurricular activities . In addition to having two loving and engaged parents in the home , she also had many close friends and was involved in her church youth group . <p> The mother went on to share that after several counseling sessions , the root of the problem had been discovered . They had recently allowed their daughter to use a popular social media app with some time limitations and protective boundaries in place . She was required to keep her account private and give her mother her login information so her mother could monitor her activity from time to time . Even so , the mother did n't  notice any unusual activity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the problem . There were no comments that implied bullying . Nor was there any contact from a stranger making inappropriate requests . Her daughter confessed to the counselor that she began cutting herself because she felt worthless when she compared herself to everyone elses highlight reel . The triggers werent obvious , but at the same time , they were out in the open for all to see . <p> Her daughter struggled to understand why some of her friends pictures got more likes than her pictures . Or why some of the girls she thought were her friends did n't  mutually follow her back . She was stressed over pictures of girls who she perceived to be prettier and more fashionable and had the comments and likes from the popular boys to prove it , or the pictures of some of her friends hanging out together , without her . She began to obsess over perfectly timed posts with witty status updates that might garner her more likes and followers , but it never seemed to be enough . The more time she spent on the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's a parent to do ? How can we help our daughters reject the cultures shallow standards for defining worth and raise them to see themselves through Gods eyes ? <p> Here are three things we can do to help : <p> Take an honest assessment of the messages you are sending in your own home when it comes to worth . Do you put an unhealthy focus on outer appearance , body image , name brands or fashion ? Are talents , awards and achievements emphasized in your home more than character qualities ? Do you allow extra curricular activities to be a priority over church and other faith-based activities ? What has a greater influence on you : what others think or what God thinks ( or what his Word says ) ? The truth is , weve all been guilty of basing our worth on the worlds standards and for most of us , it will be a constant , life-long struggle to reject the lie . By admitting to our own vulnerability to define our worth according to the cultures standards , we meet our daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <p> Take advantage of teachable moments . Your daughter will be bombarded day in and day out with messages that support the cultures shallow definitions of worth . Whether its the lyrics to her favorite song , an ad encouraging her to cultivate her sex appeal for male attention or the steady stream of her friends and classmates seemingly perfect pictures and posts on social media , there will be no shortage of opportunities to point out the lies and remind her where true worth can be found . <p> Tell her where true worth can be found . Make a list of scripture verses that will help encourage your daughter to base her identity in Christ and refer to them on a consistent basis . ( *See below for verses to help jumpstart your effort . ) Commit to memorize some of the verses together or post them in key places to serve as a daily reminder ( the bathroom mirror , her locker or as the background on her phone or tablet ) .

@@100509209 @4709209/ <h> A call to empathy : Getting to know our neighbors <p> There 's no doubt that many tables will be divided during this holiday season for various reasons . But as the discussions begin and potential tempers flare , Christians can exercise self-control and remember there is a greater reason for our engagement on important topics . <p> There 's a great need for the display of empathy in this day . Empathy , by definition , is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another . The Word of God describes this as love : " Love your neighbor as yourself " ( Matt. 22:39 ) . As we exercise this radical and supernatural love , it leads us to act out of empathy , to rejoice and weep with others : " Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep " ( Rom. 12:15 ) . <p> Biblical love allows us to forgive and put-off offenses : " Above all , keep loving one another earnestly , since love covers a multitude of sin " ( 1 Peter 4:8 ) . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does no wrong to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law " ( Rom. 13:10 ) . <p> But how do we grow in empathy , especially during tense times ? How do we understand and share the feelings of another ? James would say that part of our growth in loving others practically starts by being quick to hear , slow to speak and slow to anger ( James . 1:20 ) . Growing in empathy starts by listening to others . In order to encourage you to exercise empathy , especially during this holiday season , here are the voices of five women and their empathetic reflections . <p> Christian Walker Kids City Director Redemption City Church <p> I 've lived a very homogeneous life . Most of the people who have surrounded me look and think just like me . I 've never actually had deep friendships with others from different racial backgrounds . I grew up thinking that minority struggles , particularly for African-Americans , were something to be glossed over . I 've heard family members and friends say things like : " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad ? " <p> Its easy for me to see how people who have never had an honest conversation or relationship with a person of another race can be apathetic . If most peoples experiences are like my own , it was n't an intentional apathy . I guess that 's why indifference is a special type of sin , because it is blinding . <p> In 2016 , we experienced an ugly election campaign , intense racial divides in communities all across the nation and a vote to remove the Confederate flag as a symbol of hatred at the Southern Baptist Convention . My sweet grandmother , who is very educated and intelligent , debated with me over the symbol of the Confederate flag . Her response to the Civil Rights Movement was , " I am very friendly to blacks . When I pass a black lady on the sidewalk , we smile at each other . " <p> After I picked my jaw up off the floor , I realized her lack of understanding came directly from her lack of relationship . My grandmother is not a racist person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance between her and those around her is wide . <p> I realized that I might have said the same thing without my relationship with Trillia . She has opened up her heart and shared personal feelings with me . My understanding of pain and hurt for my African-American brothers and sisters comes directly from my personal friendship with a woman of another race . <p> I pray everyone would have the opportunity for a friendship with someone from another tribe and another tongue who could help us develop greater understanding and empathy for others . <p> Catherine Parks Author of A Christ Centered Wedding <p> I do n't think empathy comes naturally . It certainly has n't for me . Proverbs 18:2 says , " A fool takes no pleasure in understanding , but only in expressing his opinion . " If that does n't sum up the echo chamber of this past year , I do n't know what does . The Philippian church had to be instructed to not just look out for their own interests , but also for the interests of others ( Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of humility required to do this . Humility is a necessity when we choose to set aside our own opinions in order to truly understand and hear one another . <p> Many wise people have said that empathy requires proximity . I certainly would n't understand some of the issues facing Mexican immigrants without my neighbors , the challenges to people with disabilities if it werent for my friends and the fears of some of my African-American brothers and sisters if it were n't for relationships with Trillia and others . <p> I have no doubt that each of these people have been patient and long suffering with my questions and ignorance at times . It is n't an easy burden to bearto be gently educating others constantlybut they have done it with love . Perhaps that is their Philippians 2:4 obedience . Maybe all along they have known something I did n't . <p> I always assume I 'm the one looking out for their interests by understanding them , and I think that 's somewhat true . But I 've realized they are also looking out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experiences , they are giving me a glimpse of the grandness of God 's design for humanity , and especially the beauty of his Body . They are giving me an opportunity to step outside my limited , self-absorbed , daily existence in order to participate in something far greater . <p> Courtney Reissig Author of Glory in the Ordinary and The Accidental Feminist <p> As Christians , our response to those who are different than us should never be fear . While our natural bent might be to retreat from otherness , Christs call on our lives is to empathy and understanding . In Christ , we have no need to fear . <p> First , to truly empathize we need to see our brothers and sisters as image bearers , not as " others " ( Gen. 1:27 ) . Bearing the image of God is our great leveler . Before the Lord , we are all created equal , we are all valued , and we all deserve to be heard . Our image bearing should drive us to seek to understand those who are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with that , we must also recognize that the privilege and majority status of some of us does not make our vantage point the superior one . We should be compelled to use these things for good , not our own gain . We should treat others as we would like to be treated , which means listening , understanding and advocating for those who are oppressed and misunderstood ( Luke 6:23 ) . This privilege is a call to stewardship not prejudice . God did n't  create one ethnicity or cultural experience . He created many , and this forces us to confront our own biases as the majority . People of privilege have a responsibility to listen first , talk later ( James 1:19 ) <p> In all of this , our greatest model for empathy is our Savior , Jesus . He went to people who were despised , rejected and outcasts of society . If image-bearing is the great leveler , the gospel levels us even more . In Christ , we have one Savior and one Church ( 1 Tim . 2:5 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of grace , not ethnicity , class or majority status ( John 14:6 ; Gal . 3:28 ) . The path to heaven is filled with people not like us , because God is calling all nations to himself . Let this fuel us to love and listen to those who are n't  like us , not turn away in fear or anger . <p> Where is empathy ? I wonder where others were when I poured out my heart about fears I felt for my own son in the wake of the deaths of young black boys and men . I felt the ache when I needed someone to grieve with me over faulty moral compasses that seem to value political parties and ideologies over people . I sensed the loneliness when I needed someone to listen , understand and validatenot negotiatemy feelings . <p> I did n't  need someone to assuage my grief ; I just needed a friend to cry with meto enter into my emotional space until my feelings became hers . When someone sits with me in that space , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often told to turn to Christ and remember the gospel , yet asking one another to help bear our burdens is turning to Christ . Its using his appointed means to comfort and encourage his people . Are we not to fulfill the law of Christ by bearing one anothers burdens ( Gal 6:2 ) ? <p> For too long , empathy has been locked away in the darkest caverns of apathy that can spawn pride , self-righteousness , impatience , disunity and even hate . But exercising empathy allows us to enter into the emotional center of another , to feel what they feel , to see what they see , to own with them their fear , hurt , anger , joy and love .

@@100509211 @4709211/ <p> A great deal of confusion exists over whether Christian educators can openly acknowledge their personal faith in the public education system . That 's because our nations courts have often rendered opinions on teachers rights that vary from case to case , rather than creating a clear-cut standard . <p> Generally speaking , students in public schools enjoy powerful protections for their religious-freedom and free-speech rights . Adults , on the other hand , are much more limited since they are government employees . AsAlliance Defending Freedom puts it , public school teachers " are both individual citizens and agents of the state . " So the manner in which First Amendment protections apply to them is " somewhat unique . " <p> Below , I 've provided a Q&amp;A with general tips for teachers . <p> Can teachers respond when a student directly asks them about their faith or spiritual beliefs ? <p> In general , teachers can respond when a student directly asks them a question about their personal beliefs . But teachers can get into sticky situations if they use the questions to begin giving what amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why its best to keep the answer focused on the exact question the student asked . <p> Teachers can also run into claimsespecially when very young students are involvedthat it was n't clear whether they were explaining their personal beliefs or those of the school . So its also a good idea for teachers to preempt their answers with a clear statement that they are expressing their personal perspectives . <p> Can teachers pray or do Bible studies with other teachers ? <p> Teachers can engage in religious-freedom activities with other adult educators before and after school . This can include after-school Bible study and prayer groups for teachers or the distribution of invitations to religious-themed community events among educators ( if the school already allows teachers to distribute flyers to one another about community related activities ) . The U.S. Department of Education itself issued amemorandum acknowledging this , which stated that , " Before school or during lunch , for example , teachers may meet with other teachers for prayer or Bible study to the same extent that they may engage in other conversation or nonreligious activities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible in their classrooms ? <p> Yes , teachers can provide classroom instruction about Christianity and the Bible in a way that meets state academic standards and related curriculum requirements , especially when doing lessons about history , culture or literature . But keep in mind that teachers must address these topics in an objective and purely educational manneri.e. , it must be academic , not devotional . <p> Did you know that some state academic standards actually encourage instruction about Christianity ? For example , California sixth graders are expected to note " the origins of Christianity in the Jewish Messianic prophecies , the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . . . and the contribution of St. Paul the Apostle to the definition and spread of Christian beliefs . " In Massachusetts , seventh grade students are expected to describe " the origins of Christianity and its central features . " Gateways to Better Education has moreexcellent resources on references to Christianity or religion in state academic standards . <p> The U.S. Supreme Court has also affirmed that the " Bible may constitutionally be used in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like " ( Stone v. Graham , 1980 ) . And even in its infamous ruling against adult-led Bible reading in public schools ( Abington v. Schempp , 1963 ) , the Supreme Court acknowledged " that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities . Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion , when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education , may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment . " <p> Can teachers put their personal Bibles on their desks ? <p> This is one of those questions that can be answered in two wayswhether teachers should have that right or whether consistent court rulings have granted them that right . Personally , I believe teachers should have the right to put their personal Bible on their desk , just as they would a personal photograph . The Alliance Defending Freedom hasstated that " there 's no legitimate basis for public schools to prohibit employees from having Bibles at their desks for their own personal use . " <p> Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in court , the answer seems to differ according to the facts in each individual case . To give a few examples : <p> According to both afederal district and appeals court , mandatory prayers occurring in an Arkansas school district crossed the line into a constitutional violationwhile a Bible sitting on the superintendents desk did not . The " Bible and framed scripture verses in the superintendents office . . . were protected by the first amendment 's free speech and free exercise clauses . " <p> Likewise , in 2012 , a Texas district court cited the above case and stated that teachers personal religious items , such as crosses on their desk , did not violate the constitution . " There was no danger of a high school student getting the wrong impression that the District was promoting religion when a teacher displayed a cross next to her other family , vacation , or other personal mementos any more than having a family photo on the teachers desk proves that the District promotes procreation or going skiing . " <p> But more recently , in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination after displaying Christian-themed materials in his classroom , including a Bible on his desk . The case was complicated by the fact that several verbal and printed expressions were at issue , not simply the Bible on his desk . While the Ohio Supreme Court judges upheld the termination , they alsopointed out that the school districts " order for the teacher to remove his personal Bible from his desk was neither reasonable nor valid ; the order infringed on . . . free-exercise rights without justification . " But another judge ( who wrote a concurring opinion in the case ) thought that the school did have the right to require the teacher to keep his Bible out of sight in a drawer . <p> So what does all this mean for teachers ? When it comes to deciding whether or not to display a Bible on a desk , its prudent for teachers to follow the school administrations policy . If a teacher is feeling compelled to test the waters in a gray area that may go beyond that policy , its absolutely crucial to seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher wants to support students who are engaging in religious-freedom activities or event ? <p> Perhaps the best way teachers can be supportive is to recognize and allow students free-speech and religious freedom activities . A " fast facts " sheet explaining students rights is available in the " Know Your Rights " section of BringYourBible.org . A teacher can also show support by volunteering to serve as a faculty sponsor for student-led Christian clubs . ( Many schools require student clubs to have a sponsor . ) But when it comes to promotional efforts like putting up posters or making announcements , all of those efforts should be initiated and led by students . Likewise , its up to students to initiate the creation of the Christian club and then organize and lead the activities . <p> I want to encourage Christian educators in public schools : You are likely having far more of an impact than you realize , as demonstrated by multiple Focus on the Family listeners who shared their stories on our broadcast ( seetranscript ) .

@@100509215 @4709215/ <p> As I have written elsewhere , it is generally bad for government to attempt to regulate religious exercise , but with the advent of the sexual revolution , many progressive lawmakers and bureaucrats can not resist the temptation to use the force of law to wield their agenda . In this case , the provoking incident was the Iowa Civil Rights Commissions clumsy attempt to compel churches to submit to its guidance on sexual orientation and gender identity . <p> The background <p> Back in 2007 , the Iowa Civil Rights Act was expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classesprotecting individuals against discrimination based on these categories . In 2012 , the Iowa Civil Rights Commission published a brochure , " SEXUAL ORIENTATION &amp; GENDER IDENTITY : A Public Accommodations Providers Guide to Iowa Law " which suggested churches could be compelled , under certain circumstances , to censor specific " statements on biblical sexuality . " Even further , churches may also be forced " to open their intimate facilities like changing rooms , showers , and rest rooms to people who identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brochure as published in 2012 : <p> DOES THIS LAW APPLY TO CHURCHES ? <p> Sometimes . Iowa law provides that these protections do not apply to religious institutions with respect to any religion-based qualifications when such qualifications are related to a bona fide religious purpose . Where qualifications are not related to a bona fide religious purpose , churches are still subject to the laws provisions . ( e.g. a child care facility operated at a church or a church service open to the public ) . <p> This is deeply troubling . On what basis might a judgeor worse , an unelected committee of bureaucratsmake such a determination ? Exactly how much " religion " is necessary for a church activity to constitute a " bona fide religious purpose " ? If there is any merit to the so-called " separation of church and state , " it is precisely in this vein . These are questions government was never intended to answer . Indeed , it can not . <p> Yet even with this egregious overreach , the matter was mostly dormant for several years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these issues were simply not receiving much attention . But in its wake , conflicts surrounding religious freedom and these antidiscrimination measures have amassed near-constant attention ( perhaps most prominently displayed in the attack on religious freedom by the Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights ) . And this raised concern about the guidance issued by the Iowa commission . <p> Places of worship ( e.g. churches , synagogues , mosques , etc. ) are generally exempt from the Iowa laws prohibition of discrimination , unless the place of worship engages in non-religious activities which are open to the public . For example , the law may apply to an independent day care or polling place located on the premises of the place of worship . <p> The revision certainly represents the commissions effort to clarify its intent . Clearly the commission recognizes the First Amendment protections that would naturally exempt churches from various aspects of the expanded Iowa Civil Rights Actwhen they act in an explicitly religious capacity . This is hardly sufficient . <p> Churches should be free to communicate their religious beliefs and operate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . The Iowa Civil Rights Commission had no constitutional basis for including explicit threats against houses of worship in any of its materials . While the commission was right to remove some of the most disturbing language in its brochure , the change in the brochure does n't  fix the inherent problem . . . <p> This represents a tremendous win for religious freedom . The ruling only further affirms that churches and houses of worship are protected from " government censorship and control . " And as a result , churches will continue to operate according to their beliefs without fear of government sanction or reprisalthe importance of which can hardly be overstated . <p> Certain members of the commission , citing ambiguity in the original brochure , maintain that the guidance was never intended to target the constitutional freedoms of Iowa churches . But according to the judges ruling , the commissions interpretation of the guidance left this very much in question : <p> At the hearing before the Court , both the State Defendants and the City stated that Plaintiffs restroom policy is likely permitted under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve a religious purpose and that all of the activities Plaintiff enumerated within its Complaint also appeared to be religious in nature .

But we must be vigilant . The culture is changing rapidly . Religious liberty is truly under threat .

@@100509216 @4709216/ <h> 4 everyday graces for an imperfect marriage <p> When God pointed out , " It is not good for the man to be alone " ( Gen. 2:18 CSB ) , he was moved to do something good for the man , and ultimately , for the woman . He made them both for each other , showing that the love relationship of a man and woman in marriage is a good gift from God , a demonstration of grace . <p> Grace did not stop , however , at the union of this first couple . They soon sinned against God and each other . While these lovers were quick to shame and to blame , God was again moved to show grace . They hid , but he found them to correct them , for sure , but also to cleanse and to heal them . Knowing their fig leaves could never camouflage their guilt , God tailored new clothes from the skins of an animal to show them just how far grace goes . <p> In our romanticized culture , gifts are often rightly connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not necessarily in a way that comes natural to us . We often give gifts to express our love . That 's good , but grace does more than show love . Grace makes love possible . So , here are four everyday graces that create an enduring love , even in the most imperfect marriage : <p> 1 . The grace to fail <p> No one likes failure , but every relationship is full of it . The " better or worse " of wedding vows is not an abstract idea , but a practical reality . There are seasons of better , and there are seasons of worse . Sometimes the worse is gross sin or betrayal , and sometimes its less dramatic than that . Whether the dip is big or small , it always begins with subtle neglect that we allow to grow into something more than it should . <p> That 's how it went for Adam and Eve . Apparently , Adam simply neglected to adequately pass on Gods command to his wife . Eve showed an interest in the fruit of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then present but silent when she fell to the temptation . The explanation of their failure is amazingly run-of-the-mill , but the consequences were no less devastating . <p> The " worse " was so unnecessary , yet every married couple has been there . He knew better , but he did it anyway . She was warned , but did n't  listen . We have a right to be angry . We have a right to condemn . We have a right to leave , but we do n't  have to do any of that because the " worse " is where grace shows up the best . <p> We do not sin so grace may increase ( Rom. 6:1 ) , but the failure of our spouse gives grace the chance to shine . The consequences of sin are a good tutor , but the demonstration of grace transforms the relationship and makes space for the lasting love God designed us to experience . <p> 2 . The grace to change <p> The dust cleared . God removed Adam and Eve from the garden , and then Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Eve . " Their living arrangements had been downgraded , their circumstances had changed , and they were different than before , but they found the grace to let their love grow outside of the garden . <p> We are not the same people we were when we said , " I do . " Our spouses have changed too . Our successes shape us , and our difficulties wound us . Experiences reveal our character in a way that was previously unknown and unseen . In time , we discover the ugly realities of sin in each other . Despite declarations of love , we do not always love well , choose well or forgive well . <p> We should never overlook or make excuses for sin , but sin is no match for grace . Sin may occasionally win the day , but grace means the scars of sin that disfigure us do not have to destroy our love for one another . <p> Instead , while success and suffering change us , by grace , they also sanctify us . They make us better , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman I married . I do n't  want to be who I was back then either . We need each other to be more than that , better than that , and that is the work of grace . <p> 3 . The grace to try <p> Adam and Eve began their relationship in paradise . When Adam first saw Eve , he immediately said , " This one , at last , is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh " ( Gen. 2:23 ) . They were " naked , yet felt no shame " ( Gen. 2:24 ) . Life was really good , and then it was n't . <p> Sin separated them from God and from one another , yet God pursued them , forgave them and restored them . He was generous with them . But then they did this : they received his grace . Rather than wallowing in the past or holding each other hostage to previous failures , they tried again . There were only two guarantees : ( 1 ) life would be harder than ever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the garden , Adam and Eve gave their love another go . After devastating failure , they restarted their life together . <p> In a healthy marriage with two flawed people , we discover grace , not grit , makes trying again possible . Its a humbling thing really . Can you imagine Adams sense of regret and inadequacy after losing so much ? How tempting would it have been for him to push the reset button and just try harder to attempt to reestablish his manhood ? Grace , however , does n't  allow us to try harder . It requires we just try again , and this time by trusting God with empty hands and a yielded heart . <p> 4 . The grace to lose <p> Eve soon gave birth to two sons , Cain and Abel . She knew God had helped her , but we read that as these sons became adults , the Lord accepted Abels sacrifice of worship , but not Cains . " Cain was furious , and he looked despondent " ( Gen. 4:5 ) . The Lord warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Cain refused to listen and ultimately attacked and killed his brother Abel . <p> In a way that is remarkably similar to how he responded when Adam and Eve sinned , the Lord confronted Cain . Its right to assume that God was willing to forgive and restore him , but Cain denied any responsibility for Abel . As a result , the Lord judged him by exiling him as a " restless wanderer on the earth " ( Gen. 4:12 ) . <p> First , Adam and Eve lost their home to sin , and then they lost their only two children , one to death and the other to disobedience . They were powerless to fix any of it . <p> None of us can restore to ourselves what sin takes from us . In marriage , these losses threaten our union . As the devil seeks only to steal , kill and destroy , we are prone to turn on each other and demand a recompense that is impossible for anyone to pay . <p> That was not how Adam and Eve responded . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified therapist , they found grace . No doubt they grieved , but by grace , grief does not have to turn into despair . Instead , grace gives more than sin takes . Adam and Eve were intimate again , and Eve gave birth to Seth . In Hebrew , Seths name sounds very similar to the word for " appointed . " Adam and Eve knew Seth was a sovereign act of generosity toward them . <p> When we are engulfed by irreparable loss , Gods grace secures us and binds us together . We may lose and lose greatly , but grace means God never loses us . <p> Feelings of love come and go throughout the seasons of marriage . Circumstances challenge our resolve and loyalty , but Gods amazing grace sustains us in marriage as a gospel witness and beautiful picture of his enduring love for us. 43169 @qwx903169 43181 @qwx903181 43187 @qwx903187 43178 @qwx903178

They changed him in profound ways , leaving lasting scars , both inside and out . <p> Believers who walk with a limp <p> There are many people whom we sit next to in church on Sunday mornings who live with their own stories of brokenness . Their life has been darkened by trauma , violence , deep sins ( theirs as well as others ) and shattering shame . These experiences have had a rippling effect on their life , leaving lasting memories and wounds , the kind that ache and throb their entire lives . <p> Though they have embraced the gospel , their past still haunts them .

They are told they must run toward God with all of their strength , yet often find themselves barely able to lie on the ground facing the right direction . They cling to God desperately , but without ever feeling an assurance of his presence or an ability to rest in the love that surrounds them . " <p> Here are a few truths to remember the next time you find yourself helping a fellow believer who walks with a chronic limp : <p> 1 . Remember where faith comes from . Our faith does not originate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And whether we have a weak faith or strong faith is not up to us either . God is the author of faith that God has assigned " ( Rom. 12:3 ) . In fact , it is not the strength of our faith which saves us , but the object of our faith , Jesus Christ . <p> 2 . God is the author of our stories . When it comes to the circumstances of our lives , God is the author of that as well . In Gods perfect wisdom and righteous plan , he has assigned some to live the life of the walking wounded . To others , he has granted stories free of severe sorrow and shame . Some of us are born into poverty and others into well- to-do families . Some of us have experienced and witnessed horrors that others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from another but the journey we take in our sanctification will also look different from one person to the next . May we not look at others and compare , but look to God who governs and guides us all in our race of faith . <p> 3 . Do n't  add to their pain . If you are tasked with ministering to those who walk with a limp , do n't  add to their struggles . Do n't  weigh them down with additional expectations and demands . Do n't  compare them to others . Do n't  treat them like second class Christians . If you realize that you have been impatient with someone who limps along in their faith , repent and pray for a heart that is patient and forbearing . <p> 4 . Instead , bear their burdens . Paul tells us to bear each others burdens ( Gal . 6:2 ) and encourage and build each other up ( 1 Thess. 5:11 ) . We are to be patient and forbearing with one another , " with all humility and gentleness , with patience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> 5 . Do n't  give up on them . God has promised that he will complete what he started in us ( Phil . 1:6 ) . He will finish the work of sanctification in each of his beloved . Let us not give up on our brothers and sisters in Christ . Let us tell them over and over the good news of who they are in Christ . Let us remind them of the finished and completed work of Christ on their behalf . Let us continue to sing of his amazing grace , no matter how many times it takes . Let us pick them up every time they fall . And let us love them , just as Christ has loved us . <p> Helping those whose lives are marred with scars and who wobble forward with weak legs in their Christian journey is part of what it means to be in community in the Body of Christ .

@@100509229 @4709229/ <h> 5 ways to pursue peace in a difficult relationship <p> My friends are good forgivers . In fact , my best friends are women who are hard to offend and quick to forgive . Their love for me has caused them to overlook a multitude of offenses and to continue to think the best of me despite my track record . Relationships are not for the faint of heart . But they are worth it . When God created relationships , he let us in on breathtakingly beautiful mysteries about himself . As we live in relationship with one another , he takes us into a deeper experience of His love . <p> here 's the rub : we have to be willing to navigate hurt , misunderstanding and differences with each other . This can be especially true during the holidays . And while I 'm still in kindergarten when it comes to these issues , here are a few helpful things I tell myself when I 'm in the thick of a difficult relationship : <p> I 'm one to talk : I 'm naturally sensitive and have a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm working hard against this tendency because I want to love people , not react to them . Sometimes its as simple as growing thicker skin in order to love someone past their rough edges . ( So let your friends say something stupid once in awhile . Its good for you . ) <p> 2 . Give it time . <p> As I look back at some of my most intimidating conflicts with family and friends , I realize that time has often played a significant role in resolving our differences and helping us better understand each other . To be honest , I hate that . I want restoration right now . I 'm a peacemaker at heart , and I 'm miserable when a relationship is n't in a place of perfect tranquility . But some of the most tender restorations have come years after what felt like an insurmountable difference . God was working in both of our hearts , humbling and maturing us , and that kind of work typically does n't  happen overnight . The writer of Ecclesiastes says , <p> " For everything there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing <p> a time to seek , and a time to lose <p> a time to keep silence , and a time to speak . " <p> God can give us the wisdom to know when to pursue immediate restoration ( embrace , seek , speak ) and when to step back and wait on him ( refrain , lose , keep silent ) . <p> 3 . Give fresh grace . <p> That friend or family member you 're at odds with ? You have a fresh and abundant supply of grace to offer them today . Gods mercies are new every morningfor you , for them . Its easy to start viewing someone through their history of offense , but as L.M. Montgomery once wrote , " Isnt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet ? " <p> When I 'm struggling to offer this kind of grace to an offender , chances are I 've forgotten how much Ive been forgiven . Think of it this way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books in the New York Public Library , your offenses against me would fit on a small Post-It Note . When I revel in the fact that my library of sin was burned upIm motivated to go set fire to that measly little Post-It Note . <p> 4 . Cultivate a loving thought life . <p> Do you have conversations in your head with " that person " ? You know , those monologues where you say all the zingers you 've wanted to say but have n't ? <p> The fruit of relationship begins in the soil of our thoughts . So if our inner lawyer is rising up in our defense , if were constantly replaying anothers faults and failings , if were mentally preparing for the next offense , then that relationship will bear defensive , fault-finding fruit . <p> On the other hand , if were applying Gods truth to a difficult relationshipif were resolved to love past our differences by Gods powerthen no matter what choices the other person makes , we will reap the fruit of a free and forgiving spirit . Well no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Stop acting surprised . <p> There should be a disclaimer at the outset of every new relationship , be it friend , roommate , spouse or in-law : " At some point along the way , I will miserably fail you , hurt you and anger you . Guaranteed . " So , we should stop acting so surprised when it happens . <p> Yes , we have the best of intentions to love each other , but the truth is , were two sinners in relationship , and things are going to get messy from time to time . Do n't  make the mistake of putting your friend or family member in the place of God . It leads to unrealistic expectations and unnecessary hurt . God is perfect . They are not . <p> If were going to enjoy authentic , life-giving , loving relationships , we need to be ready to forgive ( and be forgiven ) . Seventy times seven . <p> Easier said than done , is n't it ? Were going to fail often at forgiving and lovingbut he wo n't .

@@100509230 @4709230/ <h> 4 suggestions for becoming slow to anger as a parent <p> I wrote about being a parent who is slow to get angry with their children on my blog , and a mother asked me that essential question : How ? <p> Her question is one that many of us have asked . We see the beauty of grace contrasted with the ugliness that still lingers within us , and we find our hearts asking the same question . I can only attempt to answer as someone who knows much failure amid much grace . What follows are not theoretical or from the past , but they are intensely fresh , personal , present and real . <p> Before we can change what we do as parents , we often need to change how we think . Identifying thought patterns might seem purely theoretical and not of much practical help , but if what we do is often the overflow of how we think , perhaps its a good place to begin . <p> Four helpful realizations <p> 1 . Realize that the times when we are easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> Often , the moments when we are naturally angered are those times when we can teach our children about life , sin and grace . Conflict is a part of life in a sin-filled , broken world . For our childrens entire lives , they 're going to be dealing with it . <p> In those moments when were easily angered , our instinct tends to want to get things back to a state of peace and quiet as speedily and effortlessly as possible . The children are whining or fighting so we angrily snarl , " Enough . Stop it right now ! I do n't  want to hear it ! " What a wasted opportunity . When its possible , we ought to be willing to take the time to patiently talk , listen and teach . In our haste to get back to peace , we sometimes forget the most important part : their hearts . <p> 2 . Realize that angry parenting is often deeply selfish . <p> Think of the words that usually escape our lips in our worst parenting moments : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it up to here ! " What 's striking about these phrases is that they 're all about me . Theyre selfish phrases that give us a glimpse of our heartour anger is about us and how their behavior is disrupting our life . <p> But parenting is n't about us being sick of whining or fighting , is it ? Ultimately , its not about us at all . Its about our children and putting ourselves aside to love , nurture , teach and guide them . A quickly angered parent is a selfish parent whose peace and quiet is being disrupted . It can be helpful to realize afresh the intrinsically selfish quality of the easily angered parent and to remember that grace-filled parenting means caring more about others than ourselves . <p> 3 . Realize that being easily angered is less about lack of control and more about lack of desire . <p> When our kids do stuff in public that makes us mad , we often handle it differently than if we were at home by ourselves . Were more patient , are n't  we ? Kinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . We really do have self control in moments of frustration . We really do have the capacity to respond the way we should . When I 'm at home , unnoticed by others , its not that I lack the control to do what 's right . Its that I lack the desire . <p> There 's a sadness in this because most of us truly care more about what our children think of us than a bunch of strangers . More than that , we care more about what God thinks about us . Yet , our actions often indicate otherwise . It can be helpful to remember that how we respond really is a choice , and the people who matter most see our parenting all the time . <p> 4 . Realize that becoming a slow-to-anger parent is often about reprogramming the muscle memory of the heart . <p> Much of our time in parenthood is spent reacting to things our children do . We all have patterns of reaction in our lives . When we reflect upon how we habitually react in moments of frustration , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who are quickly angered , the muscle memory of the heart is to react in anger instead of grace . When we find ourselves habitually reacting in anger , it means we need to repent and form new heart habits . Eventually , with time and much grace , we create a new rhythm that changes the muscle memory of our heart . <p> Four practical suggestions <p> 1 . Prepare in advance . <p> Before the day begins to unfold and begins to unravel , anticipate that your children will occasionally do frustrating things that annoy you and get under your skin , and then prepare to react with grace . Think about it , know its coming and then plan how you 'll respond . <p> Each day , our children are going to do many things that bring us joy and make us laugh . And with just as much certainty , our kids are going to do things that irritate and anger us . Why does it seem to catch us unprepared so that all were doing is reacting ? Before the moments come , spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to go through parenthood reacting . We want to be proactively changing . <p> 2 . Reflect at the end of the day . <p> When its been a good , joy-filled day with your children , take a few moments to reflect on why things went well and why you reacted in grace instead of anger . And similarly , when its been a difficult day and you 've been angry and sinful , take a few minutes to reflect upon why it was a rough day . You might be surprised at the clarity of patterns and themes that emerge with this little exercise . One mark of mature , sanctified Christians is that they are often people who can identify those things which cause them to stumble and those things which help them soar . <p> 3 . Get enough sleep . <p> This does n't  apply to everyone , but for many it holds true that lack of sleep leads to lack of grace . When were tired , were irritable . And when were irritable , we are prone to becoming quickly angered instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons where sufficient rest is impossible . But in the many other times when staying up too late is a choice , we ought to remember that its the people who matter to us most who will be on the receiving end of our tired , angry responses . <p> 4 . Avoid rushing . <p> When were rushing somewhere with our children , running late or havent allotted enough time , it can easily lead to frustrated , angry and impatient words . It does n't  take being a parent for long to realize that , with young children , the simplest things can take way longer than we ever thought possible . Its just the way it is . <p> A simple but helpful detail in how my heart and our family functions has been to become more organized and , along with this , to ensure that we have ample time to do whatever it is we need to do . Of course , this is n't always possible , and there are many disclaimers , but when its within our power to do so , avoiding rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why we have tremendous hope <p> Parenting is a journey . There are days when it seems like Gods grace pours into and out of us into our children . There 's good stuff happening in our home , and were filled with hope and excitement for the days ahead . Then there are days where it seems like anger and tears have been the theme . <p> But even during hard times , we have every reason to have tremendous hope . We 're not alone . Truly , in our failures and in our joys alike , we 're not doing this parenting thing alone . We live our lives beneath the shadow of his wings , and even as we parent our little ones , were being parented by a Father who loves us , is with us , and is helping us every step along the way . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

Their life is messier than you could have imagined and you feel dissapointed , angry , confused , disillusioned , sad ... <p> How are we supposed to feel when other Christians miss Gods mark ? How can we cope with the chaos other peoples sin creates ? What should we say ( if anything ? ) <p> Here are nine things to keep in mind when another Christian disappoints you . <p> 1 . All have sinned <p> Romans 3:23 is a gut punch we all need from time to time . " For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God . " <p> All have sinned . As in every single one of us . <p> The fact that every person on earth is a sinner in desperate need of a Savior never stops being a shock to our systems , but it is a constant reminder of how desperately we need grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ephesians 5:11-14 says , " Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness , but instead expose them . For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret . But when anything is exposed by the light , it becomes visible , for anything that becomes visible is light . Therefore it says , <p> Awake , O sleeper , <p> and arise from the dead , <p> and Christ will shine on you. " <p> Although painful , it is a gift when sin is dragged into the light . Jesus is the light of the world ( John 8:12 ) . He calls us to live like bright cities on a hill ( Matt. 5:14 ) . We have no business keeping parts of our life in the dark . When God exposes dark parts of a persons life or heart , it is an act of mercy and an opportunity for us to thank Him for His extravagant grace . <p> 3 . The cross was built for heavy loads <p> " He himself bore our sins in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin and live to righteousness . By his wounds you have been healed " ( 1 Pet . 2:24 ) . <p> From time to time , we need a reminder of what makes us Christians . It is n't that we have perfect lives . It is n't that we listen to the right Christian music or say no to certain books or movies . We are Christians because we have put our faith in Jesus and his redemptive work on the cross . The violence of the cross is necessary because of our sin . Jesus did not have to hang on the cross any longer for your disgraced pastor than he did for you . The cross is big enough to carry any sin , " big " or " small . " There 's no sin we can throw at it that the cross is not big enough to handle . <p> 4 . Speak the truth ( in the head , into Christ " ( Eph. 4:14-15 ) . <p> Gods intention is not that we live our lives in a constant tug of war . We are to protect and guide each other by speaking the truth in love . <p> I once heard someone say , " Whatever speak the truth in love means , it means to speak the truth . " What is the truth , exactly ? <p> John 17:17 says , " Sanctify them in the truth ; your word is truth . " <p> We need to remind each other what Gods Word says often . That 's not the same as blasting someone on your Facebook wall or on Twitter . Which brings me to #5 . <p> show perfect courtesy toward all people .

" <p> Responding to other peoples sin with disgust or feelings of self-righteousness is like worrying about a little sawdust in a friends eye while a 2x4 sticks out of our own . Our sin has a way of blinding us to the ways we are missing the mark and making us hypersensitive to how others fall short . <p> While the Bible does teach us to lovingly remind other Christians about how God calls us to live , that 's not our first mission . We must be most concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of sin in the life of someone else , take the opportunity to assess your own life . Repeat the prayer of King David and ask the Lord to root out all sin in your heart . <p> " Search me , O God , and know my heart ! Try me and know my thoughts ! And see if there be any grievous way in me , and lead me in the way everlasting ! " ( Ps. 139 : 23-24 ) . <p> 7 . Forgive , for real <p> In the wake of the horrific Charleston shooting , USA Today published an article that said this . <p> " When Christians are in the news , it 's usually because they have done something wrong they 've gotten on the wrong side of a culture war or cheated on their wife , or worse . What the world rarely gets to see is the powerful grace that flows from a deep faith predicated on the belief that we are all sinners in need of forgiveness .

' If he kissed me on the cheek , I would kiss him back . " <p> These are graphic pictures of forgiveness . Forgiveness often feels so gut wrenching that we want to run in the opposite direction . But the Bible reminds us that we can extend forgiveness because we have been forgiven of so much . <p> The article quoted above is proof that the world is watching . Yes , they watch when we fall short , but they also watch when we respond to sin like God has called end of the earth " ( Acts 1:8 ) . <p> We are the billboard God wants to use to tell the world about Him .

It really is that simple . <p> The silver lining <p> As Christians , we will continue to disappoint each other . We will sin in public and in private . We will mess up our lives and hurt each other . We will all fall short of the standard of holiness God has set for us . That 's the cloud , but there is a silver lining . <p> Jesus died died for us " ( Rom. 5:8 ) . <p> All sin reminds us of our great need and his great sacrifice .

We should be genuinely curious about the perspective of someone from the other side of the table . <p> If you do n't  know anyone from the other side of the table , follow blogs and podcasts and twitter feeds . As you do , compassion ( sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others ) will grow and undeniably lead you to empathy ( the capacity to place oneself in anothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked " hospitality " as my focus word this year . I thought I would learn a few things about cooking , maybe buy a bigger table and set aside some extra time and money to share meals with others . Then I started studying . <p> In the New Testament , the word hospitality actually means " love of strangers " ; the same kind of love that you would love your family with . This is where things get interesting . Martha Stewart suddenly has less bearing on the conversation , and it gets a little more uncomfortable . This tells me that I am not off the hook after I invite my friends and family over for a meal . It also tells me that its not an event to be checked off the list . Instead , its a lifestyle of sacrificial love . <p> This love of strangers or outsiders ( typically categorized as immigrants , widows , orphans and the poor ) is a common thread woven throughout the Old and New Testament ( Isa. 58 ; Rom. 13 ) . What is God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing us that he is a God who goes outside the gate for people who have nothing to give . He is a God that must go through Samaria . He is a God that invites enemies into his family and has the audacity to adopt them as sons and daughters through his Son . <p> Ill never forget a hands-on representation of this I experienced . I was with my friends who are missionaries to refugees in Chicago , and we walked into a home where an impossibly small and aged grandmother was sitting in the cornerobviously blind , mostly deaf and very frail . And sadly , she was completely unnoticed by me . But this was not the case with my friends . They walked directly to her and sat with her , sang to her and prayed with her as our hosts patiently waited . One of my friends turned to me and said something to this effectand I hope to never forget it " Liza , always go to the smallest person in the room . Its what Jesus would want . " <p> Hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a direct reflection of the gospel . I do n't  believe its just for a few believers with a calling ; I truly believe its for everyone who follows Jesus . We are supposed to be taking care of the vulnerablethose that do n't  have natural , societal provisions for thriving . Furthermore , we are to be intentional about putting the hand of the stranger into the hand of the Savior . <p> This preaches so " amen-y , " but its so hard to live . If you are going to adjust your actual lifestyle and go out of your way to be hospitable , it will end up turning some , if not all , of your life upside down . You will invite misunderstanding on both sides . You will be interrupted , taken advantage of , made uncomfortable . These kinds of relationships are messy and refuse to serve our ideals for efficiency . <p> 3 . Stay until you empathize . Another thing , and maybe the hardest thing , is to embrace an empathy for our neighborsthe kind that only comes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden . And then , before you know it , you cant turn your head , change the channel or be OK again until your neighbor is OK , too . A quote from a black brother drives this home : " I need people who do n't  feel my pain to believe me when I say it hurts . " Its possible to start to believe your neighbor , in the marrow of your bones , even though you do n't  directly feel what he is feeling . <p> This is obviously painful , but is n't it a better than apathy , ignorance or crossed arms ? If the brokenness of the world has n't  affected you , may I softly and tenderly suggest that , as a follower of Jesus , it probably should . <p> 4 . Start where you are . Most of us will not move to a refugee camp or live in an urban setting or open an orphanage in Thailand ( but do n't  rule those options out ! ) , But you can start closer to home . <p> Another story from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend on a business trip in Dallas . The pizza delivery youth in the lobby of the hotel did n't  seem to care much that his pants were around his knees , but he did care , deeply and loudly , that his pepsi was stuck in the vending machine . It was so easy to move past and be annoyed . But it was n't for my friend . She moved toward him , expressed sympathy and said , " Wait . Do you like RedBull ? Yes ? OK , stay right here . " She ran to her room , grabbed a 4-pack of RedBull , handed it to him and warmly wished him a good day . The pizza delivery guy was her neighbor for that moment . <p> We can do this , too . We can stop for the people that no one else stops for . We can be free to love them with arms wide open . We can go out of our way to be in their lane at the grocery store . We can intentionally get to know our immigrant neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that homeless man that we drive by every day and get to know them . We can sit next to the mentally handicapped person at our next party . <p> That 's my dream and constant prayer ; that we , as the church , would be compassionate and courageous ; that we would be sad , but not afraid ; that we would spend more time asking who our neighbor is and less time ensuring our own comfort . I 'm praying we lay down our rights and opinions , and instead , take up the incredible blessing of this burden . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509234 @4709234/ <h> 4 ways you should respond to suicide <p> I can remember driving down the highway in Virginia in a state of depression . I 've slipped into depression probably a milder form than many have experienced two or three times in my life . One was during my first pastorate , back in the late 80s . Every Saturday I 'd get a copy of the Richmond newspaper and peruse the help wanted ads to see if there was a way for me to provide for my family if I threw in the towel on ministry . Honestly , if I 'd had a fall-back option then I 'd probably not be in the ministry today . As I drove down the rural highway in Southside Virginia my mind was walking through the valley of deep darkness that David spoke of in Psalm 23 . <p> I looked at trees in the median and thought I could just swerve the wheel into one of those and the pain would stop . <p> I never seriously considered turning the wheel , but I had a deep longing for death that was evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lie , a lie I was believing , one that insulted the God of heaven and gave glee to the accuser of the brethren . My life was not hopeless , not as long as God was there with me . My feelings deceived me . The situations that I felt were beyond repair have all worked out some took a short time , some long , but God resolved them . God worked to restore my heart , my joy and my passion for Christ . It is always too early to despair when the Living God of heaven is your Father . By believing the enemys lie , I teetered on the edge of spiritual self-destruction . I thank God that he led me through the valley of deepest darkness and back to his light ! <p> I 've had too many friends and family fall over the precipice and leave the earth by their own hands . My wifes brother took his own life 30 years ago and the family still grieves today . The toughest funeral I ever did was for one of my deacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took this path out of his problems . Just recently , a fellow Iowa pastor ended his own life , leaving a grieving family , a devastated church and a stunned and sorrowful convention . There have been many others through the years . Of course , the Southern Baptist family was rocked yesterday with another such tragedy . <p> Suicide is the most devastating form of death because of the scars it leaves in the souls of those who are left behind . Could I have done something ? Why did I say what I said ? Is this my fault ? We are left wondering what was going on , obsessing on why this person we loved felt that this was their best option , engaging in self-recrimination and examination of every word , deed and conversation , and feeling guilty not just a little guilt , but massive , soul-stealing , gut-wrenching , keep-you-up-at-night guilt ! Suicide may be an act of physical violence committed against oneself , but it is the most horrendous act of spiritual violence imaginable against family and friends . It leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the worst part of it is that there is little that anyone but the Savior can do to salve these wounds . We can be there to hold up the family . We can express our grief . We can offer what help we can give . But the wounds of suicide are such that we can do little except express unending , indefatigable love and support for the next decade or two ! <p> A family touched by suicide will never be the same . In 1979 I was in a skiing accident in Eldora , Colo. , that left me with permanent injuries . I recovered and have completed marathons , played softball , basketball , soccer and a host of other sports . But the limitations and effects of that injury are always there . If I move or sit a certain way , I can get shudders of pain throughout my body . Its been 35 years and I 've lived my life , but the accident on the ski slope left injuries that never fully heal . That is what it is like for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , they learn to go on with life , to walk and even run . But the pain is always there . Certain triggers will bring a stab of pain regardless of how many years go by . Sweet memories now soured by grief , shame and pain . A sudden burst of guilt and self-condemnation . Questions without answers . The limp of a battered soul . <p> The victims of suicide ( family , friends , etc ) will carry those scars as long as they live . <p> So , what can we do ? What can we as Christians , as the church of Jesus Christ , do to help our grieving brothers and sisters , to alleviate their pain ? I would make several suggestions . In general , I think the advice given in Todd Benkerts excellent post on dealing with cancer victims applies here both the positive and the negative . I would give the following as suggestions for helping people who are going through this kind of tragedy . <p> The promise of prayer is too often trite and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest resource in the moment of grief . I can not heal the hurting but my God can . He is the Great Physician , the Balm of Gilead , the God of all comfort . We can go to him on behalf of a family member or friend and the fervent , faithful prayers of the Body of Christ help . We can pray comfort for the grieving ; pray that Gods presence will surround them and sustain them . <p> 2 ) Be present . <p> If you call someone " Jobs friend " it is not a compliment . The friends of Job tried to make sense of his suffering and did so in a petty , theologically shallow and ineffective way . But what we often forget is that before they were horrible friends they were the best friends ever . They sat in silence with Job on the ash heap for 7 days . They were there . They were present . It was when they opened their mouths that they lost their place as the greatest comforters ever . <p> The greatest gift you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounded life . It is a blessing to sit with a person the day of the death or to be there for the funeral . But in the days and weeks thereafter that is when true friendship is needed . You become Gods physical therapist to help the hurting work through the healing process . Through your love , patience , fellowship and consistent friendship , Gods healing takes place . <p> Be there , not just for the short term , but for the long haul . <p> 3 ) Cierra la Boca . <p> Keep your mouth shut ! Jobs friends blew it by talking . <p> Of course , I 'm not advocating actual silence . I 'm just saying that you neednt say anything witty , insightful , or life-changing in these situations . When you try to communicate something profound , it often comes out as a cliche , or trite , or condescending - it is generally not helpful . <p> Unless you are the mentor or spiritual authority of the grieving person ( and even then , tread lightly ) it is not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was Eliphaz , Bildad and Zophars mistake . They tried to tell Job exactly why this tragedy came upon him ( they were wrong ) and how he could make things right ( again , they missed the mark ) . They did n't  understand Gods sovereign plan and were therefore wholly incapable of explaining it to anyone else . They spoke out of ignorance and made Jobs suffering worse . <p> It is NOT your job to explain the activity , purposes and plans of God in a specific situation . This is not the time for you to test drive your theology on a fragile soul . <p> When I visit a family that has suffered a tragedy , I generally warn them that they need to be prepared for people who want to help to say incredibly foolish things . There are only three things we need to communicate to a person in grief . <p> God loves you and I am praying he will sustain you through this . We do need to hold on to Gods sovereignty and love , but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever explained all the reasons for Gods actions to Job . He was just called to trust God . The solution is TRUST , not understanding everything . We must trust God even in the darkness when we cant see where we are going or why he is leading us on this particular path . When you try to be Gods trail guide you do more harm than good . Point them to trust in God , not in your understanding of Gods workings . <p> I love you . While I do n't  understand all you are going through , I care deeply about you . <p> I will be here for you every step of the way . As long as it takes . <p> Of course , then you have to follow through . Pray and be there . It is your actions , not primarily your words , that will help the suffering . <p> 4 ) Be patient . <p> This is going to be a long ( lifelong ) process . When someone has a sniffle , they snap out of it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a few weeks . But this is going to take years to heal , and even then there will still be the spiritual limp . You just have to be patient and faithful as a friend or as a church . <p> Along the way , do n't  be surprised if you hear or see some things that both you . Grieving people can become so overwhelmed they evidence emotional instability and even bizarre behavior . Unless it is extreme ( you never take a threat of self-harm lightly ) you just weather the storm . People will sometimes even lash out at God . Job did . God can handle it . You do n't  need to be the theology police to correct every little thing they say . Just assure them that God is good and faithful . Encourage them to trust God even if they do not understand his works . <p> When someone you love becomes the victim of suicide , you have a long task in front of you . You can not cure the wound , but you can be an agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , show your constant and faithful love and endure in this grace . <p> NOTE : If you know someone who is considering suicide , do not leave him or her alone .

@@100509235 @4709235/ <h> Learning to lament : 4 lessons from Psalms <p> We all know that feeling : That grip on our heart when we turn on the morning news to hear about a heartbreaking tragedy that has just taken place ; or when we open our email and read about fellow believers losing their life for the sake of Christ ; or when we see our culture dishonor God and his holy Word . <p> In our fallen world , there is much for us to grieve . There are many things we hear and learn about on a daily basis that leave us bewildered , confused , saddened , crushed and even downright terrified . What is a believer to do ? How do we wake up each day to devastating news , to wars and rumors of wars , to heartbreaking stories ? <p> The Psalms of lament <p> Between the time David was anointed by Samuel and when he finally became king of Israel , he spent a long time on the run from King Saul . Saul wanted him dead and was intent to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to place and at times , lived in caves . On once such occasion , while on the run for his life , David penned Psalm 142 , which begins , " With my voice I cry out to the Lord ; with my voice I plead for mercy to the Lord " ( vs. 1 ) . <p> Psalm 142 is a psalm of lament . Different than the psalms of thanksgiving or remembrance , the laments are those psalms where the writer cries out to God . Many of us read the laments and nod our heads because the psalmist gets it . He knows what the real world is like . He does n't  sugar coat things ; he tells it like it is . The words of the laments are ones many believers turn to when they are frightened , hurt or saddened by the pains of this life . <p> But the laments do more than just mirror what 's going on in our hearts . They show us how we can live life in this fallen world . They show us what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They show us how to respond when everything in this world is changing and the unknown future fills us with fear . Thankfully , the laments have a pattern we can follow so that we , too , can cry out to God in our distress . <p> Learning to lament <p> Turn to God . In Psalm 142 , the psalmist cries out to God . For example , he says , " I pour out my complaint before him ; I tell my trouble before him " ( vs. 2 ) . This is the first lesson of the laments . When we are uncertain , afraid , confused or saddened , we need to come before our Father in heaven . As adopted children , redeemed by the blood of Christ , we are free to come into Gods presence with confidence and know that he will hear us . Not only that , but he delights that we come before him . More often than not though , turning to God with our emotions is not the first thing we do . Instead , we usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  exist or seek to find a temporary savior to our problems . But the laments remind us that God is King . He is our Savior , deliverer and refuge . He alone is our salvation . <p> Cry for help . In Psalm 142 , David then cried out to God for help , " Attend to my cry , for I am brought very low ! Deliver me from my persecutors , for they are too strong for me ! " ( vs. 6 ) . This is another element of the lamentsasking God for help . Whether it is help for ourselves , for other brothers and sisters in Christ , for our country or for our world , we need to cry out to God . Like David , we need to seek Gods deliverance and mercy . <p> Speak the truth . The next lesson we can learn from the laments is how the psalmist speaks the truth about who God is . He reminds himself of Gods character and goodness . In verse three , David wrote , " When my spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reminds himself that God knows all things . In verse five , he refers to God as his refuge , " I cry to you , O Lord ; I say , You are my refuge , my portion in the land of the living. " As we cry out to God in sorrow or fear about all that is happening around us , we too need to remember who God is and what he has done . He is good and faithful . We need to remember " The kings heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD ; he turns it wherever he will " ( Prov. 21:1 ) . <p> Trust in the Lord . Lastly , the psalmist voices a response of trust in the Lord , " Bring me out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name ! The righteous will surround me , for you will deal bountifully with me " ( vs. 7 ) . This is the goal of the laments . They move forward from despair to joy , from fear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into Gods presence and cries out to the Lord , he remembers who God is and what he has done , and his joy is rekindled . He knows that God rules and reigns over all things . He knows that Gods redemptive hand is at work . He knows that God is good . And so he responds in praise and trust . He does n't  know when the Lord will deliver him , but he trusts and believes that he will . <p> The pattern of the laments is for us to follow as well . When our hearts are broken over tragedy , evil , and sin in the world , we need to lament . We need to bring our grief , sorrow and fear before the Lord . We need to cry out to him for help . We need to trust his goodness and faithfulness . For he alone is our refuge and salvation . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

If they can remove a single animal from its herd , lunch is easily delivered , even if the animal they are hunting is much larger or faster than the lions themselves . <p> Knowing our place <p> We are much like a lions unsuspecting prey , because we are all made weak and vulnerable by isolation .

" But the serpent said to the woman , You God , knowing good and evil. " <p> I believe Satan was hunting Eve . He waited for a moment when she was not surrounded by her community . Verse six tells us that Adam was nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even if he was n't , Eve apparently did n't  take the time to talk to him about what was happening .

Certainly , she would have been even more protected against this attack if she had talked to her husband and consulted with God . God had given her a double-layered safety net through a relationship with him and a relationship with Adam , but she cut right through the net and put herself in grave danger by deciding to go at it alone . What happened next reminds us that we are all daughters of Eve . <p> Then the eyes of both were opened , and they knew that they were naked . And they sewed fig leaves @ @ @ presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden . ( Gen. 3:7-8 ) <p> Isolation set Eve up to sin .

In this way , loneliness is less of an emotion and more of a military strategy effectively used by our enemy . Our shame then lies to us and tells us that isolation is the only way to regain control . In this way , loneliness and shame become a two-edged sword that is very effective at takings us out at the knees . <p> A church at the stadium <p> Researchers recently surveyed those who regularly attend church services to get a feel for their experiences .

I have to wonder if the people in this group know what connectedness feels like if or theyve settled for a synthetic substitute . <p> What people were saying is that for them church feels like going to a football game . They stadium is packed . They are surrounded by people who all want the same thing . The mood is light , but they are not really connected .

We prefer to think of church as a country club where we wear our best clothes , including a pretty mask , instead of a hospital where we can get bound up and healed through the loving care of others . <p> Are you lonely ?

@@100509239 @4709239/ <h> 10 things for Christians to consider during election season <p> We are nearing the end of an election season . Often , politics can get heated and nasty . So how should followers of Christ conduct themselves in the midst of a campaign ? Here are a few things we might consider : <p> 1 . Remember to be grateful for the election . As Americans , we live in a representative republic , so we have the rare opportunity to shape our government . Partisanship and politics can be wearying and noisy and half-crazy at times , but at least we have the freedom to express ourselves and to vote . Many people around the world live under cruel and repressive regimes and have no say in the kinds of leaders who rule over them . <p> So just when you grow tired of looking at the political signs dotting the landscape , when you 've heard the tenth robo-call of the day , remember those dissidents who sit in jail cells around the world , merely for expressing an opposing thought . Freedom of speech can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than totalitarianism and repression . <p> 2 . Do n't  put your trust in chariots . Be grateful for the opportunity to elect those you feel will best lead our country , but do n't  fall into the trap that everything in history and in your life depends on the next election . Politics is important , but not ultimate . Do n't  be a practical atheist , white-knuckling election night , sweating every ebb and flow of the season , and acting as if you need to build a fortified bunker if " the wrong guy wins . " Advocate and work for your guy , but put your trust in the Lord . God holds history in the palm of his hand and is not at all worried sick about which party controls the levers of power in America . <p> 3 . Ignore most of the political appeals you hear from both sides . To win in modern American politics , you have to paint the other guy as some combination of an axe murder , a village idiot and a helpless puppet . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in an ominous , black-and white ad and convince people that if this guy wins you might as well move to Canada . Both sides will do this . But the truth is somewhere in between . It is a good idea to periodically tune out the election news during election season , toss those pesky mailers , and hang up your phone when you hear the gravel-voiced narrator begin his robo-calls of doom . <p> 4 . Advocate issues , avoid the petty stuff . Its amazing how easily campaigns delve into petty stuff . Vote for a guy because he holds positions closest to yours . Advocate issues of importance and weight . Resist being drug into the gutter and arguing for or against issues that have little or no consequence . <p> 5 . Avoid the " ends-justifies-the-means " of politics . " All is fair in love and war , " we say . This is true ... unless you happen to be a follower of Christ and you 're commanded , repeatedly , to measure your words , to be kind , to love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are to act and talk like a Christian . <p> 6 . Do n't  let your political differences ruin friendships . It is easy to allow political differences to drive a wedge in important friendships . But we must prize our love for our brothers and sisters in the Lord and our friendships with those outside the faith above the strong opinions we hold . That does n't  mean we back down ; it means we find a way to get along with people of varying opinions . Friendships within and without the church are vital for gospel ministry . <p> 7 . Do n't  fall for conspiracy theories . Do n't  forward emails that are less than true or havent been verified by reputable sources . Its easy to want to believe the worst about political adversaries , but God calls us to believe the truth ( 1 Cor. 13 ; Phil . 4:8 ) . Do n't  post questionable stories or theories on Facebook or Twitter . As Christians , we should be about truth . <p> 8 . Do n't  allow politics to convince you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politics likes to divide things up into good guys and bad guys , to see the " other side " as the enemy . If you consume enough partisan media , you will soon develop a mentality that sees only those who agree with you as good people and the rest as enemies . Furthermore , it obscures the real battle . Were told in Scripture that people are not the enemy , Satan is . And our fight is never against mere mortals , but part of a larger , worldwide spiritual conflict ( Eph. 6:2 ) . Plus , if you convince yourself to hate certain groups , how then can you lovingly reach them with the good news of the gospel ? <p> 9 . Avoid the " out there " mentality . The weakness of political engagement is that it lends itself away from self-reflection . The partisan mind constantly thinks all the worst problems in the world are " out there . " The gospel , however , forces us into sober self-reflection . It reminds us that the real problem is inside , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived under the oppression of a wicked and tyrannical government , said , " I am the chief of sinners . " He did n't  point to Nero . Its easy to blame Hollywood , Wall Street , and the media for all of our woes , but if we were honest and allowed the gospel to penetrate our hearts , we 'd realize that we are our own worst enemies . <p> 10 . Look for a better city . Politics is driven by a God-given longing for utopia , a desire for perfection , by the dawning reality that life on this earth is not how it should be . Politicians come along and promise to fix things , to build that utopian dream we all desire . The problem is that politicians are flawedthey are not saviors . We must , like the exiles in Babylon , seek the welfare of our cities and communities and yet understand that our efforts are only a small part of Christs ongoing work of renewal , which will be completed when he fully consummates his Kingdom . In between the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sin-cursed world . So even as we seek the flourishing of our communities , we must keep our eyes on another city , whose " builder and maker is God ( Heb. 11:1 ) . " 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182 
@@100509240 @4709240/ <h> How to understand the three A 's of religious liberty as Christians <p> There are different ways to think about religious liberty : From outside the Christian tradition and within it . In a recent article titled " The three As of religious liberty , " I attempted to explain how ideas that undergird religious liberty are ideas that everyone understands and resonates with : Everyone worships something ( adoration ) ; everyone wants to live truthfully ( authentically ) ; and everyone has an ultimate standard for what they value ( authority ) . These concepts are the building blocks of religious liberty . <p> That article focused on the commonalities that we all share around religious liberty . In this article , I want to show how Christians should use the same categories to think about religious liberty as something distinctly Christian . <p> Adoration : Who or what do we worship ? <p> Adoration means to adore , to worship or venerate , or to give our highest devotion , praise and love to someone or something . Everyone adores . Whether its a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone has something at their core that drives them ; that contends for their attention and affections ; and that helps anchor their lives and give it meaning . <p> Christians confess that the Triune God is the Lord of the universe and that the Godhead is to be worshipped . Here are some verses that explain adoration from a Christian perspective : <p> Ascribe to the LORD the glory due to His name ; worship the LORD in holy array ( Ps. 29:2 ) . <p> Let all the earth fear the LORD ; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him ( Ps. 33:8 ) . <p> For Christians , worship is not just a rote practice . Worship is the source of our existence , because Christians believe we are made to worship our Creator . <p> If someones liberties to find meaning in life should not be restricted , neither should the liberties that ground the ability for someone to find that same meaning in God . When understood rightly , religious liberty is directly connected to Gods glory , because to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty that allows people to respond to God in ways that honor and esteem Him . <p> Authenticity : What is true living ? <p> Religious liberty is about authenticity because having the opportunity to act on what drives someones motivations ensures that someones deepest convictions are n't  restricted and that a person is living truthfully to ones conscience . <p> In most instances concerning religion , it is through adoration or worship that people obtain a code of ethics and morality necessary for living . Everyone has a code of ethics and morality regardless of whether they consider themselves religious or not . In fact , religious liberty protects the atheist as much as the religious . Each of us has deeply held convictions and moral codes that we prioritize and use to dictate all of our actions , words and decisions . Religious liberty protects the ability of Christians to live out their convictions voluntarily and authentically . Here are some verses that explain authenticity from a Christian perspective : <p> So , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks through Him to God the Father . . . . Whatever you do , do your work heartily , as for the Lord rather than for men ( Col. 3:17 , 23 ) . good and acceptable and perfect ( Rom. 12:1-2 ) . <p> Everything a Christian does is to originate and emanate from our source of meaning : God . <p> Authority : Who has ultimate judgment ? <p> Even non-religious people believe someone , something or some ideology has ultimate say over lifes meaning . The nihilist responds that the highest authority is simply non-existence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedonist pleads for pleasures highest authority . The Darwinist says that natures systems and processes are the highest authority . A North Korean citizen believes that Kim Jong-un is the highest authority . <p> Not all claims of authority are equal . The fact that Western civilization is in the throes of a crisis of authority indicates that people have very different ideas on what is authoritative . But still , everyone has an authority . And because society is imperfect , an era where competing claims of authority challenge one another is normal and to be expected . <p> The question that is hard to answer in a liberal democratic context is whether someones view of authority is truly ultimate . Why ? Because who has the authority to say what is truly good or bad or to judge between competing understandings of right and wrong is up for debate as people reason about what is true . Here are some verses that explain authority from a Christian perspective : <p> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , whether good or evil ( 2 Cor. 5:10 ) . <p> The times of ignorance God overlooked , but man whom he has appointed ; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead ( Acts 17:30-31 ) . <p> From a Christian perspective , ultimate authority is found in God . The state is not ultimate . No ideology is ultimate . Jesus Christ is ultimate . From a Christian perspective , any secondary authority ( like the state ) that tries to be a primary authority ( like God ) is mistaken . <p> Conclusion <p> The Three As of Religious Liberty as Christians can be summed up in Deuteronomy 10:12-13 : <p> And now , Israel , what does the LORD your God require of you , but to fear the LORD your God , to walk in all his ways , to love him , to serve the LORD your God with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD , which I am commanding you today for your good ( Deut. 10:12-13 ) ? <p> In this verse , we see God possess authority over us by requiring something of us because of his ultimate power to command ; God requires our adoration to love and serve him ; and God desires us to do this in authentic form with our entire self ( our heart and soul ) . <p> Christians desire to worship God . Christians desire to bring their worship into every corner of their lives . And Christians give God the highest place of authority . These basic truths form the backbone of why religious liberty ought to matter to Christians . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Religious liberty can be a difficult concept to wrap our heads around .

Thus , I do weddings as a gospel minister of a local church , and not as a civil justice of the peace . That fact must shape how I understand my responsibility to God and to my congregation as I decide whether or not to officiate a wedding . <p> Marriage is a creation ordinance , given for all people for public good and human flourishing ( Gen. 2:23-24 ) . Believers and unbelievers marry for their own good , the good of their children , and the good of society as a whole .

@@100509243 @4709243/ <h> Accountability in community is crucial to Christian living <p> I remember hearing about the idea of an " accountability partner " for the first time when I became a Christian in my teens . In its best form , this is the person who makes sure you 're following the example of Christ . He or she is there to nudge you when you 're in sin or overlooking a weakness . <p> My accountability partner was my best friend and a guy I looked up to spiritually . The problem was , we did n't really hold each other accountable . We sinned together . We compromised together . We were unable to speak real truth to each other when it was needed most . <p> The idea of accountability partners never seemed to work for my friends and I , though our intentions were right . We wanted to be more like Christ but , at least in my experience , accountability partners werent pointing each other to Christthey were pointing each other to better morality . It was gospel-less , and therefore powerless . <p> Sadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum , avoiding accountability at all costs . They claim they have the right to privacy , buying into the lie that their business is theirs and no one elses . Others prop up excuses like introversion or lack of time for community . But in the end , those who avoid community are doing so at their own peril . <p> Why we need accountability <p> As Jeremiah 17:9 tells us , the heart is deceitful and sick . Even as regenerate believers , our hearts are still dealing with residual blindness , and theyll wander into danger without someone there to hold them back . We lament the phrase " just follow your heart , " and yet we follow our own hearts into the dangerous intersection of sin and death every time when we do n't seek accountability . We do n't  heed the words of Isaiah : " You were secure in your wickedness ; you said , ' No one sees me . ' Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray . You said to yourself , I exist , and there is no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became a Christian , I was dying for accountability . I wanted someone to share my struggles with , someone who could empathize or offer wise counsel . After being trained in theology and over a decade of following Christ , its become easier to think I 'm wise , and that people should be seeking me for accountability , not vice versa . Im tempted to be " wise in my own eyes , " not realizing that " there is more hope for a fool " ( Prov. 26:12 ) . <p> Jesus tells the Pharisees that he s come to make the blind see ; not just physical blindness , but spiritual blindness ( John 9:39-41 ) . The Pharisees and I ask Jesus the same question , " Are we blind ? " And he answers the same way , " You claim to be able to see , and so you are guilty . " As a Christian , then , I cant claim to be blind . I cant play the ignorance card . I cant say , " God , you did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible is clear about that . <p> Why one person is n't enough <p> As a husband , one of the people I 'm accountable to is my wife . She knows me better than anyone , she 's honest with me , and she loves me . I am safe with her . When she rebukes me , she does so rightly and for my good . But even though she 's my closest neighbor , she 's also deep in the forestshe ca n't always see the trees . I spend a lot of my day apart from her , particularly at work . More than that , I spend time on social media , saying things she does n't  always see , speaking into conversations she 's not always aware of . Its not because she does n't  care or because Im secretive ; she just ca n't be everywhere at once . She does n't  shadow me 24/7 . That 's not reality . <p> Because of this , I need more accountability than just her . Telling others , " I 'm only accountable to my family , " as I 've heard some say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us are the blindest to our sins . So I should also be accountable to the elders of my church , who " keep watch over my soul as those who will give an account " ( Heb. 13:17 ) , and to other local church members , who are commanded to hold me accountable for my sin ( 1 Cor. 5 ) . I 'm also rightly held accountable by my employer ( 2 Thess. 3:10-12 ) and the government ( Mark 12:17 ; Rom. 13:1 ) . <p> And this makes me the most uncomfortable : I should be accountable to other Christians who do n't  know me , too . The global church is the body of Christ , called to be concerned for one another because we all suffer together ( 1 Cor. 12:24-27 ) . If I 'm being a jerk on Twitter , another brother or sister in Christ has every right to call me out on it . They should do so in love , yes , but they have the rightthe responsibility ! to push me toward Christlikeness and away from Brandonlikeness . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank them for loving me . <p> According to Scripture , accountability is crucial to Christian living because community is crucial to Christian living . Allowing yourself to be held accountable by multiple layers of people is not only wise , its God-honoring . His word is clear in the passages above and many others about the extent to which individualistic living is inhumane . Humans were created for community , made to live under the authority of God and to be grafted into Christs body . The New Heavens and New Earth will be one big , eternal community party ( Rev. 21-22 ) . We will stand side-by-side , worshiping God and living life as new creations . Our false god of individualism will be destroyed . <p> If we believe that " iron sharpens iron " ( Prov. 27:17 ) , then we believe that we need each other . We do n't  need less accountability ; we need as much as we can get . Our hearts want to serve the gift-stealing father of lies , but they were made to serve the gift-giving Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong father .

To encourage further examination of the document , I 've compiled a list of highlights that will provide a broad and extensivethough nowhere near comprehensivesummary overview of their findings . <h> Sexual Orientation <p> Problem of Definition <p> The concept of sexual orientation is highly ambiguous , and can refer to a set of behaviors , to feelings of attraction , or to a sense of identity . <p> One of the central difficulties in examining and researching sexual orientation is that the underlying concepts of " sexual desire , " " sexual attraction , " and " sexual arousal " can be ambiguous , and it is even less clear what it means that a person identifies as having a sexual orientation grounded in some pattern of desires , attractions , or states of arousal . <p> There are currently no agreed-upon definitions of " sexual orientation , " " homosexuality , " or " heterosexuality " for purposes of empirical research . Because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ ambiguous terms like sexual orientation where they are used by the authors we discuss , but we will try to be attentive to the context of their use and the ambiguities attaching to them . " <p> Longitudinal studies of adolescents suggest that sexual orientation may be quite fluid over the life course for some people and that those who report same-sex attraction no longer do so as adults . <p> Genetic and Innate Factors <p> Research suggests that while genetic or innate factors ( e.g. , genes , hormones ) may influence the emergence of same-sex attractions , these biological factors can not provide a complete explanation , and environmental and experiential factors may also play an important role . <p> There is some evidence from the twin studies that certain genetic profiles probably increase the likelihood the person later identifies as homosexual or engages in same-sex sexual behavior . <p> The largest attempt to identify genetic variants associated with homosexuality , a study of over 23,000 individuals , found no linkages reaching genome-wide significance for same-sex sexual identity for males or females . <p> The weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors is modest . <p> Hormonal conditions that contribute to disorders of sex development may contribute to the development of non-heterosexual orientations in some individuals , but this does not demonstrate that such factors explain the development of sexual attractions , desires , and behaviors in the majority of cases . <p> Studies of the brains of homosexuals and heterosexuals have found some differences , but have not demonstrated that these differences are inborn rather than the result of environmental factors that influenced both psychological and neurobiological traits . <p> There is virtually no evidence that anyone , homosexual or heterosexual , is " born that way " if that means their sexual orientation was genetically determined . <p> Sexual Abuse Victimization and Other Environmental Factors <p> One study found that bisexuals had significantly higher proportions than heterosexuals of all adverse childhood experience factors , and that homosexuals had significantly higher proportions than heterosexuals of all these measures except parental separation or divorce . Overall , homosexuals had nearly 1.7 times , and bisexuals 1.6 times , the heterosexual rate of adverse childhood experiences . <p> Another study of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , homosexuals as well as bisexuals had about twice the lifetime risk of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) compared to the heterosexual reference group . Homosexuals , bisexuals , and heterosexuals with same-sex partners reported experiencing worse traumas during childhood and adolescence than the reference group . <p> While one study suggests that sexual abuse may sometimes be a causal contributor to having a non-heterosexual orientation , more research is needed to elucidate the biological or psychological mechanisms . Without such research , the idea that sexual abuse may be a causal factor in sexual orientation remains speculative . <p> One environmental factor that appears to be correlated with non-heterosexuality is childhood sexual abuse victimization . Non-heterosexuals are about two to three times as likely to have experienced childhood sexual abuse than heterosexuals . <p> In one major survey only 1.2 percent of males who had spent their adolescence in a rural environment responded that they had had a male sexual partner in the year of the survey while those who had spent adolescence living in metropolitan areas were close to four times ( 4.4 percent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter . <p> In that same survey women who attended college were nine times more likely to identify as lesbians than women who did not . <p> Distribution of Sexual Desires and Changes Over Time <p> There is now considerable scientific evidence that sexual desires , attractions , behaviors , and even identities can , and sometimes do , change over time . <p> While ambiguities in defining and characterizing sexual desire and orientation make changes in sexual desire difficult to study , data from these large , population-based national studies of randomly sampled individuals do suggest that all three dimensions of sexuality affect , behavior , and identity may change over time for some people . <p> Several researchers have suggested that sexual orientation and attractions may be especially plastic for women . <p> One survey found that 35 percent of self-identified gay men reported experiencing opposite-sex attractions in the past year , and 10 percent of self-identified gay men reported opposite-sex sexual behavior during the same period .

It appears that the rates of co-occurring substance use disorders , anxiety disorders , depression , and suicide tend to be higher for transgender people than for homosexual and bisexual individuals . <p> One report found that homosexual youth and adults and women in particular appear to be likelier than heterosexuals to smoke , use or abuse alcohol , and abuse other drugs . <p> Compared to heterosexuals , members of the non-heterosexual population are estimated to have 1.5 times higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders , 1.5 times the risk of substance abuse and about 2 times the risk of depression . <p> Combined worldwide studies showed up to 50 percent higher rates of mental disorders and substance abuse among persons self-identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesbian or bisexual women showed higher levels of substance abuse , while gay or bisexual men had higher rates of depression and panic disorder . <p> Sexuality and suicide <p> Compared to heterosexuals , members of the non-heterosexual population are nearly 2.5 times the risk of suicide . <p> Members of the transgender population are also at higher risk of a variety of mental health problems compared to members of the non-transgender population . <p> The rate of lifetime suicide attempts across all ages of transgender individuals is estimated at 41 percent , compared to under 5 percent in the overall U.S. population . <p> Compared to the general population , adults who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery continue to have a higher risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes . <p> Sexuality and Intimate Partner Violence <p> The weight of evidence indicates that the rate of intimate partner violence is significantly higher among same-sex couples . <p> Explanations for the Poor Health Outcomes : The Social Stress Model <p> In attempting to account for the mental health disparities between heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals , researchers occasionally refer to a social or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for some of the poor mental health outcomes experienced by sexual minorities , though the evidence supporting the model is limited , inconsistent and incomplete .

By contrast , the concept of gender is not well defined .

@@100509245 @4709245/ <h> 3 ways to respond to Massachusetts ' revolution on religious liberty <p> As a general rule , it is a bad idea for government to regulate religious activity . Neither the church , nor the state , are well equipped to meet the others objectives or obligations . And for this reason , society is better served when each entity operates with a healthy respect toward the others realm of authority . In fact , the encroachment of these boundaries almost always represents a serious threat to civil libertiesthus the Establishment Clause of the Constitution intentionally prohibits such incursions . But when the state is itself a willful actor in the progressive effort to effect social change , there is apparently little time for these concerns . <p> The state of Massachusetts has , for many years , been leading the charge of the progressive movement in terms of policy and legislation meant to both legalize and normalize various aspects of the sexual revolution . The recently published Gender Identity Guidance , an official document detailing enforcement of a new statewide anti-discrimination law , only furthers this trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling instructions , but of particular concern is the direct threat it poses to religious freedom in the state . <p> The anti-discrimination measures in the document are so restrictive that in certain cases they would not only require many religious institutions in the state to alter specific practices , but would interfere with the ability of these institutions to advocate particular theological beliefs . Clearly this is a monumental issue . <p> The Guidance does not threaten religious exercise head on , but instead insists that religious organizations such as local churches , would be subject to these restrictions when operating in a " secular " capacity . According to the document , " places of public accommodation may not discriminate against , or restrict a person from services because of that persons gender identity . " And while local churches are apparently not considered " public accommodations " when hosting distinctly sacred or spiritual events , that protection falls away " if it holds a secular event , such as a spaghetti supper , that is open to the general public . " This is problematic for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks a compelling interest to determine which of a religious organizations activities might be designated as secular . Indeed , many religious persons like myself would deny that such a dichotomy even exists . But moreover , the state is supposed to respect the right of religious institutions to exercise their autonomythis is , after all , what the " free exercise " of religion means . Setting up a regulatory agency as de facto arbiters of religious practice is nonsensical and profoundly ignorant . To avoid such category errors , the agency would see churches coerce participants at every event into observing obligatory rituals in order to satisfy the state . Make no mistake , this would soon spell the death of religious freedom in Massachusetts . <p> The culture is growing increasingly hostile to traditional beliefs about gender and sexuality . This Guidance represents another attempt to silence the opponents of the sexual revolution . But as evangelicals , we are n't  advocating these views for the sake of argument . We stand for the truth about gender , marriage , and sexuality because we believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we honestly believe that heaven and hell hang in the balance . And we open our mouths , despite the increasingly hostile cultural opposition , out of obedience to Jesus and love for our neighbors . <p> Indeed , we will not be silent about these issues , but we need more than outrage . We need more than private indignation . We need more than Tweetstorms or articles shared on Facebook . <p> Here are three things we desperately need : <p> Prayer : Prayer for America is often called for and seldom accomplished . I would ask you to pray for our nation , pray for our leaders and pray for Gods mercy to allow the light of the gospel to do its work . <p> Advocacy : Believe it or not , there are countless people working right now to protect religious freedom in America .

@@100509247 @4709247/ <h> Please say more than six words to your kids about sports or any performance <p> Brad M. Griffin from the Fuller Youth Institute posted an article , " The Only Six Words Parents Need to Say to Their Kids About SportsOr Any Performance . " I am sympathetic with some aspects of the article . He is rightly concerned that too many parents simply obsess on their childs performance in sports . He writes , " All kinds of parental anxiety and dysfunction plays out on the sidelines and in the bleachers , and you only need to walk to your local park to catch a glimpse for yourself . " Anybody involved in youth sports has seen the people Griffin is describing and perhaps weve even seen that type of person in the mirror . <p> My problem with his article is that his response to the problem he describes is woefully inadequate . Griffin suggests based on psychological research that the three healthiest statements moms and dads can make as their kids compete in sports are : <p> Before the competition : <p> Have fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the competition : <p> Did you have fun ? <p> I am proud of you . <p> I love you . <p> While all of those statements can certainly be helpful they are far from adequate in utilizing a child participation in sports as a tool for cultivating Christian discipleship and cruciform worldview . The Bible is far from silent on sports and athletic competition ( Gen. 30:8 , 32:24 ; Ps. 19:3-6 ; 2 Sam . 2:14 ; 1 Cor. 9:24-27 ; Phil . 3:13-14 ; Gal . 2:2 ; Eph. 6:12 ; Heb. 12:1-4 ) . The Apostle Paul consistently uses the language of athletic competition for talking about the demands and discipline of the Christian life . <p> I wonder if Griffin would provide the same advice to parents regarding a childs work in school ? What if the child has fun in school because they enjoy being the class clown ? What if the fun they have competing in sports is because they play selfishly or do not execute what the coach tells them to do ? Should a parent always be proud of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It seems to me that his advice trades a self-centered parents obsession about performance for a self-centered apathy about competition and the priority of team . <p> There 's a danger in telling children the most important thing about sports is that you have fun and feel good about yourself . The danger is that they might believe it . Sports do not build character ; they dramatically expose character and provide Christian parents and coaches with a valuable opportunity to develop Christian character . Our culture says , " Believe in and focus on yourself " and Jesus says , " deny yourself and follow me . " No one can do both . Our Christian lives demands courageous , self-sacrificial , Great Commission gospel warriors , and at its best , athletics provide Christian parents and coaches a limited but genuine theater for the examination and cultivation of Christ-honoring characteristics . <p> Children who are taught to simply focus on having fun and are rewarded for intentional underachievement are being cultivated in a worldview that is antithetical to self-sacrificial Christian discipleship . If youth sports participation simply becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires and feelings are more important than the good of others ( the team ) , we should not act surprised when they someday conclude that their desires and feelings are more important than the good of their family , church and everything else , too . Narcissistic laziness and self-protection are not fruits of the Spirit . <p> Griffin and I are in agreement that Christian parents should not focus on performance and success in youth sports . We also agree that a wonderful thing to tell your children is , " I love to watch you play . " But I would call Christian parents to say far more than Griffin advises . I suggest parents say , " I love to watch you compete because it gives us a window into your character that we can shape and form as we focus on Christ of God " ( 1 Cor. 10:31 ) demands self-sacrificial focus and effort . Playing sports heartily , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible in sweat , bruises and occasionally blood . <p> One of my favorite stories related to the cultivation of Christian character in youth sports comes from a friend of mine whose son is a fantastic baseball player . His sons team was playing a big tournament game . He was playing first base and made an uncharacteristic error that cost his team the lead . His sons response was to drop his head and slump his shoulders in self-pity . When he was in the dugout during the rest of the game he sat on the bench and pouted . <p> My friends son ended up coming to the plate in the final inning with the bases loaded and his team down three runs . There were two outs and the game was on the line . His son hit a grand slam walk-off home run to win the game for his team . His coach awarded him the game ball to celebrate the victory . But his father was far more concerned with his sons character than he was his sons performance . He told his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coach and apologize to his coach and teammates for his self-centered attitude during the game . The father told his son he was not proud of his selfishness but that he hoped he would learn from this how to respond in a self-sacrificial and others-centered way that would honor Christ . <p> If the dad would have responded , " Did you have fun ? " then his son would have certainly said , " Yes ! " and learned that his " fun " was contingent upon playing for his own satisfaction . If the dad would have said , " I am proud of you , " then his response would encourage a self-centered , performance-based attitude . But , my friend proved that he loved his son enough to use sports to teach him about something much more important than sports . Likewise , my friend also proved that he loved to watch his son play , so he could learn the priority of self-sacrificial , others-centered effort . <p> Before the competition : <p> Enjoy the opportunity to compete . <p> Play in a self-sacrificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When you make a mistake , respond by cheering all the harder for your teammates . <p> When your teammates make a mistake , encourage them . <p> Honor the officials/umpires/judges by showing respect and thanking them after the game . <p> Cheer as hard if you are on the bench as you would if you were in the game . <p> I love you . <p> After the competition : <p> What did you learn about yourself ? <p> Did you compete to the absolute best of your ability with no regrets about your effort ? <p> In what ways did you self-sacrifice for your team ? <p> How did you respond when you failed ? <p> Were you others-centered ? <p> Did you honor your coaches and the officials/umpires/judges ?

America is riven by racial unrest , violence and terrorism . Weve experienced heated politics and division among Christians . At times , we 've been disappointed and dismayed . <p> Many helpful things have been written about how we should engage various issues , but what about how we should pray ? Stewarding our influence in the public square and among our neighbors is important , but not nearly as important as our prayers before a God who hears because of the access purchased by Christ . <p> So , how should we pray for America ? Here 's a prayer guide that you might find helpful for individual , family or group use : <p> 1 . Pray for elected and appointed officials ( 1 Tim 2:2 ) . We talk and complain a lot about politicians , but do we pray as often as we should , as often as we are compelled to pray by scripture ? We should pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power well on behalf of the people ( Rom 13 ) , but also for the well-being of their families . My suggestion is that pray for all leaders , not just the ones with whom you agree . <p> 2 . Pray for candidates running for office ( 1 Tim 2:2 ) . Regardless of your feelings about the candidates running for local , state and federal offices , you have to admire anyone who is willing to risk public criticism and humiliation in stepping forward . Running for office takes a toll on candidates families , opens them up to unprecedented scrutiny and enacts a physical and mental toll . <p> 3 . Pray for public servants and first responders . Around the country , at this very moment , millions of men and women wear a uniform and have pledged to protect us from harm . Police officers , fire-fighters , paramedics , search and rescue teams and others put their lives on the line every day in an oft-thankless task . Pray for wisdom and discernment , pray they would use their power well , pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodbye , not knowing if their loved ones will return . <p> 4 . Pray for racial justice . It is clear that there is still much work to be done in our country to heal from our racial wounds and to see more racial progress . We should pray for more unity in our communities and in our country and for leaders who unite , rather than divide . Pray for minority populations who continue to experience prejudice and injustice . Pray for just laws to address racial disparities . Pray that the church will lead the way , showing by its steps toward racial reconciliation , a glimpse of the kingdom , where God will gather every nation , tribe , and tongue . <p> 5 . Pray for the recognition of human dignity . Everywhere we look , we see violations of human dignity , from abortion on demand , to the horrific rhetoric some leaders are using to talk about immigrants and refugees , to the violence erupting in the tough neighborhoods in our cities .

Pray the church would embody the kind of other-worldly values of the Kingdom and point people to the hope found only in Christ . Pray for pastors to boldly preach and teach the word of God and to courageously call their people to Christlikeness . <p> We do n't  always have the answers for the vexing problems that face our country .

Sitting there listening to one person after another share the story of how she impacted their life , I was surprised to see so many from her church in attendance . <p> Though she had been a member of a little Baptist church on the east side of Baltimore for decades , it had been many years since she was able to leave home for a service . I wondered how some of the younger church members even knew her . Yet , as I heard testimony after testimony of what my great aunt meant to them , I realized that the reason they knew her so well was because they had worshipped with her in her home . <p> According to the CDC , the elderly population in our nation is expected to increase over the next decade .

By 2030 , older adults will account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population . " <p> These population statistics have an impact on the Church as well . As the number of persons 65 years and older grows , the Church needs to be prepared to serve the increasing needs of its elderly members . In a mobile society that is no longer family centric , many of the elderly live far away from their children and support systems . This means that the Church has an important role in caring for the varying needs of the elderly , including , not only spiritual concerns , but health and mobility issues , emotional needs , and other practical concerns of daily life . <p> In a culture that values youth and vitality , the Church can reflect this priority as well . To be honest , the elderly are often unnoticed and overlooked . Those who are less active and mobile wont be included in church functions . Those who struggle with chronic illnesses may be unnoticed when they miss church . But the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church is a part of Christs Body , and as such , all serve an important function ( 1 Cor. 12:27 ) . Each member needs to hear the word preached , participate in the Lords Supper , use their gifts and receive help and encouragement from others in the Body . <p> This article seeks to address the question , how can we , as the Church , prepare for the needs of a growing elderly population ? What are some of those needs ? And what are some practical ways we can address those needs ? <p> 1 . Engaging : While those who are elderly may not be able to serve in the same way that they once did , it does n't  mean that they ca n't be useful to the Body . We need to think of creative ways to engage our aging church members . Perhaps they can no longer sing in the church choir or teach preschoolers but maybe they can pass out bulletins or greet visitors . They can also be an active participant in praying for the needs of church members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly list of prayer concerns to pray through at home . Some might also be able to serve the church by writing welcome notes to mail to new visitors or birthday cards to send to children in the church . <p> We can also draw from the years of wisdom our elderly brothers and sisters have gained in their life . We can seek their wisdom in matters related to the church , the ministry , and Christian living . In my own church , we have a number of retired pastors in our membership who use their wisdom and experience in leading small groups and Bible studies . And in the case of my great aunt , even the homebound can be an encouragement to others . As members in her church came to visit her , they were encouraged by her faith and joy , even as she struggled with chronic health problems . <p> 2 . Connecting : Depression is a serious concern for the elderly , particularly for those with chronic health conditions , those with limited mobility , and those who can no longer live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uselessness can make the days long and hard for them . In a conversation with a homebound brother in Christ , he shared how hard it was to be unable to get around . " I 'm just waiting to die , " he said . <p> As the Church , we need to be present , active , and connected in the lives our elderly church members . Often , as people age and face chronic illnesses , they ca n't leave home . This means that we need to reach out to them and visit them in their homes . Elders can bring them communion , provide them copies of sermons to listen to and sing hymns with them . Youth groups can come and help with needs around their home . Other volunteers can take them to doctors appointments or run errands for them . <p> 3 . Encouraging : As a person ages , the realities of death are more present than ever before . Pastors , elders , and other church leaders need to be intentional in ministering to the spiritual needs of the elderly , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need to reach out to them and have gospel conversations about the glories that lie ahead for them . No matter how long someone has been a believer , there can still be an element of fear and uncertainty about the future . Knowing that your body is failing and that you can do nothing to stop it is humbling . We need to pray with and for our elderly brothers and sistersthat they would remain steadfast in their faith and that the gospel would encourage them . <p> As the Baby Boomer generation ages , more of our population will face the challenges that come with getting older . The Church needs to be prepared to minister to and serve these challenges . We need to engage , connect and encourage our aging brothers and sisters in Christ until they cross the finish line and see their Savior face to face .

Churches are allowed to distribute voter guides , whether created by the church or prepared by other organizations . But there are a few parameters to keep in mind . When distributing a voter guide , the church needs to ensure that the guide is neutral and unbiased . For example , the voter guide should include all candidates for a particular office , include a wide range of issues and not show a preference for a particular candidate , issue or viewpoint . Overall , the voter guide should be informative , not argumentative . <p> 3 . Can I discuss candidates ? <p> It depends . In your personal capacity ( not your capacity as a church leader ) , you enjoy the same freedoms as every other American .

@@100509253 @4709253/ <h> How much economic value does religion provide America ? <p> But an increasing number of our fellow citizens are agnostic about God and skeptical that religion provides much benefit to our neighbors . This summer a Pew Research survey found that while a majority of U.S. adults still say religious institutions contribute either " a great deal " ( 19 percent ) or " some " ( 38 percent ) to solving important social problems , four-in-ten ( 39 percent ) now say religious institutions make little to no contribution in this area .

Perhaps . But the United States of America in the year 2014 is not one of those times and places . Rather , in our contemporary society , the only way to be good is to be heroic . Failing to act with heroism inevitably makes us complicit in grave evils . <p> Human life has been seriously devalued in our society . Millions of innocents are cruelly killed before they ever see the light of day . Other children are conceived in ways that reduce them to commodities , in which only the strongest and fittest are given a chance while those passed over are stored in freezers or used for research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great gift of human sexuality into an instrument for hedonistic self-satisfaction . <p> These trends have brought devastation and tragedy in their wake : deep psychological wounds and physical illness wrought by the hook-up culture ; a drastic rise in poverty among single mothers and their children caused by permissive divorce laws and the attitude that sex and babies are completely unrelated ; and finally , profound and pervasive harms to children who are the voiceless victims of family breakdown . <p> In the face of such carnage , too often it is tempting to think that the solution is to retreat from the broader culture , which is sick and dying from a highly contagious moral confusion . For some , the instinct is to try to isolate and save oneself and ones family from the contagion in a kind of self-imposed quarantine . But , aside from the fact that we have an obligation to help those suffering from this epidemic , retreat simply will not work .

It may sound far-fetched , but it has already happened in states like Massachusetts . Even 10 years ago , the prospect of legal recognition of same-sex marriage throughout the country sounded far-fetched as well . <p> In these circumstances , just being " good " is impossible . We inevitably will be faced with situations in which we must either give in or stand up for our convictions even at great personal cost . There is no " middle way . " Our times call for heroism , and we must be prepared to respond to that call . Many people have done so already . <p> Modern-day heroes <p> Think , for instance , of Julea Ward . Julea , a devout Christian , was studying at Eastern Michigan University to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program are required to do a practicum in which they counsel real clients . Preparing for an upcoming appointment with a new client , Julea reviewed his file and saw that the client had previously been counseled regarding his homosexual relationship . Because she knew that she could not , in good conscience , affirm this clients homosexual behavior , Juleaperhaps with some trepidationasked her supervisor what to do . The client was referred to another counselor . <p> Then came the universitys response : Julea was accused of " unprofessional conduct , " " an inability to tolerate different points of view , " " imposing values that are inconsistent with counseling goals , " and " discrimination based on sexual orientation . " Julea was told that she had three options : Go through a remediation program to change her " intolerant " views , leave the program or request a formal hearing . Unwilling to cave in under pressure and compromise her beliefs , she chose to request a formal hearing . At the hearing , she was questioned relentlessly as the faculty members tried to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While steadfast about her inability to affirm homosexual conduct , she also made clear she harbored no prejudice against those with same-sex attraction . She stated , " I 'm not opposed to any person ... I believe that ... God loves us all . " <p> Apparently loving the sinnerand recognizing that we are all sinnerswas not enough for Eastern Michigan University . To call homosexual behavior sinful was itself considered beyond the pale . The result of the hearing was that Julea , who had been a straight-A student , found herself expelled from the program . Julea tried to appeal the decision to the Dean , but to no avail . Thankfully , Julea was ultimately vindicated in 2012 after a three-year-long court battle . Otherslike the wedding photographer who refused to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony in New Mexicohave not been so fortunate . But in refusing to compromise her beliefs for the sake of professional success , Julea made a courageous choice , a heroic choicethe kind of choice that any one of us could foreseeably be called to make in the near future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris and Mary Anne Yep . Chris and Mary Anne have been heroic on many fronts . First , as the parents of 10 children , they were extraordinarily generous in their openness to life , even though this sometimes meant that Chris had to work three jobs , including a nighttime paper route , in order to support his young family in the early years of their marriage . As any parents of a large family can tell you , undoubtedly their generosity meant putting up with the judgmental stares and condescending comments of neighbors , friends , colleagues and medical practitioners . In a society where conventional wisdom holds that parents should give their children more things rather than more siblings , the Yeps have provided a heroic witness to the priceless treasure of human life , a witness for which their childrenone of whom was a top student in one of my classes at Catholic University of America last yearare very grateful . <p> The Yeps ' heroism does not stop there . Frustrated by the lack of family-friendly and person-centered policies in the medical field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidated their savings and started a business of their own , a business in which persons really came first . Their company , now called Triune Health Group , has flourished , and has recently been named one of the best places to work in Chicago . From flexible hours and work-from-home options that allow and encourage their employees to put family first , to keeping employees on the payroll when serious illness prevents them from being able to work , to going the extra mile to help their clientsfor instance , helping a depressed and discouraged paraplegic find a suitable job and get his life going againthe Yeps have offered powerful and heroic witness to how a commitment to human dignity can and should take pride of place even in the world of business . <p> Another aspect of the Yeps heroism was forced upon them with the passage of unjust laws by the state of Illinois and then the federal government , laws that required them to provide coverage for contraception , sterilization and abortion-inducing drugs in their employee health plan . In the face of this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , the Yeps once again stepped up to the plate to take a courageous stand , suing both the state of Illinois and the Obama administration for violating their First Amendment right to operate their business in accordance with their deeply held beliefs .

One hopes the respect for religion that the Supreme Court exhibited in its Hobby Lobby decision will decide the fate of the Yeps cases as well . <p> Heroism on campus <p> A final example of heroism that I would like to highlight is that of a young woman named Cassy Hough . When Cassy began her freshman year at Princeton in 2003 , she was appalled at the crass and permissive approach to human sexuality that was promoted on campus in everything from the quasi-pornographic freshman orientation programming to dorm meetings , course readings and extracurricular events . Speaking out courageously among peers and professors about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lack of understanding and outright disrespect . She eventually found a supportive group of friends , but she soon realized that she could not be content with just preserving herself from the dangers of the hook-up culture . <p> Seeing the tremendous pressure on her peers to conform to the reigning sexual orthodoxy , and witnessing the hurt , anger and emptiness that they suffered as a result , Cassy realized that she needed to do something to help spread the message of sexual integrity on campus and offer more students the necessary support to resist the hook-up culture . So she founded a group called the Anscombe Society , named for the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe , who was a great defender of the true meaning of human sexuality . Princetons Anscombe Society succeeded in helping many students understand , defend and live sexual integrity in many ways , including convincing the university administration to change the content of the freshman orientation program . <p> Cassy did not stop there . Friends from other universities began to ask her for advice about how to form similar groups on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization was needed to support and train student leaders across the country so that they , too , could promote sexual integrity on their campuses . After she graduated , she got a grant to start the Love and Fidelity Network , which has successfully pursued this important mission to the present day . Now the Love and Fidelity Network has groups and student fellows making the case for marriage and family and providing support for sexual integrity at more than 25 universities . <p> Like Julea , Chris and Mary Anne Yep , Cassy , and so many other heroes of our times , we must be prepared to live not just good , but heroic lives . We must be prepared to risk popularity , reputation , professional success , economic well-being , andit may yet come to thisperhaps even our lives , in order to defend the dignity of human life in all its stages , the value of sexual integrity , the truth about marriage and family , and the right to live in accordance with ones beliefs in all spheres of life . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices , we will resist the forces of the culture of death in our own lives , and , with Gods help , transform that culture into a culture of life .

He decided he would get up before school in the morning and run two miles on the treadmill to increase his stamina . But when the team began playing games , he rarely got off the bench , and I began to notice his demeanor as he sat on the sidelines . He seemed disinterested and chatty on the bench . He was only engaged and focused on the rare occasion he was put in the game . When he was on the floor , he was loud and fiery , but when he was on the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his seat and his posture was relaxed and slouching . <p> I heard one parent say about their son , who was in a similar situation , " Well , what do you expect when he is sitting the bench ?

I was pleased that my son was experiencing bench warming , because it would provide him with the opportunity to learn how to lead when finds himself out of the spotlight . Its actually the same thing I expect of him when he is a starter : that he would be a leader who uses every ounce of his ability and effort to glorify Jesus Christ .

" He glanced up at me with an incredulous expression . Why would I ask that when I had witnessed him sitting the bench the entire game ? So , from that point on we developed a strategy on how to lead from the bench . We sought to answer some basic questions : How can you sit the bench in a way that says , I am as committed to the success of the team here as I would be if I were shooting free throws with the game on the line ? How can you sit the bench and positively affect the other players on the bench and the players in the game ? How can you sit the bench in a way that honors your coach ? <p> Developing our plan began with an honest evaluation of the situation . I asked him , " Do you know why you are not playing in the games very much ? " Then I responded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not deserve to play very much on this team . Your coach is trying to play the best players to help the team win the games .

" <p> I was pleased to see that my son responded well to this honest call to courage and self-sacrifice for the sake of the greater good of his team .

@@100509260 @4709260/ <h> A path to future victory in the pro-life cause <p> Over a year ago , the series of awful videos emerged revealing that Planned Parenthood was selling the body parts of aborted babies . And this summer , the Supreme Court has reminded us once again that they claim to possess the authority to define human life . In its June decision , Whole Womens Health , the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that had successfully forced approximately half of the abortion clinics in the state to close . The Courts decision was a major blow to pro-life efforts in recent years . What was thought to have been a successful step for pro-life legislative advocacy was brushed away with apparent judicial ease by five black-robed justices in the nations highest federal court . <p> In the wake of this decision , it would be worthwhile for pro-life Americans to pause , take a deep breath and ponder the steps necessary for future victory . <p> Rebuilding the foundation for human rights <p> Ending the legality of abortion will require that society recognizes humanitys inherent value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an alarming speed . Therefore , it is vitally important to note the social context in which Americans presently find themselves . <p> A few years ago , I went to work on Capitol Hill during my first summer break from law school , presuming that I would be on the " front lines " of the pro-life movement . However , a tour through the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History taught me more about the battlefield for defining human life than the halls of Congress ever did . <p> Designed at a height low enough to reach elementary-aged children , one particular exhibit features a screen . When students peer into the screen it emits an image that adds ape-like features to the childs face falsely purporting to show the child what they would have looked like had the child been a mythological " pre-human ancestor . " <p> In addition , the Smithsonian currently sends out an exhibit entitled , " Exploring Human Origins : What does it mean to be human ? " It advertises with a poster featuring a man and woman alongside two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the family reunion in this Smithsonian traveling exhibition . " The Smithsonian assumes their tragic answer to the question with the lie that " being a human means being a more highly developed animal . " <p> The effects of this Darwinian dogma are evidenced in far more ways than just abortion . Weeks before the June Supreme Court decision , social media displayed how society was weighing the value of a young childs life with that of an endangered gorilla . Critics were enraged that killing the massive gorilla was even an option for zoo personnel who were able to save the childs life . <p> Even last summer , when the shocking undercover videos revealed that Planned Parenthood had been selling body parts of aborted babies , media attention focused for only a brief period on the nations largest abortion provider , represented by its president , Cecil Richards . With tragic irony , though , public attention was soon largely diverted to another Cecilthe lioninstead . Outcry in the media over a cat in Africa eclipsed the public horror of realizing that while Planned Parenthood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also gaining money from the sale of aborted baby body parts . <p> Our governments disgusting love affair with Planned Parenthood means that more tax dollars are given to the nations largest abortion provider under Title X than to any other private organization . We should n't be surprised by sins effects on society in this cursed world , yet we should n't be emotionally content about it either . Christians of all people should know that when the world ignores a problem , it does n't  mean that its not a big problem . Ignoring an injustice does n't  mean that its not an atrocious injustice . <p> Events in the last year remind us that the pro-life movement is only part of a larger movement to reclaim the sanctity of human life as Gods word defines it . The movement must go much deeper than mere legal advocacy . America needs advocacy over the very psyche of young minds who are daily being conditioned to think that their lives are of no greater worth than an animal and that , thus , their sexual ethic ought to be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally in the days ahead , it must win big in the hearts and minds of Americans . It must address underlying mindsets and stop dealing merely with the legal " fruit " of a society that prefers endangered animals over children . Pro-choice Americans are pro-choice largely because they have no vision for the sanctity of human life . They fail to see that human beings possess the imago Dei , the image of God . <p> Individual Christians have the great duty to " rescue those who are being taken away to death " ( Prov 24:11 ) . Individual Christians must step up to the plate and be vocal in order to elevate the value of human life in America . Whether its pursuing a certain school curriculum or approving/disapproving of sexually explicit entertainment or even simply saying something at the lunch table , Christians in America must be vocal with their everyday lives to effectively communicate a pro-life ethic . <p> The guarantee of victory <p> Personally , I have resolved not to look to politicians for my pro-life inspiration . To see victories on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates or human courts can ever offer us . We need a vision of God , who sits upon his throne , does all that pleases him and whose day of reckoning is surely coming . We need a vision of God , who was able to bring Nineveh to repentance in a single day . We need a vision of the gospelthe power of God for salvation . <p> You may never stand before the U.S. Supreme Court to advocate the pro-life position , but you can do something more powerful . You can advocate for the gospels message to the woman in your neighborhood who is stricken with the grief of a past abortion , or the local high school student whose girlfriend just found out she was pregnant , or the abortion clinic worker who frequents your local coffeeshop . You have the sole message in your heart that can bring true hope and salvation to those affected by this issue . <p> For the Christian pro-life advocate , success will not merely be a reality if the Supreme Court decides to change its mind . Success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision after decision , yet Christians press on to save innocent lives . Even if the day were to arrive when every justice on the Supreme Court became pro-abortion , Christians continue to love , to pray , to speak , to adopt , to provide ultrasounds , to propose bills , to march , to expose fraud , to counselall because we have a God who will make all wrongs right in the end , and because he has already made right our wrongs , including past abortions , through his Sons atoning death on the cross . <p> Christians can have an unshakable resolve in the face of legal defeat because we have a destiny that has been decided by the Highest Judge , and we know that his coming is not far off . Its with that kind of vision that we press on and remain lovingly and relentlessly pro-life . <p> Planned Parenthood again finds itself in a battle to protect its government funding and tarnished reputation , while secret investigators who uncovered the abortion giants latest scandal fight felony charges .

@@100509261 @4709261/ <h> What does it mean to be made in God 's image ? <p> The Christian faith and worldview is predicated on a set of nonnegotiable truths . One of these is that human life is inherently valuable . Christians have articulated and acted upon this transcendent understanding of human dignity throughout history , whether opposing infanticide and child abandonment , fighting against chattel slavery or engaging in civil disobedience to protest segregation . The powerful idea that every single person has inherent value is rooted in the image of God , a doctrine expressed in the opening chapter of Genesis . <p> Although " image of God " has become ubiquitous in Christian literature and conversation in recent years , it has not been robustly defined . Perhaps this is due to the lack of agreement throughout church history on what exactly constitutes image of God , which no doubt stems from the fact that Scripture declares but does not elaborate on the axiom in detail . <p> But much can and should be said . The fact that human beings are created in Gods image shapes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and one another . It informs how we understand the rest of the Bibles story and provides a theological foundation for ethics and engagement . In short , a proper understanding of the image of God should animate everything we do , and as a result , we should endeavor to define it biblically ; this will enable us to then survey what issues Christians should care about . <p> Different understandings of the image of God <p> Throughout church history , there has been universal agreement that image of God is a significant theological concept . But debate has abounded regarding what the image fundamentally refers to . <p> Some have argued in favor of a structural view that believes mans ontological ( the nature of being ) qualities , such as rationality and cognitive capacity , constitute the image of God . These qualities distinguish man from the rest of creation . Early church leaders , such as Irenaeus and Augustine , as well as John Calvin , held variants of this view . <p> Another position is the relational view that stresses the importance of mans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where being made in Gods image fundamentally entails living in relationship with God and others . <p> A third view is the functional or " vice-regency " position that posits mans derivative authority to rule on behalf of God defines the image . Unlike the rest of creation , it is man that functions as Gods chief representative in the world . This view stresses the command to exercise dominion ( Gen. 1:26-28 ) . <p> The image of God and Ancient Near Eastern culture <p> It is evident in Genesis 1 that the Bible is content with simply asserting that man is somehow like God . Further elaboration is not provided . Why is this ? As Bruce Ware has noted , technical terminology in speaking or writing is usually introduced and not explained in contexts where the audience is already familiar with specialized language . It seems fair to assume Moses was operating with this expectation . Therefore , considering Genesis 1 in light of the Ancient Near Eastern ( ANE ) usage of image of God might be helpful . <p> A seminal study on ANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in Man . Clines argues that ANE literature contains three commonalities in accounts that utilize image symbolism . First , a deity imputes a substance to an earthly king , enabling him to represent the divine . Second , the empowered king represents the deity by ruling as vice-regent . Third , only the king is ever given this privilege . <p> Applying this to Genesis , it is reasonable that Moses had this background in mind . First , God breathed into Adam the breath of life . Divine empowerment was requisite to function as Gods image . Second , man is tasked with exercising dominion and ruling as Gods vice-regent . Clines ' third characteristic , however , does not apply . The Bible surprises us at this point by affirming that everyone bears Gods image . Clines ' reconstruction of the ANE background is helpful and may account for why Moses did not furnish a more precise definition . His original readers would have had a framework to interpret image language and its connotations . <p> Through the lens of the ANE background , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional perspectives provide a holistic understanding of what it means to be made in the image of God ( i.e. , the structural serves the purpose of the functional carried out in relationship ) . <p> The image of God , therefore , includes both who man is and what he does . Ontological capacities and functionality are inseparably tied because the human person as a created whole is the image of God . <p> Man is like a statue erected by an ancient kingas the statue bore the image of the king and signified rulership , man bears Gods image in the cosmic temple of the world , representing his authority and dominion . Man is the visible representation of the invisible God . If one wants to know what God looks like , simply look at man , the crowning jewel of creation and the only creature made in Gods image and likeness . <p> The image of God and cultural engagement <p> One of the tragic results of sin is that man no longer properly images God ; the remnants of the image have been marred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history bears witness to mans inability to obey and honor God . <p> But the glorious truth of the New Testament is that restoration is possible through Christ , the perfect image of God ( Col. 1:15 ) , whose redeeming work restores the image to repentant sinners and establishes them as co-heirs with Christ . <p> In this light , the Biblical understanding of mans creation in Gods image has stunning implications for Christian ethics . Not only is everyone created in Gods image , but every human being is a potential future ruler of the universe . <p> C.S. Lewis poignantly remarked : " It is a serious thing . . . to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which , if you saw it now , you would be strongly tempted to worship . " <p> In the new creation , God will once again set up his image bearers . But this time , Gods vice-regents will be perfect because of their union with Christ . Paradoxically , the new creation has already begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be consummated when he returns . <p> And as Christians waiting patiently for this day , we will endeavor to treat people made in Gods image with dignity and respect irrespective of gender , race , age , nationality or economic status because we remember our Kings words that as we did for " the least of these my brothers , you did also to me " ( Matt. 25:40 ) . <p> Thus , we will care for those caught in the vice grip of poverty . We will fight against human trafficking . We will uphold the dignity of the elderly and disabled . We will advocate on behalf of immigrants . We will work for religious liberty and conscience freedom . We will stand for marriage . We will promote racial reconciliation .

With the help of Tim Ellsworth , David uses his story to make much of the eternal life and satisfaction he s found in Christ . This section , written before the Rio Olympics and the silver medal he and Steele Johnson won ( check out their interview ) , picks up at the end of his story , looks forward to the future and highlights some of the encouragement that has been most beneficial to his walk with Christ . <p> The competitive fire that has burned within me since childhood is still there . I want to win every event I compete in , and Rio in 2016 will be no different . But as I age and mature , I gain a better understanding of what goes into that . I know I do n't  have control over my competitors and how well they dive , so the outcome is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full potential , I hope to be one of the top contenders for a medal in Rio . <p> At the same time , the thought of another Olympics and the potential aftermath intimidates me a little . I 've walked through the challenges that came in the aftermath of a gold medal in London , and I know how easy it is to believe the lies that come with such exposure . I understand now , however , what to expect if God chooses to put me in the position to win gold again . <p> I hope you 've encountered something in my story that connects to your life and your circumstances . Allow me to leave you with a few final encouragements that God has revealed to me and that have been beneficial to my walk : <p> 1 . Do n't  live by how you feel , but by what you know to be true . Gods truth through Scripture gives us all the guidance we need for living godly lives . Your old self ( before Christ ) would live by how you felt . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to live that way . You are free from that bondage . Sometimes our culture wants to preach that we should live by our emotions and do what feels good . While that may provide satisfaction for a moment , it ultimately leads to heartache and despair ( Galatians 2:20 ) . <p> 2 . Take your thoughts captive . Sin is the enemy . As followers of Christ , we are called to battle it valiantly and vigorously . Do n't  be passive in the war against sin and resign yourself to the fact that you have no control over your thoughts . You do ! God provides grace and will help you in the fight . Our obedience to Christ must be marked not just by how we act externally but by how we think inwardly . You do n't  have to give in to sinful thoughts . Take them captive to obey Christ ( 2 Corinthians 10:5 ) . <p> 3 . Be process oriented , not results oriented . Remember the Olympic creed ? The important thing is not the triumph but the fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our hands and we are dependent on things we cant control for the outcomes we desire . Learning instead to focus on the process , the journey itself , allows us to focus our energies more on the things we can control . That , in turn , leads to greater fulfillment and more enjoyment as we go through life leaving our ultimate path in the Lords hands ( Psalm 37:5 ) . <p> 4 . Put your hope in the right place . For the first several years of my life , I tried my utmost to find lasting satisfaction and joy in things that were never designed to provide themin the creation rather than the Creator . I thought the Olympics and a gold medal were a surefire way for me to be happy for life . The result ? Destruction , despair , and disillusionment . Fame is fleeting . Riches can vanish in an instant . Pursuing such temporary pleasures may provide some momentary joy , but not joy in its fullest as God designed his people to have it . True joy on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with Jesus Christ ( Titus 3:17 ) . <p> 5 . All I have is Christ . The most important decision you will ever make is whether to follow Jesus Christ , submitting to his lordship , turning from your sin and rebellion , and trusting in his sacrificial death on the cross as your only hope of salvation . You can take the gold medal away from me . You can take my health and my career . You can take my particular church . And as much as I love them , you can take my friends and my family . If all I have is Jesus , then Jesus is enough . Its a scary thought , yes , but true . He is worth every sacrifice you may have to make . He is worth every struggle in this life you may have . The Bible says that Jesus is the way , the truth , and the life , and that no one comes to the Father except through him ( John 14:6 ) . He is my only hope , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 for me ? I honestly do n't  know . I know that I cant keep diving competitively forever , but I cant tell when I 'll officially have to call it quits for good . That uncertainty is difficult for me because I 've always been a planner with clear goals and objectives to pursue . The nebulous future , in a way , makes me uneasy . <p> But while I may not know what my future holds , I do know the one who holds it . He is the same one who has been walking beside me all along , calling to me when I was rebelling against him , rescuing me from the depths of my sin , redeeming my purpose from the emptiness and hopelessness that once characterized it , and giving me a life that has eternal significance and meaning . The gold medal I chased and ultimately won will one day tarnish and fade . Jesus instructed us not to store up for ourselves treasures like that on earth , where moth and rust destroy . Instead , we are to lay up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there our hearts will be also ( Matthew 6:2021 ) . <p> For much of my life , my heart was consumed with the earthly treasures that did not and could not satisfy the deepest longings of my soul .

So in 1928 , leaders from the United States and 14 other countries , including France and Germany , gathered in Paris to sign the Kellogg-Briand Treaty renouncing war and calling on nations to resolve disputes through pacifist means . <p> In his statement from the east room of the White House in July 1929 , President Herbert Hoover announced , " I dare predict that the influence of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War will be felt in a large proportion on all future international acts . " Within just 12 years , every nation that signed the Kellogg-Briand Treaty was engaged in World War II . <p> Declaring peaceand even desiring peaceare much easier than achieving peace . <p> The fight to make peace <p> Few of us are asked to ratify international peace treaties , but all of us understand the challenge of strained relationships . At times , we find ourselves in the middle of the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking in . Either way , the faithful Christian has a responsibility to make peace , but making peace often requires more of a fight than we first expect . <p> When Jesus said , " The peacemakers are blessed , for they will be called sons of God " ( Matt. 5:9 ) , he was not encouraging us to play the pacifist by sweeping problems under the proverbial rug . That is the work of peacekeeping , not peacemaking . Peacekeeping appeases the loudest , rudest voice in the room just to quiet an argument . Peacekeeping settles for injustices because the work of justice is simply too much trouble . <p> God condemned that kind of triviality when he said , " They have treated My peoples brokenness superficially , claiming , Peace , peace , when there is no peace " ( Jer. 6:14 ) . Declaring peace is easier than making it . <p> Our first conflict <p> Perhaps the reason for that is the personal nature of war and peace . Our first conflict is not with the people around us but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sin is an offense against God and puts a distance between him and us . Although we may try to close the gap , the only way to make things right is to completely remove the offense . <p> We talk about making peace with God , but he never expects us to make peace with him . Instead , through Jesus death , burial and resurrection , he removed our sin and replaced it with his righteousness . Therefore , it is by grace through faith that our offense is removed and reconciliation with God is achieved . We do not make things right . Instead , we can have peace with God because Jesus did the essential work of reconciliation on our behalf . <p> And the peace we have with God then produces the peace of God in the hearts of his people . Notice these words from the apostle Paul , " Do n't  worry about anything , but in everything , through prayer and petition with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God . And the peace of God , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ Jesus " ( Phil . 4:6-7 ) . These were not trite words meant to minimize a problem . Paul wrote them from a prison cell to believers who were facing pressure and persecution of their own . <p> When we have peace with God , the peace of God defends us against fear . And the peace of God shows us how to thank him in everything because we know that nothing can separate us from the love of God ever again . <p> The pursuit of peace with man <p> It is from this place of reconciliation with God that believers do the work of true peacemaking in the world . Christians are the benefactors of Gods mercy , which gives us a ministry of mercy to others . We understand that human conflict is not primarily ethical , political or relational . Instead , it is theological . So real peacemaking invites others to the same cross of Christ that rescued us . <p> Again , Paul wrote , " Everything is from God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) While relational conflict is a glaring apologetic of the universal need for the gospel , the peacemaker does the work of the evangelist by personally testifying to the peace of God found in Jesus his Son . <p> When Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the Sunday before his crucifixion , he visited the temple court where he found vendors selling temple sacrifices for ridiculous profits . He turned their tables over and threw them out as he said , " It is written , My house will be a house of prayer , but you have made it a den of thieves " ( Luke 19:46 ) . <p> Sometimes we interpret this moment as Jesus temper tantrum , perhaps to justify our own propensity to outbursts of anger . But Jesus did not throw a temper tantrum . Instead , he confronted the sinful actions of people who were hurting others by making it harder for them to know and worship God . <p> Everyone else had spent years living with the abuse and looking the other way . But peacemakers can not look the other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacemakers roll up our sleeves and take action on behalf of hurting people . <p> Jesus knew peacemaking would cost him , but peace was worth it . We do not step into the conflict because we are offended . We act because people need to hear the good news that God loves them , Jesus died for them , and they can have peace with God forever . <p> So peacemakers are not bullies looking for a fight , but neither are peacemakers appeasers who sit back while injustice oppresses the weak or discourages the fallen . Peacemakers speak the truth in love and then act with courageous mercy to make peace where there is no peace . <p> Some people suggest that Jesus is an anti-war pacifist . That is not true .

I do not believe this to be the fault of our brothers , but the sin of silence and apathy instead . <p> Particularly on issues like racial reconciliation , cultural engagement , a pro-life ethic , and femininity , the voice of evangelical women is needed to complete a part of the conversation otherwise lacking . <p> Why should evangelical women speak up ? <p> In his book , 7 Women , Eric Metaxas writes brief biographies of seven women whose lives were , and are still , influential not because they were the first to do or achieve something a man already had , but distinctively because they were women .

" <p> Now , you may not be fond of all the women Metaxas chose for the book , but the point remains that women , when operating within their unique femininity , bring an element of influence to the table that only a woman can . <p> Sisters , we must recognize that leaving our brothers to entertain and maintain these conversations is a disservice to them , ourselves , and the culture around us .

Hannah More was a woman who stood boldly for the abolition of the British slave trade , advocated for the education of women and the poor , sought to bear Christian witness in a morally corrupt culture , and promoted the goodness of Gods creative distinctions between men and women . <p> " Is it not better to succeed as women , than to fail as men ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In politics and in culture , Hannah More understood that bearing Christian witness would at times look similarly and at other times differently from her male counterparts , but that she was not any less responsible to bear these convictions .

@@100509266 @4709266/ <h> 10 ways to plan a Christ-centered wedding <p> If you are just setting out in the process of planning a wedding it 's easy to become overwhelmed ( and stay that way ) from the very beginning . So my mom and I developed a list of " 10 Ways to Have a Christ-Centered Wedding " in order to aid couples in thinking through options and prioritizing the process . <p> Now let me tell you what this is not . This is not as simple as checking off a list of " Christ-Centered Wedding Tips " to ensure the gospel is proclaimed and at the heart of the wedding . As with other aspects of life , its our hearts that matter . So in the following list , you will see 10 ways to look at your heart as you plan a wedding . We believe a " Christ-centered wedding " flows from these things . <p> 1 . Pray . A Christ-centered wedding begins with a Christ-centered heart . So pray for some of these to be realities : <p> That God will draw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That he will drive the beauty of gospel truth deeper into your heart <p> That you will reflect his grace and love to others <p> That you will , by his grace , better understand your identity in Christ <p> That your marriage will begin at the foot of the cross , where you experience the freedom only found through Christs sacrificial love on your behalf <p> 2 . Know Christ . In order for weddings to reflect Christ , we must first truly know him . Spend time in his Word , learning what it means to be part of the church ( Christs bride ! ) and what he has done for you . Your wedding will be a reflection of what you believe about your true Bridegroom . <p> 3 . Receive Christ-centered pre-marriage counseling . Begin counseling early , and meet with your counselor often . Its easy to put it off , but the chaos of wedding planning is easier to keep in check when you are focusing on marriage more than wedding . <p> 4 . Make gospel proclamation the goal . Revelation 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church will be gathered with our Bridegroom , Jesus . When we focus on this , our present weddings become pictures of this future reality . One of the benefits of having your local pastor perform the ceremony is the freedom of trusting him to share the gospel during the ceremony . But there are many other ways couples can proclaim Christ to their witnesses , beginning with number 5 below . <p> 5 . Have a wedding of worship . One of our favorite things to see in weddings is the bride and groom standing together with the bridal party and witnesses , all focused on the same mission--worshiping their Creator God together . Congregational song worship , Scripture readings , foot-washing , circle prayers--these are all ways to focus the wedding on worship , not of the bride or groom , but of their Savior . <p> 6 . Treat others with the love and mercy of Christ . Whether its family , friends , vendors , pastors , future family or anyone else you come in contact with during wedding planning , you have a choice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , you will have opportunities to lay aside your own " rights , " sacrificing out of love for others . And when you do this , you are giving these people a glimpse of Christ in you , who laid aside His own rights in order to serve and love us ( Philippians 2 ) . <p> 7 . Look for opportunities to serve others as Christ served you . You will be surrounded by people who want to serve youvendors , shower hostesses , the bridal party and more . But instead of demanding everything be about you , you have the chance to serve others . Bring gifts to hostesses , talk with friends about their lives instead of just your wedding , get to know your vendors . And when you do this , once again you are representing Jesus , who did not come to be served , but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many ( Mark 10:45 ) . <p> 8 . Continue to nurture love for your future spouse . Planning a wedding can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse . Schedule date nights when you can go through a Christ-centered marriage book , or even fun nights when wedding talk is off-limits . Protect your relationship and do n't  let the wedding take over . <p> 9 . Prepare for a Christ-centered marriage . Spend personal time in prayer leading to the wedding , asking God to work in your heart through his Holy Spirit to make you the husband or wife he would have you be . Study the life and words of Jesus , and pray for grace and strength to live in the freedom and joy of what He has done for you . <p> 10 . Distinguish between the essentials and the non-essentials . When you make the presentation of the gospel the over-riding essential , its easier to determine what things are not essential . There is a freedom in letting the other stuff go , rather than stressing over every tiny detail . When you want people to be impressed with Christ , not with you , it frees you up to focus on the most important things , like having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many couples choose to have lengthy engagements , using the extra time for wedding planning , financial planning and relationship building .

@@100509267 @4709267/ <h> 5 Ways to Help Your Child Succeed in Public School <p> As novice parents in our mid-twenties , my husband , Scott , and I initially spent a significant amount of time thinking , researching and praying over the educational options available to us as our firstborn , Ethan , approached his elementary years in the late 1990s . I recall with stunning clarity the sense of gravity I felt over this decision , as if one instructional choice prior to kindergarten would forever alter the person he would become . <p> While wrestling with the school possibilitiesprivate , home , publicwe were simultaneously being drawn toward adoption as a means of enlarging our family . The pursuit of two international adoptions within four years of Ethan starting elementary school required much financial wisdom and creativity on our part . It was through this commingling of substantial family decisions that we felt assured in our choice to place Ethan , and subsequently our daughters , in the public education systemembracing this direction as an intentional family affair , not simply a default option . <p> In 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sisters are now attending the affiliated middle school . In the years since our children became a part of this school system , we have undoubtedly been blessed by a quality school district which is comprised of committed , caring educators who value parental involvement and input . We have likewise learned several noteworthy lessons about navigating our way as a Christian family through the environment of todays public education . <p> 1 . Do Your Homework <p> Research your childs school district . Effectively navigating public education requires an awareness and understanding of the realities and traits unique to your particular school system and its governing leadership . Start by reading about the school online . Talk with other parents in your community to learn about their experiences within your particular district . Most schools will also offer some variation of school tours or open houses for new or transfer students . It is important to remember that what is true for a school in one community may not be so in a neighboring town . Similarly , use caution when making generalizations about public education based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school not your own . <p> Some helpful questions to consider as you explore your local public school include the following : <p> Who are the school board members and the superintendent ? <p> Does the school have an educational philosophy or mission ? <p> What curriculum is being used for your childs grade level ? <p> For middle and high school , is the health curriculum abstinence based or comprehensive sex education ( and if the latter , will the school allow parental opt-out for controversial topics ) ? <p> Is parent involvement welcomed or discouraged ? <p> In addition to academic , athletic and social opportunities , do the students have access to extra-curricular faith-based initiatives such as FCA , Campus Life , Young Life or student-led bible studies ? <p> What are some of the schools strengths , and what are the most significant challenges the school faces ? <p> 2 . Build Bridges , Not Walls <p> Communicate well and respectfully with the adults who will be a regular part of your childs day . Learn the names of office staff , teachers assistants , bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often and creatively as possible : send notes , bake cookies , leave small packages of candy in their in-boxes , or organize a staff appreciation luncheon with other parents . Be proactive in connecting with your childs teacher(s) early in the year to learn how you can support him or her in the classroom and to share any specifics about your child you feel the teacher should know . When you observe a teacher or staff member going the extra mile , you go the extra mile as well ; send an email of commendation to the individual with a carbon copy to the appropriate supervisor . Encouraging , friendly interactions will build a foundation of trust so that if you do have a legitimate concern to share , it will likely be heard with more receptivity . <p> 3 . Get Involved <p> When the school asks for help , JUMP IN if you 're able ! Whether you coordinate a class party , chaperone a field trip , volunteer at a fall festival , work a shift for the band concert , attend a PTO meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodies for the golf team , you will be making a purposeful effort to connect , building meaningful relationships . Meaningful relationships can lead to gospel opportunities . <p> 4 . Train Your Children Well At Home <p> Regardless of educational choice , all Christian parents are called to homeschool ( Deut. 6:7 ) . Scripture is clear that parents are to be the primary disciple-makers in the lives of their children . This means instructing children from their earliest days about our sin nature , as well as the nature and character of God and what He has done in the person and work of Jesus Christ . We must deliberately cultivate a Christian worldview and equip our children to identify , filter and respond to lessons that are contrary to our biblical convictions as we guide them toward maturity . <p> 5 . Advocate Directly and Respectfully <p> When a difficult situation arises , begin with your childs teacher . Sometimes a quick email to ask a clarifying question is helpful , but be prepared to make an appointment . While email is fast and easy , face-to-face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be polite and tactful . Document everything : what has occurred to cause concern and any further actions , meetings , or contact about the matter . If a suitable solution can not be reached with your childs teacher , request to meet with the guidance counselor or the principal . <p> Throughout the years , God has continually reminded us of both His sovereignty and His purposes for our family to remain in public school . Countless stories have been shared around the dinner table about the blessings , friendships , Divine appointments , and how the Lord is working through challenges in the hallways of a public school . The same God who " gave Daniel favor and compassion " ( Dan . 1:9 ) in Babylon , a culture set against the precepts of God , is just as able to guard today our children whom we entrust to Him amidst a rapidly shifting culture . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176 
@@100509268 @4709268/ <h> Women , stop submitting to men ? <p> Those of us who hold to so-called " traditional gender roles " are often assumed to believe that women should submit to men . This is n't true . <p> Indeed , a primary problem in our culture and in our churches is n't that women are n't  submissive enough to men , but instead that they are far too submissive . <p> First of all , it just is n't so that women are called to submit while men are not . In Scripture , every creature is called to submit , often in different ways and at different times . Children are to submit to their parents , although this is certainly a different sort of submission than that envisioned for marriage . Church members are to submit to faithful pastors ( Heb. 13:17 ) . All of us are to submit to the governing authorities ( Rom. 13:1-7 ; 1 Pet . 2:13-17 ) . Of course , we are all to submit , as creatures , to our God ( Jas. 4:7 ) . <p> And , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:22 ; 1 Pet . 3:1-6 ) . But that 's just the point . In the Bible , it is not that women , generally , are to submit to men , generally . Instead , " wives " are to submit " to your own husbands " ( 1 Pet . 3:1 ) . <p> Too often in our culture , women and girls are pressured to submit to men , as a category . This is the reason so many women , even feminist women , are consumed with what men , in general , think of them . This is the reason a womans value in our society , too often , is defined in terms of sexual attractiveness and availability . Is it any wonder that so many of our girls and women are destroyed by a predatory patriarchy that demeans the dignity and glory of what it means to be a woman ? <p> Submitting to men in general renders it impossible to submit to ones " own husband . " Submission to ones husband means faithfulness to him , and to him alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Submission to a right authority always means a corresponding refusal to submit to a false authority . Eves submission to the Serpents word meant she refused to submit to Gods . On the other hand , Marys submission to Gods word about the child within her meant she refused to submit to Herods . God repeatedly charges his Bride , the people of Israel , with a refusal to submit to him because they have submitted to the advances of other lovers . The freedom of the gospel means , the apostle tells us , that we " do not submit again to a yoke of slavery " ( Gal . 5:1 ) . <p> Despite the promise of female empowerment in the present age , the sexual revolution has given us the reverse . Is it really an advance for women that the average high-school male has seen images of women sexually exploited and humiliated on the Internet ? Is it really empowerment to have more and more women economically at the mercy of men who freely abandon them and their children , often with little legal recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when restaurant chains enable men to pay to ogle women in tight T-shirts while they gobble down chicken wings ? How likely is it that a woman with the attractiveness of Henry Kissinger will obtain power or celebrity status in American culture ? What about the girl in your community pressured to perform oral sex on a boyfriend , what is this but a patriarchy brutal enough for a Bronze Age warlord ? <p> In the church it is little better . Too many of our girls and young women are tyrannized by the expectation to look a certain way , to weigh a certain amount , in order to gain the attention of " guys . " <p> Additionally , too many predatory men have crept in among us , all too willing to exploit young women by pretending to be " spiritual leaders " ( 2 Tim . 3:1-9 ; 2 Pet . 2 ) . Do not be deceived : a man who will use spiritual categories for carnal purposes is a man who can not be trusted with fidelity , with provision , with protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who will not guard the moral sanctity of a woman not , or not yet , his wife . <p> We have empowered this pagan patriarchy . Fathers assume their responsibility to daughters in this regard starts and stops in walking a bride down an aisle at the end of the process . Pastors refuse to identify and call out spiritually impostors before its too late . And through it all we expect our girls and women to be submissive to men in general , rather than to one man in particular . <p> Women , sexual and emotional purity means a refusal to submit to " men , " in order to submit to your own husband , even one whose name and face you do not yet know . Your closeness with your husband , present or future , means a distance from every man who is n't , or who possibly might not be , him . <p> Your beauty is found not in external ( and fleeting ) youth and " attractiveness " but in the " hidden person of the heart " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pet . 3:3-4 ) . And it will be beautiful in the sight of a man who is propelled by the Spirit of this God . <p> Sisters , you owe no submission to Hollywood or to Madison Avenue , or to those who listen to them . Your worth and dignity can not be defined by them . Stop comparing yourselves to supermodels and porn stars . Stop loathing your body , or your age . Stop feeling inferior to vaporous glamor . You are beautiful . <p> Sisters , there is no biblical category for " boyfriend " or " lover , " and you owe such designation no submission . In fact , to be submissive to your future husband you must stand back and evaluate , with rigid scrutiny , " Is this the one who is to come , or is there another ? " That requires an emotional and physical distance until there is a lifelong covenant made , until you stand before one who is your " own husband .

My oldest son is eight years old and in second grade at our neighborhood public school . He has classmates with lesbian parents , and he has seen men out in public holding hands . This has raised a number of questions from him , so we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up earlier with my four-year-old because of exposure . The important thing is to keep the lines of communication open . This is not a one-time " talk . " It is an ongoing , honest conversation . <p> TN : I have young children ( five and eight ) , so we have not jumped into the deep end of the pool on these topics . Thus far , we make sure to name body parts by their proper name so its not strange or awkward ( as if God did not design our bodies ) . The kids understand that boys and girls are created by God with unique differences . <p> SG : This really depends on your child and your childs environment . While you want to guard against introducing sexuality and related issues to your children before they are emotionally and developmentally ready , it is an even greater risk in our culture and tech-driven world that your children will learn about sexuality from someone else . The goal should be that your kids first exposure to sexual information is from you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will be comfortable coming to you for counsel . <p> JS : As parents , we know our kids best , and we should use wisdom as we consider when to have these discussions . Ask yourself : What is their social environment ( friends , teachers , neighbors , advertising ) teaching them ? Have they begun asking questions ? Am I reluctant to talk with my child just because it feels uncomfortable ? <p> How would you go about explaining same-sex marriage to your children ? How would you distinguish what Gods design is ? <p> JO : You can help children understand same-sex marriage by studying Gods design for marriage . Give them lots of stories about marriage from the Biblefrom Creation to Revelation . I would tell them that same-sex marriage is not marriage as God defines it . Make sure your child knows that this is not your idea that you are teaching but Gods idea from the beginning of the world until now . <p> You can say something like , " Many people do n't  know and believe the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can know what God is saying to us about how life works best and how to honor him . In the Bible , God says that same-sex marriage is wrong , just like having sex outside of marriage , lying , stealing and worshipping other gods is wrong . Even if we do n't  understand everything God is telling us in the Bible , we know that he is kind , wise and wants what is best for his children . So we will trust and obey his ways . " <p> KI : We have simply explained that there are some men who choose to be with and marry other men and some women who do the same with women . This is not the way that God has created us to be . We assure our son that God has stated very clearly in the Bible that he made marriage to be between a man and a woman , so this relationship is against Gods design . <p> SG : Explaining same-sex marriage and homosexuality to your children is easier if , and should be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and biblical sexuality to your children . This will aid greatly in helping explain why homosexual expression and same-sex marriage are outside of Gods design , no matter what our culture or our laws may say . And , again , this is much easier if it is addressed by the parent , on the parents initiative , rather than something learned via media , teachers or peers . <p> JS : I would say something like , " In Genesis , God created men and women to complement one another . In his perfect plan , he made us different and proclaims it a good thing because it follows his design for all of creation . But because mankind is sinful and runs away from God , we want to make our own rules and not follow Gods design for us . The Bible tells us that people loved the darkness rather than the light. In other words , we do n't  want to be obedient to Gods commands , and sometimes this shows up in who people want to marry . " <p> How would you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor or classmate with whom they disagree ? <p> JO : Do not let them hear you ostracize others for their beliefs . Let there be sympathy , grace and longing for those who do n't  know the truth of the Bible yet . We do n't  want to raise finger-pointing Pharisees or become people who point out or talk about others sinswe have enough of our own sin to deal with . Let 's love our friends with whom we disagree and emphasize that Jesus died for the sins of the world , ours included . <p> If a someone asks , you can tell your child to share what he/she believes , and why : " Because the Bible is Gods Word to us , and in our family , we believe the Bible and want to obey it . " Remind your children that what God looks at is the heart ; people who are living in a same-sex relationship need a new heart , just as people who are having sex before marriage need one . Also , teach your children to pray for them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They understand that some things are right and others are wrong and may have a hard time with those who want to blur the lines or completely disagree with them . It is important to show them how Jesus related to those who were in sin . He felt compassion for them ( Matt. 9:36 ) and loved them in word and deed . <p> In our home , we are honest about these issues ( in an age-appropriate way ) , but we stress that someone who is living this lifestyle needs to know and understand the love of Jesus . Trying to show them the reasons their choices are wrong is not going to convey that love . We must remember that our kids are taking their cues from us . If we are unloving toward those with sexual sin , we can expect our children to act the same way no matter how much we remind them to love others . <p> SG : Teaching through Jesus interaction with sinners is a great way to show how Jesus was always full of mercy yet never wavered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion toward those with whom we disagree is to listen to and understand more of their stories and how they ended up where they are , while helping our kids to understand how to allow Scripture to shine light on those experiences . <p> JS : Sometimes our kids hear other kids using bad language , and they naturally want to label them " bad kids . " We remind them that our sinslying , bad attitudes , laziness , hatefulnessare just as " bad , " and we need forgiveness just as much as they do . Jesus spent time with people who did a lot of bad things and loved them . When we separate ourselves from other people , we are saying we do n't  need as much forgiveness as they do . So , when our kids see two women walking down the street holding hands , we should help them remember that Jesus came to set people free from their sin , including us . <p> How would you train your child to talk about these things with friends who have same-sex parents ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classmates who have same-sex parents , and this is a tough one . If the child wants to know what the Bible says about homosexuality , I would teach my child to point him or her to Scripture and explain it . But generally , that 's not the question that kids are asking . <p> Children should never be ostracized or punished for the lifestyle choices their parents have made . They want to know that they are loved and accepted even though their family is different . They want to know that God has a plan for their life . They need to know that God must punish sin because he is a holy God , but his mercy and forgiveness extend from the east to the west . They simply need a friend . <p> TN : I 'd want my kids to be honest . I do n't  want them to feel they need to hide their Christianity . With that said , I would want them to be wise and discerning . I want them to learn to share an opinion , concern or conviction when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmate is sharing , I might teach my children to start responding by asking their classmate questions instead of throwing out accusations . Its the childs parents who are same-sex partners . The child should n't be shunned because of the choice of the parents . Ultimately , I want my kids to be gospel-minded . I pray they would remember the truth of the gospel as they learn to relate to others and would have boldness to lovingly share when and where possible . <p> SG : Kids should first learn how to share their faith and to share the essence of the gospel in the middle of their relationships before they are taught , or even encouraged , to address sin or differences of beliefs . Addressing sin without first introducing Jesus never goes well ! <p> For many kids , the " experience " of their friends can cause them to question what they have been taught about biblical sexuality and traditional marriage , so it is important that parents walk with their kids through the Word and allow it to illuminate the situation . Make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kids and that the same-sex parents may well be very nice , caring and capable parents . If the issue arises specifically in conversation , teach your children how to state their beliefs carefully and with sensitivity , and teach them how to affirm their friendship and sincerely love their friends . <p> JS : Our kids are n't  always going to say the right things , and we need to be patient with them . Most importantly , its crucial for them to understand that behavior is the fruit of what 's in our hearts . It should surprise them less and less that people disobey Gods commands if they do n't  have Jesus in their heart . Our neighbors need to know Jesus before theyll want to obey his commands . As kids grow in their knowledge of the gospel and how God changes hearts , theyll better relate to their friends , family and neighbors . <p> This article was featured in our inaugural issue of Light Magazine .

@@100509272 @4709272/ <h> 5 ways to prevent ministry burnout <p> It was a busy day of ministry . Five thousand people covered the hillside where Jesus taught , not including women and children . Evening was coming on fast , and the people were hungry . So Jesus fed them food from a boys lunch of two small fish and five loaves of bread . Scripture tells us that , " after he had dismissed the crowds , he went up on the mountain by himself to pray . When evening came , he was there alone " ( Matt. 14:23 ) . <p> Ministry and burnout <p> The demands of ministry havent changed much in the last two thousand years . Ministry remains a 24/7 job . That 's because crises do n't  fit neatly into a 9 to 5 schedule . The needs of church members are constant . Indeed , many happen in the middle of the night or when the pastor is on vacation with his family . The life of ministry can be draining and demanding , leaving little time for rest and refreshment . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of ministry . People expect ministry leaders to know the answer to every question , fix every marriage and engage every lost soul . And they want pastors to prepare a challenging , yet not too convicting sermon each and every week . The church budget is always stretched thin , and the needs only continue to grow . Someone is always dissatisfied with the songs chosen for worship and , of course , an announcement was left out of last weeks church bulletin . Do n't  forget that there are never enough volunteers to serve in the nursery . <p> For those who work in full time ministry serving our local churches , such as pastors , leaders of church ministries , and counselors , burnout is a common problem . The pressures of ministry , combined with how many hours these leaders pour into their work , can lead many to feel hopeless , overwhelmed , discouraged , unmotivated , cynical , unproductive , and sometimes even depressed . Such burnout trickles over into their family life , creating tension and strife at home . Many statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as 1,700 a month , and often because of burnout . <p> Burnout prevention <p> As church members , we need to help and encourage our ministry leaders . We cant expect them to be superhuman . Here are a few things to consider about burnout prevention : <p> 1 . Ministry leaders need rest ( both physical and spiritual ) . As we saw in Matthew 14 , even our Savior had physical limitations in his humanity . His body grew tired . He needed time away from his work to rest and pray . Just as our Lord took time away from the work of ministry , ministry leaders need to do the same . We need to provide ways for them to do so . In America , we call it vacation . Americans are known for neglecting to use their vacation time . Those who work in ministry are no exception . We need to encourage them to take regular breaks and even sabbaticals . <p> 2 . Ministry leaders need friendships . It is hard for ministry leaders to have real , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are helping everyone else in the church with their problems . But those who serve us in ministry need deep friendships of their own . It is important that we encourage our ministry leaders to invest in friendships where they have the freedom to share common experiences , voice their struggles and burdens , and receive accountability . It may mean that they have to seek such friendships in other churches in the community . <p> 3 . Ministry leaders need help . It is important that ministry leaders and we , as church members , realize that ministry leaders cant do everything . They are not God . They are not all-knowing . They are not all-powerful . They ca n't be everywhere at once and meet the needs of every person who asks for their help . They are finite and human with limited energy and resources . This means that church members need to step in and help . Ephesians 4:12 tell us that the job of the pastor is to equip the saints for the work of ministry . It is the church members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of ministry . If every church member did their part , the weight of ministry would not fall onto one person . Let us reach out to our ministry leaders and offer our help . <p> 4 . Ministry leaders need realistic expectations . Ministry leaders need realistic expectations of themselves , and church members need to have realistic expectations for them . Ministry leaders often work more hours than any of us would be willing to . We need to carefully consider the demands and expectations we place on our church leaders , remembering that they are only human . This brings us back to number three . <p> 5 . Remember the needs of their family . We often forget the needs of our church leaders family . They usually receive what 's leftover at the end of the long day . They are the ones who suffer when the pastor works countless hours a week , is constantly criticized by church members , or when he is discouraged by conflict and tension in the church . Let us consider how we can help and encourage the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important calling . We need our church leaders . But the demands of church ministry are high . As church members , let us not knowingly contribute to the pressure , unrealistic expectations , and demands of ministry . Instead , may we help and encourage them for we are all members of the same Body , that is , Christ our Lord . 
@@100509273 @4709273/ <h> 5 ways to respond to recent violence <p> The cascading news stories of violence involving police have sent Americans from shock to grief and back through the terrible cycle multiple times this week . How should Christians respond ? Here are five ways to help guide our thinking : <p> 1 . Love . If you 're like me , the headlines have taken you on an emotional rollercoaster in the last 48 hours . Always choose to love . Always choose to forgive . <p> 2 . Seek unity . As members of the body of Christ , Christians should identify more as their new spiritual race than as their biological one . This is impossible without the power of the gospel working through faith in Christ . That ethnicity that you are tempted to blame : Jesus shed his blood for someone in that ethnicity . Strive for the unity that Christ has accomplished with his redemption . Let the church be the model of forgiveness and unity that society is lacking . Let your Christian unity in this hour be the story you pass down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . Do justice . Do what youre called to do as a citizen and pray ( 1 Timothy 2 ) for government to do what they are called to do as civil authority . Recognize that God has given the sword to the civil authorities to ensure justice . They need prayer . In a fallen age , human governments are riddled by human failure and human sin . Because vengeance is the Lords , and because He grants some limited authority to civil leaders for the sake of justice , unjust officials are to be held accountable by the government . <p> At the same time , Christians are commanded to respect and honor governing authorities ( Romans 13 , 1 Peter 2 ) . Every act of police injustice needs to be paid for under penalty of law , but do n't  hold good officers guilty until proven innocent . What peaceful citizen would wish upon their city the lack of a police force ? Through prayer and proper honor , seek justice by promoting good government . Because government is intended to be Gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good of their neighbors when they seek to promote good government . <p> 4 . Soberly recognize and mourn sins effects . These events remind us that we live in a cursed world . As we feel the effects of a fallen creation , we must view these events with sober-mindedness . Police injustice , mass murders - these are the results of humans being humans in a sinful age . Let us mourn the effects of a fallen world with those who mourn . Sin is tragic , and it is not Gods will . <p> 5 . Have hope . This city is not your city . You have a home with God where no police are needed and no punishment is given because Christ has paid for your every sin . Let the victory of the cross in your life compel you forward to courageously seek gospel transformation in your city today . In times such as these , God often uses the hope of Christians to powerfully shine into a culture in despair . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Yesterday evening I drove down to Dallas Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I drove back to Frisco , we talked in disbelief about the egregious and senseless taking of lives that we have seen in ...

How essential the family has been to the building of this country ! And how worthy it remains of our support and encouragement ! Yet I can not hide my concern for the family , which is threatened , perhaps as never before , from within and without . Fundamental relationships are being called into question , as is the very basis of marriage and the family . I can only reiterate the importance and , above all , the richness and the beauty of family life . <p> In particular , I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable , the young . For many of them , a future filled with countless possibilities beckons , yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless , trapped in a hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our problems . We can not avoid them . We need to face them together , to talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions . At the risk of oversimplifying , we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family , because they lack possibilities for the future . Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family . <p> Religion , Violence , and Freedom <p> Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict , hatred and brutal atrocities , committed even in the name of God and of religion . We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism . This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism , whether religious or of any other kind . A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion , an ideology or an economic system , while also safeguarding religious freedom , intellectual freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve todays many geopolitical and economic crises .

We must move forward together , as one , in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity , cooperating generously for the common good . <p> The Role of Religion in Society <p> In this land , the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society . It is important that today , as in the past , the voice of faith continue to be heard , for it is a voice of fraternity and love , which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society .

Politics is , instead , an expression of our compelling need to live as one , in order to build as one the greatest common good : that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share , in justice and peace , its goods , its interests , its social life . I do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves , but I encourage you in this effort . <p> Immigration <p> In recent centuries , millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom . We , the people of this continent , are not fearful of foreigners , because most of us were once foreigners . I say this to you as the son of immigrants , knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants . <p> Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others , rejecting a mindset of hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant effort to do our best . I am confident that we can do this . <p> The Refugee Crisis <p> Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War . This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions . On this continent , too , thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones , in search of greater opportunities . Is this not what we want for our own children ? We must not be taken aback by their numbers , but rather view them as persons , seeing their faces and listening to their stories , trying to respond as best we can to their situation . To respond in a way which is always humane , just and fraternal . We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays : to discard whatever proves troublesome . Let us remember the Golden Rule : " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you " ( Mt 7:12 ) . <p> The Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of my ministry , to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty .

Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty . Not only do I support them , but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation . <p> The Role of Wealth in Fighting Poverty <p> The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts , especially in its causes . I know that many Americans today , as in the past , are working to deal with this problem . <p> <p> It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth . The right use of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern , inclusive and sustainable .

This common good also includes the earth , a central theme of the encyclical which I recently wrote in order to " enter into dialogue with all people about our common home " ( ibid. , 3 ) . " We need a conversation which includes everyone , since the environmental challenge we are undergoing , and its human roots , concern and affect us all " ( ibid. , 14 ) . <p> The Environment <p> In Laudato Si , I call for a courageous and responsible effort to " redirect our steps " ( ibid. , 61 ) , and to avert the most serious effects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States and this Congress have an important role to play . <p> The Arms Trade <p> Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society ?

In the face of this shameful and culpable silence , it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade . <p> The Four Americans <p> I would like to mention four of these Americans : Abraham Lincoln , Martin Luther King , Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton . <p> <p> This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln , the guardian of liberty , who labored tirelessly that " this nation , under God , might have a new birth of freedom " .

@@100509278 @4709278/ <h> 7 practices to help heal your angry heart <p> If you have an anger problem , it could be that you are just too religious . <p> When Jesus said in Matthew 5 , " Your righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees and scribes , " he was not telling us to try harder . Jesus first concern is not what we do but who we are . He is more concerned with our heart than our behavior . The righteousness of the Pharisees and scribes never fixes the heart . It only legislates behavior , and whenever we try to mask our broken hearts with good behavior , we not only play the hypocrite , but we lose our ability to love God and love other people ; and we become angry . <p> Here is what Jesus said in Matthew 5:21-26 , <p> You have heard that it was said to our ancestors , Do not murder , and whoever murders will be subject to judgment . But I tell you , everyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be subject to the Sanhedrin . But whoever says , You moron ! will be subject to hellfire . So if you are offering your gift on the First go and be reconciled with your brother , and then come and offer your gift . Reach a settlement quickly with your adversary while you 're on the way with him , or your adversary will hand you over to the judge , the judge to the officer , and you will be thrown into prison . I assure you : You will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny ! <p> As Jesus quoted the Law , " Do not murder , " it is likely his hearers felt pretty good about themselves . They knew of a few murderers , but they were not murderers . So what did this have to do with them ? Then Jesus said , " But I tell you , everyone who is angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When sin has its way , hate replaces love and contempt replaces compassion . The first recorded act of sin outside of the Eden was a brother murdering his brother . There was no self-defense involved . It was not accidental . It was a crime against another human being , rooted in anger . So Jesus gets to the heart of the issue and said just as the murderer will be subject to judgment , so will the one who is angry with his brother . <p> But Paul indicates that not all anger is wrong by writing , " Be angry , and do not sin " ( Eph. 4:26 ) . Jesus showed indignation toward the religious leaders on a number of occasions . So Jesus was not condemning anger toward injustice . Neither was he talking about the anger of personal frustration . Instead , he was condemning a selfish anger , rooted in pride , jealousy , unforgiveness and bitterness toward the people around us . He was confronting our unwillingness to love one another . Jesus goal here was not to reduce crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts . <p> Our lack of love shows itself in a number of ways , but it is most quickly revealed in our speech . Jesus called out the word " raca . " Some translations use the word " fool , " but it could also be translated , " air head , " " jerk , " or " worthless . " It was a well-known word of contempt , which even sounded rough when spoken . It was intended to mark another person as one with no value . Jesus went further and said , " Whoever says , You moron ! will be subject to hellfire . " Raca impugns a persons worth , but " moron " shows disregard for a persons character . You have to face the religious tribunal ( the Sanhedrin ) for " raca , " but " moron " will land you in hell . Jesus was very serious about this and our lack of love for one another . <p> He was so serious that he said we can not relate to God with any kind of authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jews would bring their gifts on the Day of Atonement to offer as a sacrifice . It was a big deal that only happened once every year . It was a real sacrifice that required planning and travel . Their righteousness , so they thought , depended on it . But Jesus said , do n't  bring your gift until you have reached out for reconciliation with your brother . Our problem with another person is not just between two people . People problems are an offense against God . <p> It could be that our worship is so dry ; it could be that our prayers are empty ; it could be that our appetite for Gods Word is so small ; it could be that our service is fruitless because of our attitudes of pride , jealousy , unforgiveness and bitterness toward the people around us . <p> So Jesus said to take care of the conflict before it goes to the judge .

Here are seven practices of reconciliation that can bring healing to our angry hearts . <p> Humble yourself . Just because we have not killed someone yet , does not mean we are without guilt . When we are offended , our pain is legitimate . But when we have been offended , it is also very likely our brokenness has affected the offender in ways we know nothing about . The other person may be just as hurt as we are . We may or may not deserve the treatment we are getting , but we all deserve much worse than we are getting . The log in our own eye is there , and until we acknowledge it and deal with it , we will have a difficult time reconciling with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show honor . The terms " raca " and " moron " were bad words that revealed a bad attitude . Paul wrote , " Show family affection to one another with brotherly love . Outdo one another in showing honor " ( Rom. 12:10 ) . Affection and honor are signs of respect . They are not only attitudes ; they are actions . Jesus demonstrated his love for us . We did not deserve it , but he showed it by giving his life . We do not endorse offensive behavior ; but by giving our time and effort to others , we show honor to them as people who have value as image bearers of God . <p> Guard speech . Jesus flat out condemned calling people names or speaking of one another in negative ways . Maybe you have noticed , but we often feel justified to offend whenever we have been offended . Our negative speech often validates our negative attitudes , but biblical Christianity calls us to something better than that . " Kind words are like honey sweet to the soul and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech should be pleasant to the ears and to the soul of those who hear , and even to those who do not hear us right away . <p> Take initiative . Jesus said , " Go and be reconciled . " If you know there is something between you and another person , step forward and show concern and a willingness to reconcile .

We consider it paid , although it is not , and we " absorb the liability someone else deserves to pay . " When we forgive , we do not dwell on the offense , we do not bring it up or use it against them , we do not talk about it to others , and we do not allow the offense to stand between us .

God is also very capable of healing what has been lost . Sometimes restoration is possible . Other times it may be out of reach . But either way we can rest in the sovereign hands of God . <p> Paul wrote , " But If your enemy is hungry , feed him . If he is thirsty , give him something to drink . For in so doing you will be heaping fiery coals on his head . Do not be conquered by evil , but conquer evil with good " ( Rom. 12:20-21 ) .

During the month of March 1965 , civil rights leaders led three protest marches that were pivotal in advancing the rights of black Americans . Here are five sets of facts you should know about these historic marches : <p> 1 . Segregation in America officially ended with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . Yet in some Southern states measures were still being taken to obstruct black Americans from registering to vote . During the same month as the passage of the civil rights legislation , an Alabama judge issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under sponsorship of numerous civil rights groups . This order shut down efforts to oppose disenfranchisement in the state for the remainder of 1964 . <p> 2 . During the first few months of 1965 , several groups and civil rights leaders , including Martin Luther King , Jr . broke the injunction and lead marches in Selma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white segregationists attacked a group of peaceful demonstrators in the nearby town of Marion . In the ensuing chaos , an Alabama state trooper fatally shot Jimmie Lee Jackson , a civil rights activist and Baptist deacon . Civil rights groups organized a march for March 7 from Selma to Montgomery to demand justice for the murder of Jackson and to confront Governor Wallace over voting rights . In response , Wallace issues a declaration forbidding the protest and orders the state troopers to " Use whatever measures are necessary to prevent a march . " <p> 3 . After Sunday morning church services on March 7 , approximately 600 demonstrators headed east out of Selma on U.S. Highway 80 . When they came to Edmund Pettus Bridge , just outside the city , state troopers confronted them . The police shot tear gas into the crowd and began using their clubs to beat the protestors . By the end of the day , which will become known as " Bloody Sunday " , 100 of the 600 marchers required medical attention for fractured skulls , broken teeth and limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broadcast on national television , causing Americans across the country to be dismayed by the police violence . Numerous civil rights and religious leaders of all faiths traveled to Selma to join the protest . <p> 4 . On Tuesday , March 9 , King leads another march of 3,000 protestors . When they reach the bridge this time they are met by 500 state troopers . As the marchers near , the troopers open their ranks , seemingly to allow the protestors to continue on . King realizes that continuing will incite the police to more violence , so he had the marchers turn around and returned back to their rally point at Brown Chapel . <p> 5 . The injunction against the protestors is lifted on March 17 by a federal judge , with the backing and support of President Lyndon Johnson . The president then federalized the Alabama National Guard and sent 1,000 military policemen and 2,000 army troops to escort the march from Selma .

" Indeed , Plaintiffs have presented reams of internal government documents demonstrating that the predominant purpose of the rule was to stamp out the right to refuse for religious reasons .

@@100509283 @4709283/ <h> Fighting drug resistance to the glory of God <p> Midway through the last century , a prominent scientist named F.M . Burnet stated : " If one looks around the medical scene in North America or Australia , the most important current change he sees is the rapidly diminishing importance of infectious diseases . . . . With full use of the knowledge we already possess , the effective control of every important infectious disease . . . is possible . " <p> On the contrary , the wholesale control of infectious diseasesonce presumed to be just around the cornerhas yet to materialize . To be sure , remarkable progress has been made in our understanding , prevention and management of infections in the years since Dr. Burnets unrealized prediction . Advances in sanitation , hygiene , nutrition , diagnostic capabilities , antimicrobial therapies and immunization programs ( to name but a few ) have reshaped the world we live in and saved countless lives . But the assumption that civilization will one day marshal these medical resources to once-and-for-all regain an Edenic dominion over the whole realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Even as medical advancements are made and old foes are put in check , new challenges continue to arise . <p> Take for instance the concerning trend of antibiotic resistance1 . The advent of affordable and effective antibiotics during the previous century was a major boon and understandably led to a high confidence in the medical community . But almost as soon as widespread use of these wonderdrugs began , reports of infections caused by resistant bacteria began to emerge . The incidence and clinical significance of antibiotic resistance have risen sharply ever since . <p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that two million people per year in the United States have serious illnesses due to drug-resistant bacteria , with nearly 23,000 deaths annually . Global surveillance has shown a steady trend of emerging antibiotic resistance , with new types of resistance to last-resort drugs appearing and spreading predictably . A recent report of a patient in Pennsylvania with a bacterial infection harboring a specific type of resistance not previously seen in the United Statesthe presence of the mcr-1 gene in E. coli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called colistinhas raised further concern . Many media outlets erroneously reported that the patients infection was resistant to all known antibiotics , but the difficult reality remains that the discovery of this new resistance mechanism ( the last puzzle piece , so to speak ) means that such pan-resistant infections are right around the corner . <p> Its important to understand that these ever-encroaching public health threats have not come out of left field . This is the trajectory we have been on for quite some time . The emergence of resistance is a simple matter of natural adaptation for any bacteria exposed to the selective pressure of antibiotics . Even as an antibiotic is mowing down infectious pathogens ( along with a host of innocent bystanders ) , small populations of bacteria seek to survive and adapt . If someone were trying to kill you , youd try to squirm out of it too . In a sense , this is all that antibiotic resistance isbacteria figuring out how to dodge or block the bullets being sent their way . <p> But just because its a natural process does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inappropriate use of antibiotics fuels the engine that drives resistance and increases the number of difficult-to-treat infections . Common examples of inappropriate antibiotic use include taking antibiotics when they are not indicated ( e.g. , when you have a viral illness ) , treating bacterial infections with antibiotics that have an unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity ( using a shotgun approach when you need the sharpshooter ) , and the overuse of antibiotics in food-producing animals . <p> Healthcare providers often talk about judicious use of antibiotics , though we are admittedly better at talking about it than practicing it . Even so , an encouraging emphasis has been placed on antibiotic stewardship , which is a commitment to use antibiotics appropriately and responsibly . In addition to getting healthcare providers committed to this , good stewardship also involves educating the community so that their expectations are well informed and they 're not tempted to pressure providers into bad prescribing practices . <p> The concept of stewardship brings us back to Eden .

As God has intended from the beginning , we are called to be good stewards of the resources he provides . He put us here and told us to care for his creation , to toil and tend it , to thrive and flourish with it . If we do not live up to this calling , there are real consequences we must deal with . Most of us can see the sense in this when it comes to environmental resources , such as a rainforest , but it applies to his gifts of common grace as well . Inasmuch as it plays a role in helping human society thrive , medicine should be seen as a gift from God , a common grace which at times can offer a temporal restraint on sickness , suffering , and even death . Appropriate and responsible use of the medical resources God has put within our reach is a matter of good stewardship . If we abuse these gifts , we threaten our own well-being . <p> If we think of ourselves as conquerors of Gods creation rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overreaching use of the good gifts he provides .

As a starting point , here are three simple changes we all can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  scare pregnant women . Give them courage instead . Most women who seek abortions seek them because they are afraid . Sometimes that fear comes from us . I serve a conservative Southern Baptist church in one of the reddest counties of one of the reddest states in the nation . Nevertheless , I 've counseled pregnant teens who have told me , " Members of your church have told me that having this baby will ruin my life and have suggested that I should just get an abortion . " Nothing I 've ever heard has so broken my heart as that . Both as a pastor and as an adoptive father Ive seen the way that boyfriends , family members , friends , and in one case , even a hospital janitor can bully and ostracize young women who want to do the right thing for their babies . Who is going to stand by these young women and give them courage ? Why not us ? <p> One great way to give them courage is to minister to them by meeting their needs . If their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to live . If they ca n't or wont raise the baby , make adoption an easier choice for them . Help them to know for certain that choosing life will not ruin their lives , because they wont face the future alone . I 'm so thankful to know that , even if there have sometimes been members of my church in the shadows scaring pregnant women , my church has a lot of members in it who have been ministering in the ways that I have mentioned and in even more ways than those . Let 's all stand together to give courage to young women who are trying to do the right thing . <p> Second , prioritize the cause of life . Judge the character of politicians based upon the stance they take with regard to abortion . Unfortunately , both parties have nominated candidates for President who have not demonstrated a commitment to the dignity of unborn human life . How do we face this decision ? Because evangelical Christians decided that the pro-life cause is not that important . It was more important to them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a statement than making a difference . I submit to you that if boorishness is a higher priority than saving the lives of babies , then saving the lives of babies is not really that high of a priority to us after all . <p> We can do better . Our priorities are shown in what we are willing to compromise in order to build coalitions . We can build pro-life coalitions with people who may disagree with us on some economic policies or other social policies . Instead we build coalitions with people who agree with us about fiscal conservatism but disagree with us about life . That 's all you need to know about where our priorities have really lain . I believe that is the wrong set of priorities , and so long as we approach the pro-life cause in this way , well continue to get presidential choices like the one we face this year and court decisions like Whole Womans Health v Hellerstedt . <p> Finally , champion the champions of life .

" Honor your father and your mother , that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you " ( Exod. 20:12 ) . For me , the call to honor my father meant moving him to be near me . For you it may mean something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength that I need to trust God and say " yes " to him . <p> Remember where you 've set your hope . The day my father signed the lease for his new home and the finality of this decision set in , I started losing sleep . Three nights into my insomnia , I got up in the dark of the night and went into the living room . With my forehead on the floorthe posture of my best prayingI began pouring out all of my fear to God , calling each one by name . After that , I named all the things I knew about God from the Bible and my own experience . I called out in whispered tones the stories of Gods faithfulness to me . I remembered how he had carried me through troubled waters many times before . I thanked him for his steadfast love for me . As I turned my inward gaze on my sovereign God , my spirit remembered how very little of my fathers well-being actually depended on me . Peace welled up from somewhere deep inside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night . My hope was not in myself ; it was fixed and firm in the God who made the universe ( Ps. 78:6-7 ) . <p> Pray continually . " Rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , be constant in prayer " ( Rom. 12:12 ) . As I am caring for my father , I am asking God for every single thing we need : a buyer for his house , compassionate and competent new doctors who will accept his insurance , help with his veterans benefits , wisdom to navigate the various government agencies who administer his retirement pay and on and on and on . Every answered prayer is a wonder of God , an opportunity to tell of his wonderful works in my familys story . <p> Follow the example of your and my burden is light " ( Matt. 11:28-30 ) . Think of the beauty of Jesuss words in the context of caring for a parent . Jesus sets the example of humble service and invites us to join him . As we are serving our parents , giving rest to them in the humble ways we can , our kind and humble Savior promises us rest for our very souls . What a sweet invitation he offers . <p> I have lived the last 20 years many miles from my father ; now I live less than 10 minutes from him . God has given our family a sweet opportunity to enjoy my father in these yearsto hear his stories , to learn from his experience , and to help bring him much needed joy and community . <p> The way we honor our parents now matters tremendously , both to the generation that came before us and the ones that are following after . May the Lord Jesus be exalted and glorified through us as we honor him in this beautiful and vital way . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

For nearly a decade , I have called this place home . Three of my four children are native-born Texans . While every city has its warts , I have thoroughly enjoyed the slow-paced , down-to-earth culture of the place where the West begins . <p> However , in recent days there have been developments within our little slice of Texan paradise that have made me wonder if I am living in New York , Los Angeles or ( gasp ) Dallas . Just last week , news headlines started appearing that the Fort Worth Independent School District had enacted new guidelines regarding transgender students and bathroom/locker room use . Such guidelines never appeared on a FWISD meeting agenda , nor did the school board seek public comment . The new guidelines seem to be the work of Superintendent Kent Scribner . Earlier this week Lt. Governor Dan Patrick called on Superintendent Scribner to resign . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target has recently touted in its bathroom policies . There are also provisions related to private bathroom facilities , athletic teams , and school counselors . In essence , FWISD schools are now to allow students to use whichever restroom matches the gender with which they currently identify . Students may play on athletic teams of the gender with which they identify unless that sport is regulated by the University Interscholastic League ( UIL ) , which states that student athletes can only play on gender-specific teams according to the gender listed on the students birth certificate . <p> There is also a significant statement in the section entitled " Privacy and Confidentiality . " In this section , the guidelines read : <p> All students have a right to privacy . This includes keeping a students actual or perceived gender identity and expression private . School personnel may only share this information on a need-to-know basis or as the student directs . This includes sharing information with the students parent or guardian . When contacting the parent or guardian of a transgender student , school personnel must use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender assigned at birth unless the student , parent , or guardian has specified otherwise . <p> I sent the following letter to my specific FWISD board representative , as well as the board president , first vice president and second vice president . Even though there are many different approaches for addressing an issue like this , I have focused on the parental rights angle . I hope you find this letter helpful . <p> Dear School Board Member ( specific names used in actual letters ) : <p> As a resident in FWISD District 6 and a parent of 4 children , I am greatly troubled by the new transgender student guidelines . Without any opportunity for public comment nor any opportunity for constituents to contact their school board members , FWISD has enacted politically-motivated , controversial , and potentially damaging policies . Of particular concern is the section of the guidelines that notes the following : <p> " All students have a right to privacy . This includes keeping a students actual or perceived gender identity and expression private . School personnel may only share this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This includes sharing information with the students parent or guardian . " <p> I have four school-age children . Their well-being and livelihood is the responsibility of my wife and myself . No government agency , school employee , or educator has the right to usurp my authority as a parent . Parents should always be informed of issues that happen at school . The school should never intentionally withhold information from parents . This is government overreach at a most egregious level . <p> For this reason , I respectfully ask you to call for the school board to rescind these new guidelines immediately . At the very least , the entire school board should suspend the guidelines , take up this issue with great caution , and receive input from the constituents whom they represent . Action like this on the part of the school board contributes to a culture of distrust for the school board on the part of Fort Worths residents . <p> Thank you for your time and service to our community .

@@100509292 @4709292/ <h> 6 ways pastors can equip churches to engage cultural issues <p> This word , from our pastors , is what we want to hear on Sunday . We do n't  want our weekly gatherings to be a political party rally . We do n't  want our small groups to sound like a panel on Meet the Press . We do n't  want every conversation in the church foyer to center on delegate counts , swing districts and multi-colored maps of the U.S. <p> When we come to church , we want to worship the King of kings , we want to feast on food from the Word of God , and we want join in prayer with our brothers and sisters in Christ . <p> But , I wonder if we have failed to equip ourselves to engage the world because of our desire to keep church apolitical in order to avoid the kind of patriotic syncretism of a previous generation . <p> Piety without purpose <p> Thankfully , there is a discipleship revolution in evangelicalism . Its what our leaderspastors , denominational voices , scholarsare emphasizing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems models of spiritual formation only involve the essential acts of pietyBible reading , prayer , evangelism , personal integrity and human relationshipwith little or no teaching on how to engage cultural issues . Where are the resources to help the follower of Christ understand how to steward his earthly citizenship well ? <p> This might explain why the definition of " evangelical " is undergoing more stress than perhaps any time in the history of the movement . On the one hand , the shift in marriage norms have left many evangelicals flat-footed , either agreeing with but unable to articulate a biblical view of marriage , or capitulating to the culture with hackneyed exegesis of Scripture . On the other hand , the rise of secular nationalism and Darwinian populism has captured the support of some evangelicals flocking to leaders who make hollow promises to restore American greatness . <p> There are myriad reasons for this confusion . But , perhaps the biggest reason many evangelicals seem unable to do cultural engagement well is a resistance on the part of pastors and church leaders to fully equip their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have we failed to give our people the theological tools to think deeply about pressing public issues ? <p> Pastors are called as shepherds , obeying Jesus commandment to " teach them all I 've commanded you " ( Matt. 28:20 ) . Gods people cant rightly love their neighbors , cant seek human flourishing and cant pursue justice if they do n't  have a biblical framework with which to understand their world . Thabiti Anyabwile says it well : " Preaching something political is necessary if we are to live under Christs lordship in every area of life . Not doing so means Fox , CNN , MSNBC and other secular news outlets disciple us instead . I fear that 's been the case far too long and to disastrous effect for the church and the country . " <p> By not " doing politics " many are actually doing politics , offering subtle affirmation , by their silence , to the cultures reigning orthodoxies . In other words , you cant escape the culture wars , even if you tried . <p> Many pastors might read this and chafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They recoil at the tactics of a previous generation that seemed too closely aligned with a political party . But there is a way to help the church engage cultural issues like marriage , race , immigration , poverty and abortion from a gospel-centered perspective without offering up God and country nationalism . <p> If we believe Christ is Lord over all , we need to not only teach people to engage the spiritual disciplines like Bible-reading , prayer and evangelism , we need to teach them how to engage the world outside their prayer closets . <p> When pastors fail to equip their people to think biblically about issues , they cede authority to the high priests of culture : the talk show hosts , cable news hosts and online opinion-makers . People will go somewhere to have their consciences formed . Why isnt the church their first choice ? <p> By refusing to cover difficult cultural topics , as they come up in the preaching , through teaching forums , small group curriculum and by resourcing through discipleship , church leaders communicate a subtle dualism , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has no effect on Mondays voting , citizenship and opinion-making . <p> Our discipleship models , curriculums and systems need to include both orthodoxy and orthopraxy , piety and practice , personal integrity and public engagement . We do n't  need pastors to become party apparatchiks and church lobbies to be campaign offices . What we do need is to recover on Sunday , and in other formats , the opportunity for believers to be equipped to steward their citizenship well and engage their world with the gospel . Where else , beside the blood-bought community of faith , would we want Gods people to go to understand how the gospel applies to their world ? <p> After all , the gospel of the kingdom is not some tidy piety , reserved for Hallmark cards and Christian calendars . It is an inherently political statement . When Jesus declared himself to be King , he was saying to his people and to the world that the man in Rome was not the ultimate sovereign of the world , that the powers that be rule at the discretion of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . <p> What does this look like ? <p> So the obvious questions for many pastors is this : What does this look like in the context of a local church ? How can a pastor equip his people to address cultural issues with a biblical perspective ? Every pastor knows his church best , but here are a few thoughts : <p> Lay gospel foundations . Your best work is in consistently preaching and teaching the Scriptures from a Christ-centered perspective . Teach faithfully through books of the Bible and give your people a steady diet of preaching over a long period of time . <p> Do n't  skip hard issues . When cultural issues arise from the text ( and they will ) , do n't  skip over them because they may offend the sensibilities of your people . Declare what God has said , and let the Spirit work in the hearts of your people . <p> Make specific , real-world application . Always be thinking of how the truth in the passage will not only confirm what your people already profess to believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change thinking that has been formed by cultural trends . I have a more in-depth article here on how to do this well in preaching . <p> Find creative ways to inform in forums other than Sunday morning . When I pastored , I did a Sunday evening series of talks on key cultural issues . I 've seen other pastors do this as well . Perhaps you might bring in an expert and engage in some question-and-answer time . <p> Promote good resources from organizations that have a biblical worldview . Always be suggesting good books , small group resources and other gospel-centered resources that can help more closely align thinking with the Bible . Be careful here , though , to be a good curator and ensure the content is actually gospel-centered . Do this both in one-on-one conversations and other public opportunities . <p> Stay equipped as a leader . You ca n't be an expert on every cultural issue . But you can , by intentional reading and study , be knowledgeable on certain pressing issues . Use trusted resources , attend relevant conferences ( like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books to study up . The job of a pastor is to shepherd and a shepherd must be skilled at caring for and feeding his flock . <p> How churches shepherd their people through cultural conflicts will differ , depending on context and church culture . What is important , however , is that leaders not abandon this important part of their calling . We must love our people enough to intentionally equip them to live on mission for Christ in this world . 43169 @qwx903169 43177 @qwx903177 43180 @qwx903180 43186 @qwx903186

Its a scandal that we make celebrities out of terrorists and psychopaths ) brutally murdered nearly 50 people in an Orlando nightclub , I and many of those close to me have had much to think about . The nightclub was a gay nightclub . The killer obviously targeted a specific community of human beings that particularly offended him , one that he wanted to terrorize . In the era of our media-soaked , clicks-oriented identity politics , the weight of that thought can be hard to feel .

That 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow of anotherwhat the Bible calls " bearing one anothers burdens " is a moral , emotional , intellectual , and interpersonal discipline . It must be practiced .

Federal investigators were still among the bodies of victims inside the Pulse nightclub when online pundits started to eviscerate the " silence " of Christians and other religious traditionalists .

Does it sound like the response of those who are grieving in a centered , emotionally mature way ? Or does it sound more like what we would expect of a generation that does n't  feel anything until its been siphoned through an online server and processed into pixels ? <p> The danger of the internet has always been the temptation to live life through it , one orbit short of the uncomfortable , offensive , difficult realities of real , flesh-and-blood existence . Social media offers as convincing a replication of actual community as human brains have invented thus far . Many of us carry our community in our pocket , in a smart phone whose soft blue glow has rewired neural pathways and made us anxious and listless when were not logged in . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good many people seem to think that our online identities are crucial extensions of our moral selvesso crucial , in fact , that whether or not a person is compassionate or caring can be evaluated by a quick glance at their pages .

Those are the scales of online justice , and they are absolute and unyielding . <p> But the greater sadness in all this is not what happens to those who are actually praying or meditating or grief counseling , while others are tweeting .

@@100509297 @4709297/ <p> On Friday , May 13 , the Obama administration sent a letter to all public schools in America notifying teachers and administrators of the regulations they must comply with in regards to their students " gender identity . " <p> The letter states that , to comply with Federal law , policies concerning students must be based on their gender identity and not on their biological sex . <p> By what authority is the Obama administration issuing this directive ? <p> Although Congress is responsible for creating laws , they have ceded much of their authority to define what laws mean to the other two branches of government . <p> We often think the judiciary is the branch of government responsible for interpreting the law . But in reality most interpretation is done by the executive branch , whose departments act as regulatory agencies . Regulatory agencies handle administrative law , primarily by codifying and enforcing rules and regulations . When Congress passes a new law it usually goes to a regulatory agency to determine how the law will be put in place . <p> This specific letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument that provides " initial interpretations of statutory and regulatory requirements and changes in interpretation or policy . " These type of directives are often used to " Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates , the Presidents priorities , or the principles " This letter provides guidance on how the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) and the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) will " evaluate a schools compliance " with interpretation of laws regarding transgender students . <p> What law is being changed or interpreted by this letter ? <p> This letter provides guidance on the Obama administrations interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs receiving Federal financial assistance . The administration has reinterpreted Title IX to make " gender identity " synonymous with " sex . " <p> The key sentence in the letter is " The Departments ED and DOJ treat a students gender identity as the students sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations . " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " identifies " as the opposite sex , then for almost all purposes public schools and colleges much treat them as such . <p> What are the potential penalties for refusing to follow this directive ? <p> School districts who do not comply would be considered by the Obama administration to be in violation of Title IX , and could lose Federal funds for their school(s) . <p> What exactly does " transgender " mean ? <p> The letter says that , " Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth . " <p> More broadly , transgenderism is an umbrella term for the state or condition of identifying or expressing a gender identity that does not match a person 's physical/genetic sex . A person can be transgender and " identify " as male , female , " third sex " , " genderfluid " ( flexible about their gender identity and fluctuating between genders ) , " genderqueer " ( not exclusively masculine or feminine ? ) , or dozens of variations . <p> Transgender is independent of sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be heterosexual , homosexual , bisexual , pansexual , polysexual , or asexual . <p> What is " gender identity " ? <p> As the letter defines the term , " Gender identity refers to an individuals internal sense of gender . A persons gender identity may be different from or the same as the persons sex assigned at birth . " <p> The LGBTQ community and their allies ( including the Obama administration ) consider gender to be a trait that exists along a continuum and is not inherently rooted in biology or physical expressions . <p> How does a student prove they are transgender ? <p> They do n't  have to prove anything ; all that is required is for the student or students parent to notify the school . As the letter states , " Under Title IX , there is no medical diagnosis or treatment requirement that students must meet as a prerequisite to being treated consistent with their gender identity .

" Choosing ones gender identity is now considered a protected civil right by the Obama administration . As the notes , that means , " As is consistently recognized in civil rights cases , the desire to accommodate others discomfort can not justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students . " <p> Must schools now call male students " she " and female students " he " ? <p> Yes .

They can not require them to use facilities based on their biological sex or use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so . <p> How does this directive affect athletics ? <p> The regulation is vague on this point . In general , if a biologically male transgender student wants to play the girls team they must be allowed to do so . However , the letter also says , " Title IX does not prohibit age-appropriate , tailored requirements based on sound , current , and research-based medical knowledge about the impact of the students participation on the competitive fairness or physical safety of the sport .

@@100509299 @4709299/ <h> 5 reasons to rethink long engagements <p> In todays culture , many couples choose to have lengthy engagements , using the extra time for wedding planning , financial planning and relationship building . Though these are important aspects of the engagement period and though every engaged couple has differing circumstances , I 'm wondering if its time for us to rethink the idea of long engagements . I 'm extremely grateful for godly mentors in my life who helped me think through this all-too-common practice . Faithful Christians might disagree on this , but I think there are four reasons to rethink a long engagement : <p> 1 . Once there 's a ring on it , temptations intensify . <p> Ask any Christian married couple how daunting their engagement period was . You would be hard pressed to find a couple who would recommend a long engagement . Many of those whose engagement was long would not encourage it . Engagement is a special and fun season , but waiting much longer than six months will be miserable for you and your fiance . <p> One of the greatest joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift from God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage . Sex unites you to your partner . Until you put that ring on , you truly have no clue the power of the temptations ahead . Long engagements compound the difficulty of escalating temptation . The pressure , from the Enemy , from your own natural desires , and from the culture can overwhelm you and your fiance in extraordinary ways . Unnecessarily long engagements only increase the likelihood of yielding to sexual sin . <p> 2 . You are n't  as strong as you think you are . <p> As Satan begins to attack you during this phase , even the most righteous can fall . Most often , we are the first to believe in ourselves and oftentimes to a fault . Do not fall into the temptation of pride , assuming sheer willpower will get you through a lengthy engagement without sexual temptation playing a major factor . One of Satans best weapons is his ability to deceive , and once he deceives , he accuses , bringing about guilt , shame and hopelessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When entering this phase of life , you will need someone who has waded the waters that you will be entering ; someone that can hold you accountable and help you and your fiance navigate through the engagement period . <p> 3 . Purity prior to the engagement does not guarantee purity after the engagement . <p> I recently had a conversation with a college sophomore who was recently engaged and was planning a two-year engagement . I cringed as he talked about how they had been successfully pure throughout their lengthy dating relationship and as he naively assumed the two-year engagement would be a piece of cake . I wish I had taken that opportunity to challenge him on his assumptions . I would walk him through the previous two points and share with him how hard a mere five-and-a-half months was for me and my wife . I can not begin to fathom how treacherous the next couple years will be for the two of them as they continue to seek purity . I hope and pray that the Lord blesses them with that accomplishment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of outside help . <p> 4 . If you 're putting a ring on it , then you should be ready for the wedding bells . <p> From a kingdom perspective , one that subverts worldliness , purity matters more than planning . Planning is a virtue ( do n't  get me wrong ) , but when elevated above holiness , it becomes a vice . There are no hard and fast rules for Christians regarding the length of an engagement period . However , if you are not in a place to get married within a short period of time , you 'd be wise to reconsider whether or not you are ready to enter that phase of life . You can not be overly cautious when entering into the engagement period . This does not mean waiting for the perfect job , making the right amount of money and having the right house in the right neighborhood . Its unlikely that will happen . No one is ever perfectly prepared for all the challenges that come with marriage . Once you think you 've arrived , something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be longing for something bigger and better . You do not have to be rich to get married . <p> Neither my wife or myself had full-time , well paying jobs when we got engaged . She was still in school ( and still is ) , and I was working part-time as a College-Age Minister . By doing it this way , we knew that we were going to be forced to rely on the Lord to provide for us , and it turned out far better than relying on our own power . Had we waited until all of our " ducks were in a row , " we would not have been so aware of how the Lord provided for us . We now have an amazing story of Gods faithfulness in our lives , and I can not think of a better way to begin a marriage than by relying so strongly on the One who provides . <p> 5 . Engagement increases the tension between couples . <p> Regardless of the length of your engagement , tensions build once you begin this phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " everything is wonderful " phase of your relationship , with its dreaming and dating and few worries , into the pressurized season of wedding planning , financial considerations and the stress of wedding two lives into one . This is the " already , but not yet " phase of relationships . So many things , beyond sex , await you in covenant marriage , but you are unable to take part until the two of you have committed your lives to one another before God and the church . While it may be appealing to have a year to two-year-long engagement , you are only lengthening the inevitable tension that comes with it . Marriage allows you to begin to work out the inevitable relational conflicts as one flesh . <p> As you think about your future engagement , I hope you will use this as thought-provoking material to drive a healthy conversation with your significant other and those around you . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Lonliness happens , but when it comes , what things should we do to help others through their time of need ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives that would help us to share healthy relationships with those around ...

@@100509301 @4709301/ <h> 3 principles for talking politics on social media <p> The election season is in full swing , and there 's no way to avoid the Facebook post from the friend who swears they " never " talk politics , or the Twitter " rant " from the coworker that you did n't  even think watched the news . With the sheer insanity of our current election season , social media is not a good place to get away from politics . <p> Many of us struggle to know how to engage in conversations about these important topics on social media because opinions and emotions run high . These conversations often the run the risk of dehumanizing the people we are talking to , since we really are n't  saying these things to someones face , just their profile picture . Consequently , we can find it easy to get sucked into the hyperbole , the accusations and the sense of personal offense that often characterize political conversations on social media . <p> But it matters how we talk about these issues online . We can either point people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of our own flesh with our words . James warning that the tongue is a fire that can do catastrophic damage ( James 3:6 ) is not less true on Facebook than it is in the living room . <p> Here are three principles to remember that will help you as you talk about contentious political issues with friends and family online : <p> 1 . Listen <p> The biggest reason that conversations nosedive from helpful to hurtful is that people become unwilling to listen to the opposing point of view . When one or more participants decide to stop listening , the result is a gaggle of garrulous gabbers who just want their voice to be the loudest . At this point , defending your beliefs really just means defending your turf , and the discussion stops being about truth and becomes an extension of individual egos . <p> James 1:19 says that Christians ought to be quick to listen but slow to speak . For conversations that involve strongly held beliefs , like politics , the temptation is to enter a discussion determined to " prove " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't  know before . The best way to counteract this temptation is to follow the apostles command : Be slow to speak but quick to listen . Be eager to understand why someone may disagree with you , and what it is that may have lead them to a different conclusion . Instead of making assumptions , ask questions . This will not only help you be better able to represent the other persons beliefs fairly , but the process will almost always disarm tension and emotional heat from a controversial topic . <p> 2 . Be honest <p> The internet is a magnificent , world-changing tool , but it does lend itself to the propagation of false and often manipulative content . Christians seem particularly vulnerable to the scare mongering chain email , or even more embarrassingly , mistaking a piece of satire for actual reporting . As people who believe in absolute truth , Christians have to be the first in line to reject false rumors and innuendo , even when they seem to support " our side . " <p> As you engage in political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't true , and refuse the temptation to exaggerate so as to better prove your point . One of the biggest reasons Christians fall into this temptation on social media is that they want to sound like an expert on everything . But a 10 second Google search is not the same as being knowledgeable , and an unbridled desire to prove someone wrong can lead us into passing along false or incomplete information as if it is true . If you 're not actually sure how much the national debt has increased , find out before you comment on it . If you do n't  know that a particular politician said this or that , find out as best you can before you say so . Model honesty and humility , and the chances are , the people you talk to will do the same . <p> 3 . Do n't  take it personally <p> When someone disagrees with us , our natural tendency is to interpret it as a personal insult . We feel like we 've been rejected or ridiculed somehow . But in the majority of cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone actually said or did . It comes from the pride in our hearts . <p> Taking disagreement personally is usually a sign that we 've invested a sense of self-worth in our opinions . But this need not be . If your concern is for the truth of the gospel and the flourishing of your neighbor , then you will of course feel strongly about some issues , but your ego wont be at stake . If you find that someones differing opinion instinctively causes anger or defensiveness in you , the best thing you can do is to step back , temporarily back out of the exchange , and pray for your own heart and for the well-being of your neighbor . Resist the idea that your personal honor is at stake by the appearance of disagreement . <p> Generally , the people who are the best at not taking disagreement personally are the people who actively cultivate friendships with others not like them . This is one of the most glorious functions of the local churchto connect Christians who have nothing in common except the gospel . Pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and youll find defensiveness and ego slowly but surely evaporating. 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182

McGuire says that , " New information creates a rush of dopamine to the brain , a neurotransmitter that makes you feel good . The promise of new information compels your brain to seek out that dopamine rush . " Science testifies to an addictive tendency that many Western Christians struggle with , having hearts trained to be scrolling constantly through social media platforms , such as Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , looking for the next rush . <p> The question begs to be asked , " How can I appropriately steward my relationship with social media ?

The most important and largely unknown factor at this point is how the Supreme Courts Obergefell decision will affect religious liberty in the public square and also concerning private institutions . <p> Activists , lawmakers and judges have increasingly been reading " Sexual Orientation " and " Gender Identity " into protections against sex discrimination .

The importance of this can not be understated . From the sanctity of unborn life , to the protection of marriage and family , the economy , and war and peace , who Americans elect on November 8 , 2016 , will have incredible impact for the future trajectory of America .

A number of abortion providers in Texas challenged HB 2 , and this case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court to be heard early this year . <p> LGBT discrimination suits : Now that the Supreme Court has created a constitutional right for same-sex couples to be married , look for cases to start working their way up the system on these topics : ( 1 ) religious nonprofit hiring cases ; ( 2 ) wedding service provider cases ; ( 3 ) local , state , and federal tax exemption cases for organizations and churches that hold to a traditional view of marriage . <p> Racial reconciliation <p> 2015 was a difficult year for race relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garner to Tamir Rice to Laquan Mcdonald awakened the national conscience to systemic injustice in many American cities and the difficult challenges of the urban core . The tragedy in Charleston both offered a model for Christian forgiveness and provoked a discussion about the symbols that , to many , represent the inhumane institutions of Jim Crow and slavery . 2016 will undoubtedly continue to see stories that provoke national conversations on race . Here is hoping that the evangelical church will be the place where gospel-centered conversations can serve as a model for society and reflect , in some way , the diversity of the Kingdom of God ( Revelation 5,7 ) . <p> Terrorism and ISIS <p> 2015 saw fear grip the Western World as ISIS spread its murderous ideology across the Middle East , seizing large tracts of land and resources , and also initiated attacks in places like Paris and San Bernardino , California .

Will the Obama Administration and international community be able to advance policies that protect Christian populations that wish to stay in the Middle East and evacuate those that wish to leave ? This is a key issue to watch , especially early in 2016 . <p> The Syrian Civil War &amp; the Syrian refugee crisis <p> The main driver for the Syrian refugee crisis , the Syrian Civil War , will likely not end in 2016 , despite efforts among outside powers to broker peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , but refugees will begin fleeing again in the spring and summer .

May 2016 be a year that Christians stand with our Jewish neighbors <p> Sanctity of human life <p> In 2015 , Planned Parenthood was on the defensive , due to the courageous investigative work of The Center for Medical Progress .

To its credit , the administration forcefully declared that the Islamic State is guilty of genocide , the strongest word we have to describe the desecration of human dignity . <p> What is especially significant about the administrations declaration last week is that Christians were included in the declaration . There had been rumors for months that the administration was planning to declare that the Islamic State had committed genocide , but only against Yezidis . Secretary of State John Kerrys inclusion of Christians in the declaration is important and legitimizes the indescribable suffering that our brothers and sisters have faced in Iraq and Syria . <p> Defining genocide <p> Genocide is a term coined in the 1940s by Raphael Lemkin , and the term combines the Greek root genos with the Latin cide to mean the killing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term genocide is used to describe a program to completely exterminate a people , to wipe them out of existence . <p> There are a number of different legal definitions of genocide , but the most authoritative definition comes from the 1948 Geneva Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . Under the 1948 Geneva Convention , genocide is the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial , or religious group through any of the following acts : <p> ( a ) Killing members of the group ; <p> ( b ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members or in part ; <p> ( d ) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; <p> ( e ) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . <p> It is often difficult to prove that a genocide has been perpetrated , in part because the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Islamic State , however , has made its intentions very clear , such as when the organization lined up 21 Coptic Orthodox Christians on a beach in Libya , killing them only for being Christians . <p> The shame of failing to condemn <p> This marks only the second time since the passage of the 1948 Geneva Convention on genocide that the U.S. executive branch has invoked the word in the midst of the conflict . In 2004 , then-Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that a genocide was being committed against non-Arabs in the Darfur region of Sudan . The war in Darfur continues today , and the International Criminal Court has so far been unable to secure a conviction of genocide . <p> The U.S. did not , to our great shame , invoke the term " genocide " during the Rwandan genocide , which left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 dead . Indeed , in a now-infamous discussion paper , the legal team at the Department State specifically warned against making a declaration of genocide , because this might " commit the U.S. government to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the disastrous operation at the Battle of Mogadishu , the Clinton administration decided to stay out of the situation , letting the body count rack up rather than get involved . <p> That situation is not unlike the one the Obama administration faces today , and we applaud the Obama administration , despite the fact that the country is weary of and burned by lengthy engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan , was willing to do the right thing here . <p> Recognition comes with obligation <p> As President Obama says frequently , there are no good options in Syria and Iraq . This much is self-evident . <p> What is easy to miss in this discussion is that simply saying something really does matter to the international community . As the worlds lone superpower , what the United States saysor does n't  say saycreates , defines and clarifies international norms on what kind of state behavior is acceptable . <p> But of course , if there are no consequences when norms are violated , there never was a norm in the first place .

First , he should articulate and advance a clear strategy to bring the genocide to an end that goes beyond the platitudes of " utterly destroying " the Islamic State . Second , he should set the United States on a course to hold those within the Islamic State accountable before an international tribunal when the dust has settled on this conflict . <p> Moving toward word and deed <p> Those of us who have advocated for months for this genocide declaration must give the Obama administration credit : they had the opportunity to remain silent . There was certainly enough precedent to convince themselves that silence was the wisest option .

Burwell . <p> So who are the Little Sisters , and how did they end up at the highest court in our land ? <p> The Little Sisters of the Poor are an organization of nuns who offer homes and care for impoverished elderly people around the world . Their lives are given to the hundreds of humble tasks of caring for the elderly poor , feeding them , meeting their physical needs and providing them with heavenly hope . <p> They pay for their work by a tradition of begging . Through daily rounds to local businesses asking for food and other items to offset their operating expenses , small fundraising campaigns and weekend visits to churches , the nuns scrape together their meager budget , trusting that God will provide . <p> And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ObamaCare ) , the government is giving them the option to either violate their conscience or pay huge fines , fines that would dramatically cut into their service to the poor . <p> Their case , which involves The Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious organizations , is a consolidation of several cases all asking the Court to do the same thinguphold their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion . Specifically , they are asking to be allowed to exercise their sincerely held religious belief about the sanctity of life by not being forced to provide access to their employees to contraception with abortive effects . The issues at hand arose when the Affordable Care Act was passed into law and certain parts of the law had to be filled in by regulation . One of those regulations dealt with health insurance plans providing various types of contraception , including some that Christians of numerous denominations consider to be equivalent to abortion . <p> The Little Sisters of the Poor , and many other religious organizations that are n't  covered by a church exemption to this regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of providing the mandated abortion pills . The government tried various ways to make it better , but each one failed to address the issues of conscience raised by the groups . <p> The governments ultimate solution allowed the groups to abstain from paying for the drugs , but required them to give their employees a form that entitles the employee to free abortion-pills financed by the government . The government argues that it is providing a sufficient accommodation for the religious groups , because they no longer have to directly pay for the controversial drugs . Yet , their " solution " still requires the Little Sisters to affirmatively act and participate in the government 's scheme to provide contraception and abortifacients . <p> David French at National Review succinctly explains why this is a significant problem for religious liberty : <p> But here 's the problem : The certification is not an " opt out , " its a document that actually empowers a third party to provide free abortion pills . In that way , its more like a voucher than an opt-out . Imagine if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to require you to pay for abortions , but we will require you to provide employees with a document that entitles them to a free abortion at the Planned Parenthood clinic down the street . " Would anyone think for a moment that respected religious liberty ? Yet that 's the essence of the government " accommodation " here . The Little Sisters object to providing an abortion/contraception voucher a voucher that could be redeemed for free abortifacients at the discretion of a third-party administrator . <p> The government argues that it is simply providing a way for the Little Sisters to object , and then the insurance provides the contraception without any cost to the Little Sisters . But , again , this is not an issue about money ; this is an issue of conscience . <p> The Little Sisters ' conscience will not allow them to take any action that leads to the dispersal of abortifacients . Right now , by filing a form or writing to HHS to tell them of their religious objection and the details of their insurance plan , the Little Sisters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurer is required to provide contraception free of charge . <p> The Little Sisters view this as a sin .

Burwell this term . <p> In oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Wednesday , the eight justices seemed predictably divided . The four reliably liberal justices all posed questions that clearly supported the governments position . Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito seemed in favor of the Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious organizations . Justice Thomas is believed to favor them as well . With Justice Scalias seat being vacant , that leaves Justice Kennedy as the usual swing vote . <p> If Justice Kennedy sides with the conservatives as he did in Hobby Lobby , then the outcome will most likely be 4-4 .

The sincerely held religious beliefs in this case are just the tip of the iceberg of the religious liberty implications of Supreme Court jurisprudence which could weigh the regulatory states agenda above our fundamental right to freely exercise our religion . <p> There is a lot at stake for America in this case , but thankfully we have a Heavenly Father who holds all things together .

@@100509312 @4709312/ <h> 4 things to know about the Republican primary in Tennessee <p> It can be overwhelming to step into the voting booth . Immediately you realize that you are voting on much more than you anticipated . On March 1 , known as Super Tuesday , voters will have the opportunity to choose their candidate for the Republican or Democratic nomination . As we get closer to Super Tuesday , discussions of a contested or deadlocked GOP convention this election cycle have become common . Though Donald Trump clearly leads coming out of the Nevada Caucus , he could have trouble reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination , especially if the GOP field does not begin to narrow . <p> In years prior , it has been common practice for candidates with fewer delegates to release their delegates to the presumptive nominee . The convention is mostly without drama . This practice has several implications , most notably the symbolic display of unity it shows to those within the GOP and to voters across the country . The narrative this election cycle is somewhat unprecedented since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention ( 1960 for Democrats &amp; 1976 for Republicans ) . <p> As a result , the selection of those delegates that the voting citizens of Tennessee send to the GOP convention is as important or even more important than their vote for GOP nominee , in the case of a contested convention . Here are four things Tennesseans need to know about a contested convention and the delegate selection process in Tennessee : <p> 1 . What is a delegate ? <p> Delegates are those individuals chosen by each state to represent their respective party at their conventions . The selection process varies from state to state , depending on how each states party has the selection process drawn up . <p> 2 . The delegates you select could impact who the eventual nominee is . <p> If Republicans enter their convention with no clear-cut nominee , meaning no candidate has garnered the majority number of delegates required to win the nomination , then the delegates sent to the convention could very well decide the nominee for the Republican Party ( not the GOP primary voters ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . What is a contested convention ? <p> In this situation , there would be multiple ballot processes . On the first two ballots , delegates must vote for the candidate to whom they are bound . If , by chance , after the first two ballots no candidate has received the 1,237 votes needed to win , the delegates would then be free to cast votes as individuals . For instance , if , hypothetically , there are a couple hundred or more delegates there for Gov . John Kasich , theyd then have the opportunity to cast a ballot for someone else ( likely Donald Trump , Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz ) . This process is repeated until a candidate receives the 1,237 delegates required to win the nomination . Obviously , there are countless other possible scenarios out there , but this gives you a better idea of the process . <p> 4 . Vote for the delegates who are pledged to your choice for the nomination . <p> When you enter the voting booth , you will first see the candidates listed followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they are pledged ) . You will have the opportunity to vote for 14 delegates ( statewide ) , then three more delegates within your respective congressional district . <p> This process varies by state , with some quite similar to Tennessee . I would encourage you , if you live outside of Tennessee , to research the delegate selection process for your state prior to voting . You 'll avoid that all-too-familiar feeling of being overwhelmed in the voting booth . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182

Awhile back , I asked my friend Angela Bassett to share . Angela is the homeschooling mom of three adorable little girls . She and her husband Justin also have a little girl in Heaven , Charlotte Jane . I asked her to help us understand what it 's like to lose a child and to grieve with hope in Christ . I also asked her to help us know how to help those who are grieving . I invite you to read and listen with a heart to minister to women in her same position . <p> On February 17 , 2010 , as the sun broke through the darkness of night outside of Cook Children 's Hospital , Justin and I held the lifeless body of our precious baby girl . After Charlotte Jane 's week-long fight for life , her little body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered her last breath in our arms as we wept and cried out to God in worship . <p> While we 'd known that Charlotte 's life would be full of challenges , telling her goodbye just after we 'd met was overwhelming . I still remember walking out of the doors of the NICU that morning to see my dearest friend , Taber , sitting and waiting to embrace me and cry with me . She had no words to say that I remember , but she was there . She held me close . She knew that 's what I needed . Justin is incredible , and he was such a rock for me in that season , but there was something unique about having a fellow mom there by my side . She truly grieved with me . <p> In the days that followed , there was a lot to be done : a funeral home to choose and meet with , a cemetery to choose , a memorial service to plan , two big sisters to tell that Charlotte was not coming home to our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pictures to print , balloons to order , music to choose , a grave to be dug , people to feed , and the list goes on . All the while I was still healing from giving birth just seven days prior . <p> Conquering to-do lists <p> There were obviously things that had to be done by Justin and me , but everything else was put on a list , and a team of women from our church banded together and conquered all of it . I am not typically one to ask for help , but in this case , it felt very natural to just let those around me take care of me . These women were not pushy , but they were assertive in asking how they could serve us . I never felt that asking them to do something was a burden . Taber was my point of contact and everyone knew to go through her when seeking out how to serve our family . This was incredibly helpful , so I did n't feel obligated to return a million text messages . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food kept coming for at least two weeks . This gave us a good opportunity to just " be " as a family and begin to grieve and heal . We did n't just get dinner every nightladies brought some of our favorite breakfast foods and things that were easy to reheat . This blessed me greatly , because it was especially hard to get going in the mornings . Food was the last thing on my mind , yet I had little loves who were hungry . One friend brought a huge bag of Costco snacks for us . I still remind her what a treasure that was . Absolutely nothing in me wanted to be standing in a grocery store with a million snack options and trying to make a reasonable decision ; the Costco bag served us well ! <p> Some other wise friends brought a Chick-fil-a party tray that lasted us several days for lunch . Others simply left coffee or special treats on the doorstep .

Often they would just say , " I 'm coming to get the girls at 10:00 , " so I did n't have to make any decisions or wonder if they were just offering to be nice . I do n't remember who it was , but one friend told me very clearly , " Please do n't write us thank you notes . " As much as I wanted to put into words my thanks , that was incredibly freeing ! I had permission to just take care of me and to love my family . <p> Writing notes <p> One of the most precious gifts I received was at least one note from a friend every week for the entire first year after Charlotte 's death . A sweet friend compiled a list of those who had been especially invested in our journey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was amazing for several reasons . <p> It said to our family that our friends had not forgotten . <p> It provided me with encouragement and truth when I was not able to seek it out on my own . Lastly , <p> It shared how God was using Charlottes life in my friends lives . This gave me such joy in the midst of my grief because I was reminded that nothing is wasted in God 's economy . He works all things for good . <p> Celebrating birthdays <p> On Charlotte 's first birthday , those friends gathered with me and celebrated her life . They gave me notes , encouraged me and again they said with their actions that , " We have not forgotten ! You are loved ! Charlotte 's life is worthy of celebration ! " This year was Charlotte 's fourth birthday . Friends still gathered . A meal was shared . Cake was eaten . My girl was celebrated , and I was able to talk about what God has been teaching me recently through Charlotte Jane . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been nothing short of incredible . They have not forgotten . They have walked this road shoulder to shoulder with me , only letting me go alone when there was a narrow opening that I have had to face myself . Even then , they were there to greet me on the other side and to continue the journey as a visible reminder that Jesus never leaves my side , and he alone brings true freedom . <p> Ministering to your community <p> While I hope you never have to walk this road with a member of your community , the reality is , in our broken world , it 's likely that you will . I encourage you to pursue these women and rally the troops to care for them as much as possible . This is a prime opportunity for the Body of Christ to come together and function as God intended . It can be a beautiful example of the love of Christ on display for those who follow Christ and those who do n't . I can give you multiple examples of people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family through Charlotte 's life and death . <p> In addition to what Ive written about , here are a few more tangible ways to serve women who have experienced the loss of a child : <p> Think practically . Take any weight that you possibly can . <p> Grieve with her . Allow yourself to go to those hard places with her and to feel the depths of her pain . <p> Encourage her with Truth . Remind her frequently that she is loved and lifted up , well beyond the first weeks . <p> Give her the opportunity to talk about her little one by asking questions , while always asking the Holy Spirit to guide your conversation so you know when to back off . <p> Celebrate the life of the child . <p> By this , all people will know you are my disciples , if you have love for one another .

@@100509315 @4709315/ <h> Three reasons why every American Christian should vote <p> We are in the midst of a presidential election that , even to this political junkie , becomes tiresome with the bombast and vitriol , cliques and platitudes , polls and pundits . Every election , brave candidates step forward for public vetting , reminding us of the deep flaw and corruption present even in the best of humanity . <p> At times , Christians are tempted to despair , wondering if its even worth voting , if the politicians and the programs offered are even worth engaging . Perhaps its better , some muse , to simply sit out an election . Others wonder if , by voting , they are usurping the sovereignty of a God who works through the affairs of men to put in power whom he will ( Rom. 13:1 ; Dan . 2:21 ; Psa . 75:7 ) . <p> I understand the temptation toward disengagement in the voting process , but I believe every Christian should vote . Here are three reflections from Scripture that might help inform your decision : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prophet Jeremiah told the Jewish exiles in pagan Babylon to " seek the welfare of their city " by building , planting , creating and cultivating . This was difficult instruction for the people of God , thrust into a culture where their way of life and their values were out of step with those around them . What 's more , false prophets were telling the Jewish exiles that soon theyd be delivered from Babylon and would have their kingdom back . Jeremiah was tasked with the job of telling them that , no , they would not get their kingdom back , that this exile would last for many years , and that the kingdom they sought would be fulfilled , ultimately , in the everlasting kingdom of Christ . <p> New Testament Christians are not Jewish exiles , but there is something we can learn from the words of Jeremiah . We , too , are exiles in a world that is at odds with our beliefs . We too face the temptation to withdraw into our ourselves and disengage from the world around us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are called to live on mission in our communities and in our country . <p> Thankfully , many evangelicals are beginning to see their surroundings , not as the Promised Land , but as Babylon , as a mission field , as a place where God has called them to reflect , in part , the coming Kingdom of God . This movement is a movement of Godbut what I fear , when I talk to many missional Christians , is a reticence to engage the politics that affect the cities they love . Jesus told us that we should love our neighbor as ourselveshow can we love our neighbor , how can we seek the welfare of our cities , if we sheepishly abdicate the opportunity to choose the people who lead us ? How can we love our neighbor if we ignore the policies and structures that affect him ? <p> This does n't  mean Christians should turn their church lobbies into political party headquarters . It does n't  mean Christians should pledge allegiance to a candidate . It does n't  mean the church should lose its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do teach us , however , is that taking our vote seriously is one way , an important way , in which we love our neighbors and love our cities . <p> 2 . We should vote because God has given us a stewardship for which we will be held accountable . In a representative republic like the United States , citizens are given a share of powerwe are tasked with electing our local , state , and national leaders . This is n't a perfect system and history has shown that even in a great country like the United States , the system can at times be gamed and manipulated . And even the best politicians often pander to the worst fears and base instincts of the people in order to win their vote . But this is the system we have . <p> In Romans 13 , Paul reminds us that all civil authority is granted by God ( Rom. 13:1-7 ) . This power to votethis is a God-given divestment of authority to the voter . This means that not only will government officials be held accountable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the choices they made or did n't  make come election time . In a sense , Christian citizens in America are not only the subjects ; they are also , in some sense , Caesar ( Mark 12:17 ) . <p> This responsibility should change the way we vote in two ways . First , it should move us away from the idea that to vote is to put your full faith and power in a candidate or movement . We vote , not because we believe our man or woman will usher in the Kingdom , but because we are fulfilling a God-given stewardship . Secondly , it should remind us that , even in the best election with the most inspiring of choices , we are choosing between two fallen sinners . Every election is about the lesser of two evils . <p> 3 . We should vote because it can help speak up for the vulnerable and help gospel advance . On issues of human dignity , a vote for or against a candidate can be a vote for or against human dignity . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on issues of life , dignity and religious liberty . Its a way to love our neighbor by seeking the common good . We should n't vote , of course , because a candidate or a party is going to make America a theocracy . We should n't project onto the White House what only the church should fulfill . Civil government , at best , protects its people , seeks justice for the poor and vulnerable , and guarantees religious liberty . <p> Some well-meaning Christians take a defensive posture , arguing that Christians should not work for religious freedombut this is at odds with Jesus , who told his audience that there are limits on the authority given by God to governments . The conscience belongs , not to Caesar , but to God ( Mark 12:17 ) . This is also at odds with Paul , who told Timothy to pray for a government that would protect the freedom of Christ followers so the gospel could advance ( 1 Tim . 2:1-3 ) . <p> Sure , history has shown that the advance of the kingdom of God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrived under severe persecution . But Christians should not wish for government pressure nor abdicate their God-given role in influencing the government .

@@100509316 @4709316/ <h> Justice Scalias Two Most Essential Speeches <p> During his long and illustrious career , the late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote hundreds of thousands of words and delivered hundreds of hours worth of speeches . While there are dozens that could be considered essential , there are two speeches in particular that I believe every American citizen should be familiar with . <p> There is considerable overlap between the two speeches since the latter seems to be a revision of the former . But taken together they present not only Justice Scalias views on judicial interpretation , but also a prescient analysis of the failures of the modern judicial system and a prophetic warning about the future of the U.S. Constitution . <p> Although I would highly recommend reading both speeches in their entirety , the following is a summation of the major themes and a selection of the key quotes . Excerpts are marked with " C " when taken from the speech and Catholic University and " W " when taken from the Woodrow Wilson International Center address : <p> What " originalism " isand is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreting the Constitution is to begin with the text , and to give that text the meaning that it bore when it was adopted by the people . " He clarifies that this is not synonymous with " strict constructionism " : " I do not think the Constitution , or any text should be interpreted either strictly or sloppily ; it should be interpreted reasonably . " ( W ) <p> Scalia also rejected the notion of " original intent . " As he explained , <p> You will sometimes hear originalism described as the theory of original intent . You will never hear me refer to original intent , because I am first of all a textualist , and secondly an originalist . If you are a textualist , you do n't care about the intent , and I do n't care if the Framers of the U.S. Constitution had some secret meaning in mind when they adopted its words . I take the words as they were promulgated to the people of the United States , and what is the fairly understood meaning of those words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , which is why I do n't use legislative history . The words are the law . I think that 's what is meant by a government of laws , not of men . We are bound not by the intent of our legislators , but by the laws which they enacted , laws which are set forth in words , of course . ( C ) <p> Originalism was once judicial orthodoxy While originalism is now a minority view among judges , it was , until about 50 years ago , considered the orthodox method of judicial interpretation . Even the American people had an originalist perpective of the Constitution . <p> As an example , Scalia points to the 19th Amendment , which is the amendment that gave women the vote . <p> It was adopted by the American people in 1920 . Why did we adopt a constitutional amendment for that purpose ? The Equal Protection Clause existed in 1920 ; it was adopted right after the Civil War . And you know that if the issue of the franchise for women came up today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone would come to the Supreme Court and say , " Your Honors , in a democracy , what could be a greater denial of equal protection than denial of the franchise ? " And the Court would say , " Yes ! Even though it never meant it before , the Equal Protection Clause means that women have to have the vote . " <p> But that 's not how the American people thought in 1920 . In 1920 , they looked at the Equal Protection Clause and said , " What does it mean ? " Well , it clearly does n't  mean that you cant discriminate in the franchise not only on the basis of sex , but on the basis of property ownership , on the basis of literacy . None of that is unconstitutional . And therefore , since it was n't unconstitutional , and we wanted it to be , we did things the good old-fashioned way and adopted an amendment . ( W ) <p> " Immutability was regarded as its characteristic , " he adds , " What the Constitution meant when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing does n't change just because we think that meaning is no longer adequate to our times . " ( C ) <p> If we find the Constitution 's meaning to be inadequate , he says , we as Americans can simply amend the document . <p> Originalism has been replaced with the " Living Constitution " When originalism was the accepted theory of interpretation , activist judges had to resort to lying about the meaning of the Constitution to get the outcome they wanted , says Scalia . But now that the Constitution is considered to be a document that is living and evolving , the courts do n't  even have to resort to deception they can simply interpret the meaning to be anything they want . The result : <p> All sorts of rights that clearly did not exist at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights exist today . It 's plain absolutely plain , that the right to an abortion was not thought to exist in 1791 or at the time that the post-Civil War amendments were adopted , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's absolutely plain that there was no right to die , since there were laws against suicide . And you can go right down the list . ( C ) <p> How " Substantive Due Process " led to federal protection of same-sex marriage and abortion on demand Substantive due process , which Scalia calls a " contradiction in terms , " is a principle which allows courts to protect certain rights deemed fundamental from government interference under the authority of the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution . <p> What substantive due process is is quite simple the Constitution has a Due Process Clause , which says that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty or property without due process of law . Now , what does this guarantee ? Does it guarantee life , liberty or property ? No , indeed ! All three can be taken away . You can be fined , you can be incarcerated , you can even be executed , but not without due process of law . Its a procedural guarantee . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s at least , in fact the first case to do it was Dred Scott . But it became more popular in the 1920s . The Court said there are some liberties that are so important , that no process will suffice to take them away . Hence , substantive due process . <p> Within the last 20 years , we have found to be covered by due process the right to abortion , which was so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that it was criminal for 200 years ; the right to homosexual sodomy , which was so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that it was criminal for 200 years . So it is literally true , and I do n't  think this is an exaggeration , that the Court has essentially liberated itself from the text of the Constitution , from the text and even from the traditions of the American people . It is up to the Court to say what is covered by substantive due process . ( W ) <p> Both liberals and conservatives embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as prepared as Liberals to create new rights under this evolutionist theory of the Constitution . " ( C ) The dividing line is not between liberals and conservatives but between those who think the meaning of the text is fixed and those who believe it continuously evolves to meet the needs of society . <p> A crash course in Marbury v. Madison One of the most helpful sections in these speeches is Scalias explanation of Marbury v. Madison , the Supreme Court case that gave us judicial review : <p> The only reason federal courts sit in judgment of the constitutionality of federal legislation is not because they are explicitly authorized to do so in the Constitution . Some modern constitutions give the constitutional court explicit authority to review German legislation or French legislation for its constitutionality , our Constitution does n't  say anything like that . But John Marshall says in Marbury v. Madison : Look , this is lawyers work . What you have here is an apparent conflict between the Constitution and the statute . And , all the time , lawyers and judges have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comport with each other . If they cant , its judges work to decide which ones prevail . When there are two statutes , the more recent one prevails . It implicitly repeals the older one . But when the Constitution is at issue , the Constitution prevails because it is a " superstatute . " I mean , that 's what Marshall says : Its judges work . ( W ) <p> Problems arise , however , when we do n't  treat the Constitution as a text with a fixed meaning : <p> If you believe , however , that the Constitution is not a legal text , like the texts involved when judges reconcile or decide which of two statutes prevail ; if you think the Constitution is some exhortation to give effect to the most fundamental values of the society as those values change from year to year ; if you think that it is meant to reflect , as some of the Supreme Court cases say , <p> particularly those involving the Eighth Amendment , if you think it is simply meant to reflect the evolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society if that is what you think it is , then why in the world would you have it interpreted by nine lawyers ? What do I know about the evolving standards of decency of American society ? I 'm afraid to ask . <p> If that is what you think the Constitution is , then Marbury v. Madison is wrong . It should n't be up to the judges , it should be up to the legislature . We should have a system like the English whatever the legislature thinks is constitutional is constitutional . They know the evolving standards of American society , I do n't  . So in principle , its incompatible with the legal regime that America has established . ( W ) <p> The Living Constitution replaces our representative democracy with an out-of-touch oligarchy Why should nine justices determine how society is " evolving " ? After all , notes Scalia , he himself was out of touch with the American people : <p> I 'm not very good at determinating what the aspirations of the American people are . I am out of touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch . People mention movie stars and I do n't know who they 're talking about , and I get a blank look on my face . If you want somebody who 's in touch with what are the evolving standards of decency that reflect a maturing society , ask the Congress to make the relevant decisions . <p> And of course that 's the way it 's done in the United Kingdom . The Parliament says what the English Constitution consists of . <p> So , if you really believe in the evolving theory , and you 're right about this , then we made a mistake in Marbury v. Madison , and the Supreme Court should n't stick its nose into this stuff at all . It should be up to the Congress to determine where we evolve . What makes you think a committee of nine lawyers ought to tell where we 're evolving to ? I 'm a philosophy minor , but I did n't train as a philosopher . I 'm just a lawyer , just between you and me . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Originalism confines judges , and limits them to the meaning of the text . But under the theory of the Living Constitution , judges are given the power to govern the American people : <p> What is the criterion that governs the Living Constitutional judge ? What can you possibly use , besides original meaning ? Think about that . Natural law ? We all agree on that , do n't  we ? The philosophy of John Rawls ? That 's easy . There really is nothing else . You either tell your judges , " Look , this is a law , like all laws , give it the meaning it had when it was adopted . " Or , you tell your judges , " Govern us . You tell us whether people under 18 , who committed their crimes when they were under 18 , should be executed . You tell us whether there ought to be an unlimited right to abortion or a partial right to abortion . You make these decisions for us . " I have put this question you know I speak at law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put this question to the faculty all the time , or incite the students to ask their Living Constitutional professors : " Okay professor , you are not an originalist , what is your criterion ? " There is none other . ( W ) <p> The Living Constitution kills the actual Constitution When judges abandon originalism and the original meaning to the text of the Constitution , it is merely a matter of time before the Constitution itself is abandoned . <p> In the long run , non-originalism triumphant and rampant is the death knell of the Constitution . As I suggested earlier , the whole purpose of the Constitution is to prevent a future society from doing whatsoever it wants to do . To change , to evolve , you do n't need a constitution . All you need is a legislature , as well as a ballot box . Things will change as fast as you want . You want to create new rights and/or destroy old ones ? A legislature and the electoral franchise are all that you need . The only reason you need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want a majority to be able to change . <p> That 's my most important function as a judge in the American legal system . I have to tell the majority to take a hike . I tell them : " I do n't care what you want . The Bill of Rights says you can not do it . " <p> Now , if there is no fixed absolute , if the Constitution evolves to mean what it ought to mean today , what makes you think the majority is going to leave it to judges to decide what the Constitution ought to mean ? The people comprising the popular or legislative majority will do that only if they think the decisions of the courts will be supportive of their particular interests , values , and opinions . If there are no fixed legal standards , if the justices on the Supreme Court are supposed to tell us what are the evolving standards of decency that reflect a maturing society , a majority of the people and its political leadership will look for judges who agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have the absolutely crazy system in which we conduct a mini-plebiscite on the meaning of the Constitution every time we select a person to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court . <p> Why nominations to the Supreme Court have become of existential importance to our nation When Scalia was nominated for the Supreme Court , he was approved by the Senate 98-0 . He explains why that cant happen today : <p> Today , barely 20 years later , it is difficult to get someone confirmed to the Court of Appeals . What has happened ? The American people have figured out what is going on . If we are selecting lawyers , if we are selecting people to read a text and give it the fair meaning it had when it was adopted , yes , the most important thing to do is to get a good lawyer . If on the other hand , were picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a new constitution with all sorts of new values to govern our society , then we should not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who agree with us , the majority , as to whether there ought to be this right , that right and the other right . We want to pick people that would write the new constitution that we would want . <p> And that is why you hear in the discourse on this subject , people talking about moderate , we want moderate judges . What is a moderate interpretation of the text ? Halfway between what it really means and what youd like it to mean ? There is no such thing as a moderate interpretation of the text . Would you ask a lawyer , " Draw me a moderate contract ? " The only way the word has any meaning is if you are looking for someone to write a law , to write a constitution , rather than to interpret one . The moderate judge is the one who will devise the new constitution that most people would approve of . So , for example , we had a suicide case some terms ago , and the Court refused to hold that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were not yet ready to say that . Stay tuned , in a few years , the time may come , but were not yet ready . " And that was a moderate decision , because I think most people would not want if we had gone , looked into that and created a national right to assisted suicide , that would have been an immoderate and extremist decision . ( W ) <p> The Living Constitution + Majoritarianism = Recipe for Destruction The Living Constitution has only been around for about 50 years . But it is already appears poised to undermine 200 years of the rule of law : <p> The Bill of Rights is devised to protect you and me against , who do you think ? The majority . My most important function on the Supreme Court is to tell the majority to take a walk . And the notion that the justices ought to be selected because of the positions that they will take , that are favored by the majority , is a recipe for destruction of what we have had for 200 years . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182 
@@100509317 @4709317/ <h> 5 reasons leaders fail <p> Recently I had a discussion with some friends about some public leadership fails in the news . Our conversation turned to a general topic of leadership and things we 've observed . What struck us was how these things evolve from little , seemingly insignificant decisions that form the culture out of which unhealthy leadership grows . In other words , nobody wakes up one day and says to himself , " I 'm going to strive to be an authoritarian leader who wreaks havoc on the people I serve . " It just does n't  happen that way . Leaders start with good intentions . They start as " normal " people . So how do leaders fail ? I think there are five basic mistakes leaders make : <p> 1 . Leaders fail to build healthy accountability structures for themselves early on <p> Nobody wakes up one day and says , " I 'd like to be a jerk who does n't  listen to anyone . " Instead , it begins slowly , early on , when leaders fail to intentionally build honest voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean friends , mentors , family who are given permission to tell us when we are out of line . We always think this needs to happen when we " make it big " but that 's a mistake . We should do this when nobody knows who we are . And it begins by receiving healthy criticism from people we love instead of adopting a " haters gon na hate " mentality . Its important to do this early on because once we " make it big " ( whatever that means ) , well be less resistant to criticism . Leaders who surround themselves with sycophants who fawn at their every movethis builds the culture that breeds authoritarian leadership . Its important for us to have one or two people in our organizations , in our circle of friends , in our families who can tell us , at times , " Dude , you were a jerk to that person " or " Hey , I do n't  think this is a good move . " David had Nathan . Who is your Nathan ? I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be structured with this kind of accountability . This is why ecclesiology ( church governance and structure ) matters . This is why organizational structure matters . The " Im a CEO/King and nobody tells me what to do " model breeds leaders who fail . <p> 2 . Leaders fail to move beyond personal grudges and hurts <p> I 'm a fan of reading biographies , particularly biographies of political leaders . These are the books I bring to the beach ( I know , its pathetic ) . In my reading across a wide variety of leaders , I 've found a singular trait that characterizes leaders who could best be described as " tyrants . " This is the inability to forgive . Look closely at dictators who have ravaged countries and continents . Almost every one of them was operating off a hurt early in their lives that they never got over . I 've seen this with presidents , CEOs and pastors . If part of the motivation for assuming leadership is the opportunity to " prove everyone wrong " or " strike back at those who hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . Leaders who forgive are leaders are able to use their past as a catalyst for serving others and helping them through their hurt and pain . I think of Joseph , who rose to leadership in Egypt and instead of using his power to get vengeance on his betraying brothers , left justice in the hands of God and instead offered forgiveness ( Gen. 50:20 ) . <p> 3 . Leaders stop serving the mission and start serving themselves <p> This one is closely related to the first point . Unhealthy leaders begins when organizations allow or foster a kind of " leadership bubble " where the goals of the organization are simply to advance to the leaders personal interests . This can get complicated , because a good leader will have a reputation and a brand , so to speak , that will bring attention and honor to the organization he serves . But good leaders build a deep and wide organization and are unafraid to let others in the organization get attention if need be . Unhealthy leaders constantly monitor what is being said about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about serving the organizations theyve been entrusted with . Good leaders are humble , confident , winsome in their approach . And they are motivated not by building their own platform but by serving those God has called them to serve . <p> 4 . Leaders stop growing and listening <p> Most people think this is a function of age , that older leaders stop thinking they need to grow , change and learn . But I have not found this to be true . I 've met young leaders who think they are the experts in everything and I 've met older leaders who surprise me by their desire to grow . This is more of an ego/pride thing . Success is a difficult thing to handle , more so than failure . And without the patient work of the Holy Spirit sanctifying us we all tend to drift toward lethargy and pride . Good leaders constantly seek out new opportunities , new relationships , new coalitions that will help them grow as a leader and as a person . Bad leaders refuse to listen , grow jealous of others expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever admit they do n't  know everything . Im reminded of the maxim in Scripture that God " resists the proud but gives grace to the humble " ( James 4:6 ) . <p> 5 . Leaders think that " this couldnt happen to me . " <p> What strikes me most in our conversations about failed leadership is that almost none of us think it could happen to us . I think this is dangerous . Its very possible that someone **25;59;TOOLONG about some famous and terrible leadership crisis today could be the subject of a similar crisis in five years . The more we cringe and feign disgust at the examples we keep reading about , the more likely it is that well repeat the same mistakes . This is because the instinct that says , " How could this guy do this to his church . I would never do that " is the very instinct that leads to our downfall . We should all treat others mistakes like Paul treated the failures of Israel in the Old Testament . We should " take heed , lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed at the pride we all have when someone falls and falls big , at the celebration of their demise and the virtual chest-beating we do on social media . This shows that were just as susceptible to making the same mistakes . Instead , like Paul , we should treat every sad story of leadership failure as a cautionary tale .

Many of us think that glorifying God and enjoying Him means singing praises , reading the Bible , and praying . You know , that personal , contemplative stuff . <p> That is certainly part of it . In fact , that part makes it possible for Gods people to joyfully and effectively serve Him . But our jobs are actually places where we should also be glorifying and enjoying God .

He said , " With good will render service , as to the Lord , and not to men " ( Ephesians 6:7 ) . I doubt many of us can say our situation is as dire as a slaves in the first century . <p> To get to this place in our own lives , we have to start at the Garden . God made humans to be producers .

@@100509319 @4709319/ <h> Six principles of a Jesus-centered moral order <p> For a couple centuries of American public life , a soft reliance on the state to endorse Christian values seemed to work just fine . Since most people assumed America was a " Christian nation , " it made sense that federal and state laws tacitly affirmed a biblical worldview and actively promoted Christian morals . From gambling and alcohol prohibition to tax exemptions and modesty laws , nominal Christianity benevolently reigned over the public square . Everyone stayed buttoned up , and , for the most part , we appeared to be a virtuous people , a moral people . <p> But in the twentieth century , more and more people began to see Christian morality as standing in the way of a new moral code : the morality of self-fulfillment . Throwing off burdensome traditional mores , people began to imagine life without a bothersome God standing watch . John Lennon captured the zeitgeist in his perennial hit : " Imagine there 's no heaven , its easy if you try . . . " <p> New research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which Americans pledge allegiance to the new moral code , which can be summed up in six guiding principles . <p> The New Moral Code <p> Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with each of the following statements . <p> Source : Barna OmniPoll , August 2015 , N = 1,000 <p> As you can see , the morality of self-fulfillment has even crept into American Christianity . Large percentages of practicing Christians embrace the principles of the new moral code . Too many Christians have substituted comfortable living for a life changed by the gospel . The governments tacit endorsement of vaguely Christian morals has made it difficult , in many ways , to discern what it means to be faithful , beyond showing up . <p> In recent years , the morality of self-fulfillment has begun to bear its inevitable fruit : people want to fulfill themselves by doing things outside the bounds of cultural Christianity . And they do n't  want the law telling them they cant . <p> As a result of this shift , we are seeing laws that endorse the broader cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And according to that moral code , any competing moralitysay , a religionthat seeks to constrain someones pursuit of personal fulfillment must itself be constrained . <p> If something or someone stands in the way of my fulfillment , that obstacle must be removed . <p> In contrast to the dominant cultures embrace of self-fulfillment as the highest moral good , good faith Christians believe living under Gods moral order leads to human and societal flourishing . As Scripture says , physical training is of some benefit , but " training for godliness is much better , promising benefits in this life and in the life to come " ( 1 Tim . 4:8 ) . <p> Yet the extent to which the morality of self-fulfillment has taken hold of the hearts and minds of practicing Christians exposes an area of dangerous weakness in todays church .

Christians express something truly countercultural when we insist that real morality is rooted in something outside ourselves .

Also , consider the Guttmacher Institute numbers that say 65 percent of women who have abortions self-identify as Christian ( 37 percent , Protestant and 28 percent , Catholic ) . Christ gave his life for the church that she would be glorious , without spot or wrinkle or any other blemish ( Eph. 5:25-27 ) . And yet , abortion is a log in the eye of the church .

Will the church ignore what weve recently learned about the abortion industry from the Planned Parenthood exposT videos , or will we believe the words of Christ in Matthew 16:17-19 when he says that the powers of hell will not and can not conquer his church ? Only Christs church has the power to overcome this evil known as abortion in a battle that is ultimately spirituala battle that Christ has already won , but one we are currently facing . <p> A new way to minister to those considering abortion <p> Care Nets vision in launching our church initiative was to pull back the curtain and reveal the facts about abortion in the church and also offer the solution . We have developed a one-of-a-kind curriculum called Making Life Disciples ( MLD ) . MLD will equip the church to offer compassion , hope , help and discipleship to women and men considering abortion . <p> MLD is an out-of-the-box , six-part DVD curriculum specifically crafted to give a church everything it needs to start a pregnancy care ministry .

Churches will have engaging , visually beautiful video footage that will guide them through the challenging task of learning how to minister to those deceived by the culture into believing abortion is their only option . <p> Care Net is also humbled by the contribution of Tony Evans , senior pastor of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship , who participated in segments of MLD to call pastors to stand for life as well as emphasize the power of the gospel as we surround women and men with the love of the Father during one of the most frightening times of their lives . <p> Is the church ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help to women and men considering abortion ? Is the church ready to walk alongside unmarried parents by filling in the gap with mentors , friends and stand-in grandpas ?

Immediately you realize that you are voting on much more than you anticipated . On March 1 , known as Super Tuesday , voters will have the opportunity to choose their candidate for the Republican or Democratic nomination . Decades have passed since either party has had a contested convention ( 1960 for Democrats and 1976 for Republicans ) . But as we get closer to Super Tuesday , discussions of a contested or deadlocked convention this election cycle have become more common , particularly among Republicans , as there is a possibility that no candidate may earn 1,237 delegates required to win a majority and with it the nomination . <p> What this means is that more attention is being paid to the significance of delegates , and rightly so . What some voters do n't  realize before arriving at their polling place , though , is that they will be given the opportunity to vote not only for their preferred presidential candidate , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of a brokered or contested convention , delegates become very important . <p> Here are a few things that you should know about delegates . Ill focus on below on the GOP delegates , since Republicans are the more likely party to have a contested convention . <p> 1 . What is a delegate ? <p> Delegates are those individuals chosen by each state to represent their respective party at their conventions . The selection process varies from state to state , depending on how each states party has the selection process drawn up . <p> 2 . The delegates you select could impact who the eventual nominee is . <p> If Republicans enter their convention with no clear-cut nominee , meaning no candidate has garnered the majority number of delegates required to win the nomination , then the delegates sent to the convention could very well decide the nominee for the Republican Party ( not the GOP primary voters ) . This is what would be called a contested convention . <p> 3 . What is a contested convention ? <p> In this situation , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for the candidate to whom they are bound on the first ballot , which is determined by the results of their state 's primary or caucus . Most states release their delegates if the first ballot does not produce a candidate with a majority of votes ( though Tennessee binds their delegates for the first two rounds ) . When delegates are released , this means they are free to vote for another candidate on subsequent rounds of balloting . So , for instance , if there are Tennessee delegates for Ted Cruz , they would be required to vote for Cruz the first two rounds , but if neither ballot produces a majority thereafter , they would be released and could vote for someone else . In the case of a contested convention , balloting continues until a candidate receives the 1,237 delegates required to win the nomination . <p> 4 . Vote for the delegates who are pledged to your choice for the nomination . <p> When you enter the voting booth , you will first see the candidates listed , one of whom you may vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( broken down alphabetically by the candidate to whom they are pledged ) . You will have the opportunity to vote for 14 delegates ( statewide ) , then three more delegates within your respective congressional district . <p> This process varies by state . Our organization has offices in Tennessee and Washington , D.C. , so Ive written this article mostly from the context of the specifics of Tennessee . But regardless of where you live , delegates are important , so be sure to research the delegate selection process for your state prior to voting . You 'll avoid that all-too-familiar feeling of being overwhelmed in the voting booth . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182 
@@100509325 @4709325/ <h> Seven acts of grace in a marriage <p> After years of working with marriages , including my own , Ive come to a conclusion : Marriages that struggle are often lacking one key ingredient . Its something that , when missing from any relationship , will cause trouble in the relationship . The missing ingredient is called grace . And , when applied appropriately , its amazing . <p> If the marriage is struggling , one remedy is to apply more grace . Of course , it ultimately takes two people to make the marriage work , but one way to improve things is to interject more grace . When both parties are grace-giving to each other , the marriage can soar . <p> Here are seven acts of grace in a marriage : <p> Recognize differences You first have to know them , but you have to give grace for your uniqueness . No two people in the world are alike and that 's never more evident than in a marriage relationship . The more you understand those differences the better you 'll be able to grow the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grace of marriage you 'll spend a lifetime in discoverynever believing you 've got this person completely figured out , but always dating , always exploring new dreams together , always learning about each other . <p> Respect differences It is not enough just to know the differences , you have to accept them . Respect them . This does n't  mean making excuses for them but fully embracing the other persons uniqueness as a gift to the marriage and allowing them to work for the marriage rather than against it . I 'm an introvert . My wife is an extrovert . I cant always be introverted and respect her extroversion . And vice-versa . I need to talk and listen sometime for her . She needs to allow quiet sometimes for me , but when we blend the two differences together , we become a power couple for the ministry God has given us . <p> Clear boundaries Do n't  hold your spouse accountable for what they do n't  know . Understand the unique needs of each person to keep the marriage strong . Establish the boundaries that are reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Its not legalism , its giving grace to the other person . For example , I know that my wife needs quality time . Its her love language . I extend grace to her when I protect my schedule to spend ample time with her during the week . She knows I am fueled on her respect of me , so she " graces " me by not speaking down to me in public . <p> Forgive easily Have high standards for your marriage , but recognize two imperfect people are trying to uphold them . You 'll make mistakes . Both of you . You are n't  perfect . And , neither is the person you married . You extend grace when you practice granting forgiveness more than you practice holding a grudge . <p> Serve expecting nothing in return - Part of gracing one another is doing for each other with no strings attached . The goal is not a 50/50 partnership , but that each spouse extend 100% grace to one another . When a couple mutually submits to one anothereven out-serving each otherthe bond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Extend trust A marriage wont grow far beyond where trust is still being earned . Many of us bring our own hurts into a marriage . It can be difficult to place full confidence in the other person , especially after mistakes are made . For a marriage flourish , you have to risk being hurt and extend the grace of trust . ( There will be those reading this who have had reasons to mistrust their spouseI get thatand it takes time to recover from severe hurt in the marriage . At some point , however , for the marriage to ever be all it should be , a risk of trust will have to be given again . That takes grace . ) <p> Love the mundane Let 's be honest . We live in a fast-paced world and sometimes , if things are n't  moving fast enough , we can fall into routines and life can be boring . That bothers some of us more than others . For some of us , we love the bigthe grandiose . We love the mountaintop weekends and the pinnacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extraordinaire . And , frankly , its not . It ca n't be . And , if we are n't  careful , we can get bored even in the marriage . In fact , I 'd be bold enough to say boredom is a leading cause of marriages that fall into trouble . It often starts there at least . Grace in a marriage means that we learn to love the highswhich is easyand the lowswhich is hardand the mundanewhich is sometimesfor some peoplethe hardest of all . 43169 @qwx903169 43181 @qwx903181 43187 @qwx903187 43178 @qwx903178 
@@100509326 @4709326/ <h> A tribute to Justice Scalia <p> I never met Justice Scalia , but as a law student and a constitutional attorney , I feel like I 've spent hundreds of hours with him , absorbing his majority opinions and scathing dissents with the voracity most people read fiction books on the beach . <p> In 2008 while working on Capitol Hill , I attended an event at the Supreme Court where Justice Antonin Scalia spoke on his views of the Constitution , the Supreme Court and the role of government in our lives . <p> Although this is the closest I ever came to meeting Justice Scalia , it was enough to inspire so much of what would come next in my life . <p> It inspired me to go to law school , but not before serving as a teacher in a low-performing school in order to help shape our next generation of leaders . <p> It inspired me to get married to my best friend and to start a family at a young age , never forgetting what 's most important in life . ( Justice Scalia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine children and 28 grandchildren . May we all be so blessed . ) <p> It inspired my wife and I to speak up with passion and conviction for our beliefs , even if it was unpopular and would be mocked within the walls of our law school and beyond . In Con Law II , the constitutional law class that addresses controversial topics ranging from abortion and same-sex marriage to the death penalty and affirmative action , I was the only outspoken conservative Christian in the class . Just as Justice Scalia often did in defending the rights of criminal defendants , my defense of the Constitution as a guarantor of human freedom and human flourishing would often catch some of my progressive colleagues off guard . <p> But one day in class , my professor asked if anyone was willing to defend Justice Scalias defense of morality as a basis for law . Admittedly , I was n't paying very close attention . I was tired , and I was probably working during class as I was clerking at the same time I was attending law school . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defender of the Constitutiondidnt feel like putting up a fight . <p> Then I looked down at my textbook open on the desk , and a fiery dissent from Justice Scalia stared up at me . It inspired me to raise my hand . My professor called on me . <p> I 'd like to actually return to the previous point and defend morality as the basis for the law . In fact , as Justice Scalia points out , we are allowed to have a debate about which conceptions of morality should shape our laws . In fact , with our Constitution , we always have . But to pretend that morality is not the primary basis of our laws is to attack traditional religious norms while denying that secular orthodoxy is not espousing its own version of morality as well . And that is what is most dangerous to our debate and discourse . <p> My professor smiled and replied , " I had a feeling you 'd speak up and say that . " <p> Those words werent my own though . They were clearly shaped by the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Scalias opinions or watching him speak requires action from those of us who share his commitment to Biblical truth and admiration of the U.S. Constitution . It spurs us into the arena , into the battle of ideas that define our nation and in defense of a government " of the people , by the people , for the people " as President Lincoln stated more than 150 years ago . <p> One of my favorite paragraphs in Supreme Court history is found at the conclusion of the joint dissent in the 2012 case challenging the Affordable Care Act . Authored by Justice Scalia , along with Justices Thomas , Kennedy , and Alito , its a beautiful articulation of how our Framers viewed the Constitutions structures as the ultimate protection of individual liberty . <p> The Constitution , though it dates from the founding of the Republic , has powerful meaning and vital relevance to our own times . The constitutional protections that this case involves are protections of structure . Structural protectionsnotably , the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powersare less romantic and have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments . Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens . It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise , to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most important ones , for which reason they alone were embodied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment . The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty , and when we destroy it , we place liberty at peril . Todays decision should have vindicated , should have taught , this truth ; instead , our judgment today has disregarded it . <p> As Justice Scalia once said to a group of Christian lawyers , " God assumed from the beginning that the wise of the world would view Christians as fools . . . and He has not been disappointed . . . . If I have brought any message today , it is this : Have the courage to have your wisdom regarded as stupidity . Be fools for Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sophisticated world . " <p> Scalias legacy was shaped first and foremost by his deep Catholic faith . This faith led him to be a family man through and through . It also led him to realize that our fight is against principalities and powers , not against flesh and blood . <p> He said of his jurisprudential debates , " I attack ideas . I do n't  attack people . And some very good people have some very bad ideas . And if you cant separate the two , you got ta get another day job . " <p> This core belief also drove him to begood friends with his liberal opponents , taking Justice Kagan hunting not long after she joined the court and famously calling Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg one of his dearest friends in the entire world . <p> He famously said he would love to be stranded on a desert island with Justice Ginsburg . Reading her tribute to her late colleague and " best buddy " reflects the depths and authenticity of their decades-long friendship . <p> We live in an era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court continues to become a more politicized and activist institution , while Justice Scalia continually fought for judicial restraint . We tend to view our opponents as evil individuals who must be overcome . But Justice Scalia knew otherwise and lived otherwise . <p> As a father , grandfather , friend and one of the greatest defenders of our Constitution , Justice Scalia should be remembered and admired . But more so than that , to Christians and conservative constitutional attorneys like myself , may we remember how he befriended and loved his opponents while unwaveringly standing firm for what he knew was rightwith a broad smile , a rapier wit and unmatched passion . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182

Part 2 completes the list . <p> 3 . Unapologetically champion marriage and children <p> I 've often wondered why contemporary evangelicals are so reluctant to talk to our children about sex . I think a major reason is that we do n't really know what to say , because our primary goals for our children are often rooted in self-oriented educational goals , affluence and culturally defined vocational success and respectability . In other words , I fear many evangelical Christian parents would rather their children be affluent with a college degree , than married and less affluent without a college degree . The problem with the approach of self-oriented prolonged singleness is that while singleness provides a strategic opportunity for single-minded devotion and service to God , most people have divinely given sexual longings that are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Gen. 1-2 ) . As the apostle Paul contends , " But because of the temptation to sexual immorality , each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husbandfor it is better to marry than to burn with passion " ( 1 Cor. 7:2 , 9 ) . <p> Christian parents who fail to communicate the meaning and gospel significance of marriage are hastening the cultural confusion and decline of the sacred institution , and are training their children to place themselves in the path of sexual temptation . We act befuddled that a generation we have taught to put themselves first does not understand the importance of faithful self-sacrificial relationships beginning with marriage and family . If we feed our children the junk food of narcissistic self-esteem along with a side of the American dream , then we should not wonder why they do not have a healthy Christian worldview and embrace sinful self-oriented sexual fulfillment . If we are unwilling to tell our children that their sexual longings ought to be directed toward marriage then we have little left to say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen short because it has simply focused on saying " no " to promiscuity without a reciprocal " yes " in championing Christian marriage ? Could it be that evangelical impotence in dealing with the pornography crisis in our churches is partly because we have allowed marriage and sex to be defined in terms of self-fulfillment , rather than gospel-centric , self-sacrificial commitment ? Teaching our children a healthy Christian sexuality will begin with evangelicals who stop saying , " It is good that man should be alone until his 30s after he has a good education , career and individual achievements . " A healthy Christian sexuality will begin with evangelicals who stop saying , " Do n't be fruitful and multiply too much ; after all , you will not be able to afford a nice home in a good neighborhood . " We must tell our children the good news that Christian marriage and the glorious gospel it represents , liberates them from the ball and chain of trying to live the American dream . <p> 4 . Unhesitatingly answer questions when asked <p> Do not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world has plenty of answers and is unashamed to share them at every opportunity . We must not communicate to our children in a way that suggests the Bible does not have adequate answers to questions of sexuality . When children ask us about sexuality , we should communicate a sense of delight that they are coming to us for an answer to important questions . Do n't you want them seeking answers from you and not their friends at school or in the neighborhood ? <p> Here are some suggestions for dealing with sexual questions : <p> Clarify the question . <p> You do not want to answer a question they are not asking so a simple statement to make sure you know what they are asking is often helpful . <p> Satisfy the question with biblical truth . <p> You simply want to answer the question with truth . That does not mean that you must say everything you know related to the question , but that what you say must be true . <p> Do not over-answer the question . <p> Your child does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their question , but they do want their curiosity satisfied . <p> Clarify that you have answered their question . <p> This is as simple as saying something like , " Is that helpful ? " or " Is that what you wanted to know ? " <p> 5 . Commit to read the Bible together as a family <p> If you read the Bible together as a family , encouraging your children to ask questions , the topic of sex will be unavoidable . At the church I pastor , we have promoted a " read the Bible together plan " for the year . Among the many reasons we chose to do this is it forces parents to answer questions they might otherwise avoid . I told one of our staff members that when we began the readings , people with children would start asking , " What should we do when we get to the sections of Scripture that talk about sex ? Do we skip them ? " It happened just like I thought it would , which provided us an opportunity to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it great that they are asking you these questions ? It provides you a wonderful opportunity to give them a biblical framework for understanding questions related to sexuality . " <p> 6 . Be the first person to teach your child about sexual intercourse <p> While this is not always possible because of the way events unfold , it should be a parent 's goal to be the first person to teach their children about sexual intercourse . Every parent , around the time a child goes through puberty , ought to take their child on what I refer to as a manhood or womanhood retreat . The retreat marks the child 's passage into adulthood . Personally , I have taken my children to do something they found really fun and enjoyable , and had very direct conversations with them about sexual intercourse . A wonderfully helpful tool is Passport 2 Purity a resource offered by Dennis Rainey and Family Life Today . The CDs are well produced , provide clear but not crude explanations of sexual intercourse , and serve as a wonderful springboard to important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood or womanhood retreat is the beginning--not the end--of direct discussion about sexual intercourse and the struggle for sexual purity , and should open the door for vital future conversations . A retreat should also provide many fun moments and produce stories worth remembering for life . With one of my sons , I played the Passport to Purity CD . When Dennis Rainey began explaining sexual intercourse , my son yelled , " Dad are you listening to this guy ? He is sick ! " I replied , " You are about to have your world rocked this weekend son ! " <p> 7 . Use direct language but avoid being crude or medical <p> The biblical Song of Solomon provides a helpful model for parents . Is Song of Solomon a book about the relationship between Christ and the church , or the marriage of a man and a woman ? The answer is yes . Since marriage exists to picture the relationship between Christ and the church , all discussion of marriage is inextricably linked to Christ and the church . In the Song , Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingdom as displayed , and the love between the Messianic King and his subjects . The imagery of the Song of Solomon is unmistakable , but neither crude nor antiseptically medical . It uses direct language but retains the mystery of the gospel . I encourage parents who are teaching their children about sexual intercourse to briefly explain the medical terminology and the terms used on the street , and then explain the terms you prefer to use . <p> 8 . React to sexual sin with the gospel and not like a Pharisee or a Sadducee <p> A parent committed to raising up a next-generation Pharisee will respond to a child 's sexual sin by asserting , " I can not believe you would do that ! " No matter the sin , the Pharisee needs to clarify that we are not the kind of people who do things like that . A Sadducean parent , well acquainted with the good life and committed to maintaining the status quo for a new generation of Sadducees , will respond to a childs sexual sin by showing how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might say something like , " You do n't want to ruin your prospects for the future . You have so much going for you and so many opportunities ahead . " <p> A distinctively Christian approach to sexual sin would center on the gospel . The parent might say , " I am not surprised at all that you have sinned in this way . It should remind you that you do not simply sin but you are a sinner . The problem with the way you have sinned is that it is an offense against God and his gospel . " The child must know that you are praying that God will use the uncovering of this sexual sin to teach them that they need forgiveness for their sins . Gospel-centered Christian parenting is not marked by self-pity when a childs sin is uncovered and exposed . Such Christian parenting appreciates the unique gospel opportunity the uncovering of sin provides . Giving consequences for sin and pointing children to the gospel are a primary way Christian parents embrace their God-given responsibility as stewards of the gospel in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn about sex and how to respond to sexual urges .

Christian parents must remember that Satan does n't hate morality ; he hates the cross of Jesus Christ . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

If so , you 're the very one Alli Worthington had in mind when writing Breaking Busy : How to Find Peace and Purpose in a World of Crazy . In her new release , this wife , mother of five and executive director of Propel Women draws from her life experiences , research and the Bible to help women break the cycle of " crazy busy . " She sketches out a framework women can use to find Gods purpose for their life instead of succumbing to the relentless , runaway pace of todays culture . <p> How she does it <p> Worthington is a winsome writer and skilled at keeping things practical . Her easy-to-read style and manageable book sections allow busy women to read smaller portions on the go . And her humor and transparency keep you easily engaged . <p> Worthington starts her book by setting a helpful paradigm for what it means to function " within capacity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that she " gets it . " She lays out seven diagnostic warning signs to help women discover if they 're living within their God-given capacity . And she poses several questions to help women gauge their personal limits and embrace them . From the beginning , Worthington encourages honest self-reflection about what motivates your crazy busy life by sharing the ins and outs of her own story . <p> Worthington then spends the remainder of the book guiding the reader through an exploration to find " our sweet spot " : the place where one is operating at their best and fulfilling their " God-given destiny . " She explores nine areas to consider when making choices toward a more balanced life , covering a range of topics from relationships and a personal sense of calling to time management and communication styles . Each chapter concludes with a list of action steps to implement . But in the midst of the practical , Worthington does not lose sight of how a womans heart and mind work . She speaks to the inner fears and challenges common to women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worth powerfully influence our lives . <p> Great take-aways <p> One of the best features of this book is its practicality . Alli Worthington is truly gifted at breaking down concepts into accessible approaches to life . And she loves lists . So if you 're a bullet point-person , you will love the organization of her thinking through the crazy business of life . <p> Also , the overall mission of this book is praiseworthy . Women without friends to ask heels-on-the-ground questions about gifts and abilities will find a friend in Worthington and her practical wisdom . The author has planted deep roots in the growing field of life management , and this book bears some good fruit . But its Worthingtons transparency that makes her so helpful here . Shes refreshingly open about her familys challenges and the heart work the Lord has done during those critical times . She teaches by example that " breaking busy " includes honesty before the Lord , others and ourselves . <p> Pump the brakes on breaking busy <p> Breaking Busy is marketed as using " solid biblical principles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective on knowing God and his will is the greatest cause for concern . To be sure , Alli Worthingtons love for the Lord is evident and sincere . She wants her readers to seek Gods will versus their own agenda . And she uses Scripture references throughout the book , offering helpful examples of applying biblical truth during personal trials . So , you may ask , " What 's the problem ? " <p> The concern lies in Worthingtons paradigm for how one knows Gods will . More than once she testifies to hearing God speak specific messages to her in prayer . Worthington does not claim to hear Gods audible voice . She does , however , claim to understand specific , personal words from God through " nudges " or " senses " that seem to be disconnected from Scripture . One key example is when she felt the Lord telling her to quit the company she began . Worthington states that during a prayer time she " clearly felt God nudge me with two words , Quit Blissdom. " A second example occurred while deciding whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing her prayer time , she says , " As clear as day , I sensed the answer . It was very simple : Do it. " <p> Could these examples be just two exceptions to Worthingtons view on knowing the will of God ? Unfortunately , it seems the examples are part of a pattern . In chapter two , Worthington aligns her personal paradigm in listening to God with Sarah Youngs book , Jesus Calling . The substantial quote depicts a God who speaks subjectively through any means possible : the sun , the wind , faces of loved ones or in the " depths of your spirit . " The problem here is not with the Spirit speaking to Gods people , but hearing direction from God apart from Scripture and yet on par with Scripture . ( Tim Challies and Michael Horton have carefully criticized this problem in their reviews of Jesus Calling . ) <p> Regrettably , then , Worthingtons understanding of prayer runs the risk of bypassing the primary means for divine encouragement and direction . The Word of God is the only word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a believer . But we are told in Scripture that Gods written Word is better , " more confirmed , " than any audible message ( 2 Pet . 1:16-21 ) . <p> Worthington does makes true statements about the Christian life and even appropriately applies Scripture at times . But , even then , she generally maintains a 30,000 foot view of the Bible that leads her to misinterpret and misapply it in on a number of occasions . For example , during her chapter on " Editing , " she teaches that God edited Christs life and that his agony in Gethsemane was a struggling over a " new calling " as if crucifixion was a new idea to Christ . Yet from the Old Testament forward , Scripture is clear that Christs purpose was always to die for his people , with Christ himself speaking of his own death , burial , and resurrection from the beginning of his earthly ministry ( see Isa. 53 ; John 2:18-22 ; 3:14 ; 12:27-33 ) . Its what makes Christs willful condescension so gloriously humble ! <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to claiming Gods promises . So , when she encourages women to find their worth in God or cast their cares on him during anxious moments , Worthington seems to assume that Gods covenant promises apply to all people in the same way . This message may not be intentional . But without a ground-level view of Scripture , this kind of universal encouragement can lead to confusion and discouragement for those who do not know Christeven a distraction from their deepest need for him . <p> Why it matters <p> Maintaining a birds-eye view of the Scriptures causes the reader to miss the biblical contours that explain how God prepares his people for " breaking free of busy . " Our " God-given destiny " is " to proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light " ( 1 Pet . 2:9 ) . <p> God has given us pastors , deacons , Sunday School teachers and fellow church members to confirm his gifts and capacities he gives us so that we can glorify Christ in our calling and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow in Gods wisdom as Gods Word in Scripture transforms our hearts and minds . Its by this Word-fueled transformation we are best equipped to make life choices that free us from " crazy busy . " Then the greatest joy is realized , by using these gifts in this new-found freedom , when we all grow up together to look more and more like Jesus . <p> What now ? <p> Though the concerns with Worthingtons book are significant , it still stands that Breaking Busy offers much practical wisdom that will be useful to many women . And the reader will benefit from Worthingtons heart for others to live a fuller , more purposeful life that is pleasing to the Lord . For a believer who is well grounded in the Word , I would recommend this book to be read with discernment and appreciation for its practical and profitable insights .

@@100509336 @4709336/ <h> 4 reasons Christians should care about politics <p> During the course of a presidential campaign , it is common to hear evangelicals , especially younger ones , quip , " I 'm just not that interested in politics , " or , " Politics just are n't  my thing . " These dismissive remarks are often delivered with a veneer of piousness implying that political engagement is inherently defiled , occupying an arena unfit for those serious about the gospel . For those inundated with television ads , robo-calls , campaign mail and the overall negative tone of politics , this might be a tempting position to adopt . However , it is not a position Bible-believing , gospel-loving Christians can or should accept as congruent with Scripture . <p> The message of the gospel is that by grace through faith sinners can be reconciled with God ( Ephesians 2:7-8 ) . This message transforms individuals and enables them to lead godly lives . Mandated by Scripture ( Matthew 28:19-20 ) , Christians are charged to share the good news and disciple others in faith . <p> The gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , including how Christians engage the political process . Here are four reasons Christians should care about politics : <p> 1 . The Christian worldview speaks to all areas of life . <p> A frequently raised objection against Christian engagement with politics is that anything besides explicit preaching and teaching of the Bible is a distraction from the mission of the church . However , this is a limited understanding of the kingdom of God and contrary to examples in Scripture . <p> The Christian worldview provides a comprehensive understanding of reality . It speaks to all areas of life , including political engagement . In fact , the Bible speaks about civil government and provides examples of faithful engagement . <p> In the Old Testament , Joseph and Daniel served in civil government , exerting influence to further the flourishing of their nations . <p> In the New Testament , Jesus engaged in holistic ministry , caring for the spiritual and physical needs of people . Feeding the hungry and healing diseases were an outworking and extension of the reconciliatory message of the gospel . <p> Paul also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us do good to everyone " ( Galatians we should walk in them " ( Ephesians 2:10 ) . <p> Engaging in " good works " should include participating in the political process because of the legitimate and significant role of government . The decisions made by government have a substantial impact on people and the way we interact with them . A Christian worldview should include a political theology that recognizes every area of life must be included in the " good works " of believers , especially politics , an area with significant real-life implications for people . <p> 2 . Politics are unavoidable . <p> As " sojourners and exiles " ( 1 Peter 2:11 ) , it can be tempting for Christians to adopt a mindset that earthly governing systems are inconsequential to the task of furthering the gospel . But ask a pastor in an underground church or a missionary attempting to access a closed country if politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unnecessary luxuries but are often vital for pastors and missionaries seeking to preach and teach the gospel . <p> Augustines City of God offers guidance on this point . Believers are citizens of the " City of God , " but on this side of eternity , we also belong to the " City of Man " and therefore must be good citizens of both cities . There are biblical examples of how membership in the earthly city can be leveraged for furthering the reach of the heavenly . Pauls appeal to his Roman citizenship ( Acts 16:37 , 22:25 ) is a model of this . <p> In an American context , engaging these dual cities takes on added significance because of the words prefacing the Constitution : " We the people . " In the United States , ultimate national sovereignty is entrusted to the people . James Madison explained that the " consent of the people " is the " pure original fountain of all legitimate authority . " This reality makes politics unavoidable for American citizens who control their political future . <p> Because politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel , Christians ought to engage the political process by leveraging their rightful authority , advocating for laws and policies that contribute to human flourishing . <p> 3 . We need to love our neighbor . <p> When questioned by religious authorities on the law , Jesus explained that loving God with heart , soul and mind was the greatest commandment ( Matthew 22:37 ) . He added that second in priority was : " You shall love your neighbor as yourself " ( Matthew 22:39 ) . <p> Followers of Christ are called to love and serve their neighbors ( Matthew 28:19-20 ) . When asked about the qualifications of " neighbor , " Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan ( Luke 10:25-37 ) , indicating that irrespective of race , background , social status or occupation , neighborly love is owed . <p> In a very real sense , politics is one of the most important areas in which Christians demonstrate love to neighbor . In fact , how can Christians claim to care about others and not engage the arena that most profoundly shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty , naked , sick and lonely is important to Jesus and should be to His followers as well . Jesus said , " As you did it to one of the least of these you did it to me " ( Matthew 25:40 ) . <p> Fulfilling the biblical mandate to love neighbor and care for the " least of these " should be a priority for every believer . Again , a holistic approach is essential . Loving neighbor includes volunteering at a homeless shelter , as well as influencing laws that encourage human flourishing . Good government and laws are not negligible factors in the prosperity and freedom of a society . <p> For example , the majority of North Koreans are held in economic bondage by corrupt political forces , whereas in South Korea , citizens are given liberty and a system that encourages prosperity . The people of North Korea need more than food pantries and improved hospitals ; they need political leadership and policies that recognize human rights . Advocating for these changes in totalitarian countries is crucial for loving our neighbors in oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws that protect unborn children , strengthen marriages and families , advocate for the vulnerable , and provide opportunity for flourishing . Politics is a means of effecting great change and must be engaged by Christians who love their neighbor . <p> 4 . Government restrains evil and promotes good . <p> Government derives its authority from God to promote good and restrain evil . This mandate is expressly stated in Romans 13:1-7 . Elsewhere , Paul urges that prayers be made " for kings and all who are in high positions , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life " ( 1 Timothy 2:1-2 ) . Paul understood the need for Christian participation in government . <p> Government plays a role in the work of Gods kingdom on earth . Good government encourages an environment conducive for people living peaceably , whereas bad government fosters unrest and instability . Because of sin , the legitimate institution of government has , at times , been used illegitimately throughout history . However , numerous examples persist of Christians reasserting their influence and redeeming government to promote good and restrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin Schmidt documents Christian influence in government . Examples include outlawing infanticide , child abandonment and gladiatorial games in ancient Rome , ending the practice of human sacrifice among European cultures , banning pedophilia and polygamy , and prohibiting the burning of widows in India . William Wilberforce , a committed Christian , was the force behind the successful effort to abolish the slave trade in England . In the United States , two-thirds of abolitionists were Christian pastors . In the 1960s , Martin Luther King Jr. , a Christian pastor , helped lead the civil rights movement against racial segregation and discrimination . <p> Carl Henry rightfully stated that Christians should " work through civil authority for the advancement of justice and human good " to provide " critical illumination , personal example , and vocational leadership . " This has been the historic witness of Christians concerned about government promoting good and restraining evil . <p> Jeremiah 29:7 says : " But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile , and pray to the Lord on its behalf , for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Babylon , the prophet recognized that secular government served a legitimate purpose in Gods plan for Israel . This is still true . Today , good governments promote literacy , advance just laws , provide religious liberty and allow churches to preach and teach . Good government can serve as a conduit for the furthering of the gospel and human flourishing . <p> Christian witness in the public square contributes transcendent values about moral and ethical issues . Christian withdrawal opens a moral vacuum susceptible to influences that pressure government to move outside the purview designated by God . Politics affects government , shapes society and influences culture . Because of what the Bible teaches and the inevitability of its effect on our culture , Christians must care about politics . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182 
@@100509337 @4709337/ <h> Zika virus : What do we need to know ? <p> In May 2015 , health officials reported confirmed cases of Zika virus infection in areas of northeast Brazil . By the end of 2015 , further reports emerged regarding an increased number of Brazilian infants born with abnormally small heads and neurologic impairment . Since the beginning of the outbreak , active transmission of Zika virus has spread to other regions of the Americas , and health officials indicate that continued spread to the United States is likely . In the face of this threat , here are some basic considerations to help you understand what is happening . <p> 1 . What is Zika virus and how is it transmitted ? <p> Zika virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen currently causing outbreaks in several countries in South America , Central America , the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands . Zika is a flavivirus , which means it is in the same family of viruses as dengue , yellow fever and West Nile viruses . The primary mode of Zika virus transmission is through the bite of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vector for other tropical and subtropical viruses such as dengue , yellow fever and Chikungunya . Direct transmission of Zika virus through sexual contact has been reported , and it is also likely that pregnant women can pass the infection to infants in the womb . <p> 2 . Where did Zika virus come from ? <p> Zika virus is not a new pathogen . It was first identified in a rhesus monkey in 1947 in the Zika Forest of Uganda . Sporadic human infections occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia , and the first human outbreak was recorded on a Micronesian island in 2007 . Additional outbreaks in the Pacific Islands occurred , all of which were associated with mild , self-limited disease . <p> Beginning with the outbreak in Brazil in May 2015 , the virus was introduced into new geographic regions conducive to sustained transmission of the infection . Conditions in the newly affected areas in South and Central America are likely to lead to continued spread of the infection because the areas are home to the vector of transmission ( the Aedes mosquito ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection can proliferate . Given the likelihood of international travel among asymptomatic infected individuals and the fact that the range of certain species of Aedes mosquitoes extends into southern portions of the United States , it is probable that pockets of local transmission of Zika virus will eventually occur in certain parts of the United States . <p> 3 . What medical problems are associated with Zika virus infection ? <p> Most people who become infected with Zika virus have no discernable symptoms and are therefore unaware of the infection . About 20 percent of infected individuals will have clinically apparent disease , but even in these cases the illness is typically mild . The most common symptoms are fever , rash , joint pain and conjunctivitis . These symptoms typically begin within one week of being bitten by an infected mosquito . When symptomatic , the illness usually lasts a few days to a week and resolves on its own . In rare cases , infection with Zika virus may act as a trigger for Guillain-BarrT Syndrome ( GBS ) , an autoimmune illness characterized by muscle weakness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A noteworthy pattern emerging in some areas affected by the current Zika virus outbreak is the increase in the number of infants born with a condition called microcephaly . Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby is born with an abnormally small head , indicating some degree of impaired brain development during gestation . There are many known causes of microcephaly , including congenital infections ( infections passed from a pregnant mother to her developing child while in the womb ) , poor nutrition and certain drugs or toxins . While the increased incidence of microcephaly in areas of Zika virus outbreak indicate a possible association , it is important to note that microcephaly rates have not yet increased in all areas of outbreak . Zika outbreaks prior to 2015 did not report increases in the incidence of microcephaly . Further investigations are underway in attempt to definitively determine if there is a causal link . <p> 4 . What measures are being taken to control the outbreak ? <p> There are no specific antiviral therapies for Zika virus disease . The standard course of care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fever and pain reducing medications . Eighty percent of infected individuals have no symptoms and require no additional care . <p> No vaccine is available for the prevention of Zika virus infections in humans . In areas with active or potential Zika virus transmission , the most effective methods of preventing the spread of infection center around avoidance of mosquito bites via mechanical and chemical barriers . Mechanical mosquito barriers include bed nets , air conditioned interior spaces , screened doors and windows , as well as wearing long sleeve shirts and long pants . Chemical interventions are intended to prevent mosquito bites ( through the use of insect repellants ) and reduce the overall number of mosquitoes present in a community ( through pesticide fumigation practices ) . <p> While studies of the possible association between infection and birth defects are ongoing , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) issued a Health Advisory urging pregnant women to postpone travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus . If postponement of such a trip is not possible , pregnant women or women trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to traveling and should carefully follow all instructions on how to avoid mosquito bites . <p> 5 . How should Christians respond to the Zika virus outbreak ? <p> While the impending spread of Zika virus and the potential harm to congenitally infected infants represent real public health challenges , we should be careful to wisely consider the proposals for infection control and prevention . Commendable responses to this outbreak are marked by resolve , not panic . Yes , we should recognize the potential severity of the threat and act accordingly , but we should also refuse to allow fear to trump our core convictions of compassion and the dignity of all human life . <p> The avoidance of unnecessary travel into areas of active transmission is a prudent step in curtailing the spread of Zika virus to further areas . And yet , even if we cancel our Brazilian vacations , we would do well to take interest in the growing burden of disease and be willing to come to the aid of others in need . Even as some pray that the outbreak stays " their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with affected communities , healthcare workers and researchers to help stop the spread of infection and care for the people impacted by it . Whether serving on the field ( as many colleagues in the medical field do in various ways ) or contributing in tangible ways from afar , the point is that our response should not be primarily driven by a self-centeredness that neglects the needs of those around us , but by Christ-like compassion for the suffering of others . <p> In addition to the temptation to ignore the problem and hope it does n't  come our way , other proposals for mitigating the effects of the outbreak have the potential to raise significant ethical questions . Several countries have recommended that citizens postpone pregnancies while Zika virus continues to circulate . Some of the countries , such as El Salvador , are predominantly Roman Catholic , which potentially puts the governments recommendation at odds with the religious convictions of many people regarding birth control . <p> Even if one does not oppose all forms of birth control , it would be wise to consider whether these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control measures . These measures include birth control medications and devices that have the potential to prevent the development of a fertilized egg , as well as surgical procedures designed specifically to do away with an infant found to have a birth defect in the womb . Sacrificing the life of an offspring to avoid the possibility of infection or the prospect of living with disability is a wicked trade . The God-given dignity of human life is more valuable than having our fear of earthly suffering assuaged . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> I was 25 years old when I scored my dream jobworking as an editor on the outskirts of Washington , D.C.

But what is sad is that its also the closest many of us Christians will ever come to hearing a sermon about gluttony . <p> While many churchgoers have heard their pastors warn against the dangers of indulging in sin we almost never hear about the sin of indulgence . This wasnt always the case , for gluttony was once listed among the Seven Deadly Sins . The book of Proverbs even tells us to , " Put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony ( 23:2 ) . " Yet how many Christians today would even consider gluttony to be a sin at all ? <p> Part of the problem is that gluttony is frequently mistaken for obesity . Not all who are fat are gluttons , just as not all gluttons are fat . Gluttonya term derived from the Latin word meaning to " gulp down " is usually used in reference to over-consumption of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies more broadly . Thomas Aquinas said that , " Gluttony denotes , not any desire of eating and drinking , but an inordinate desire . . . leaving the order of reason , wherein the good of moral virtue consists . " And Chris Donato explains , <p> Two mistakes accompany most discussions on gluttony . The first is that it only pertains to those with a less than shapely waistline ; the second is that it always involves food . In reality , it can apply to toys , television , entertainment , sex , or relationships . It is about an excess of anything . <p> The true danger of gluttony is not that it will lead to flabby waistlines but that it will lead to flabby souls . Too often we separate the physical from the spiritual , forgetting that the habits of our body can have profound effects on the sanctification of our spirit . " Physical appetites are an analogy of our ability to control ourselves , " says S. Michael Houdmann . " If we are unable to control our eating habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those of the mind ( lust , covetousness , anger ) and unable to keep our mouths from gossip or strife . " <p> In my own life I can see myriad ways in which gluttony has become an idol . I have an almost worshipful relationship with food . I eat when I 'm in-between meals . I eat when I 'm in my car . I eat when Im bored . I eat when Im restless , when I 'm frustrated , when I 'm watching TV , when I 'm on the computer . I eat constantly for no other reason than that I can eat almost anytime I want for any reason , or for no reason at all . <p> But I also starve my soul by other forms of overconsumption . I binge watch Downton Abbey ( 31 hours ) and Battlestar Galactica ( 57 hours ) even though I 've already seen every episode . I stay up too late gorging on Facebook and Twitter . I play countless hours of video games , like Angry Birds or Civilization 5 . <p> I turn to Netflix instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of pausing to meditate on Scripture . I seek out a piece of fried bread instead of seeking the Bread of Life . I fill my life with comfort food and comfort games , with must-see TV and must-engage social media , in order to avoid filling my time and my life with God and his holy Word . <p> " Their end is destruction , " the Apostle Paul warned , for those for whom " their god is the belly . " We worship this false idolthe god of our bellywhenever we succumb to the sin of gluttony . We replace the focus on the Lord with a focus on our own indulgences . We make a god of our belly and allow our souls to turn softer than the creme filling in our Twinkies . <p> Fortunately , there is a simple solution : increasing our appetite for Jesus . To cure our gluttony we need to constantly ask God to , " Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love , that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him . " <p> Since we can never get enough of Gods love , we can feast freely without fearing we will become overfull . If we are to be gluttons , let us gorge on the gospel and Gods glory . Let our desire be for God alonefor that alone is the only desire for which we can never overindulge. 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

" <p> Paul tells us that prayer is the pathway to guarding our hearts and minds with the peace of God . Peace comes as a comfort rooted in our trust in God that is expressed in the process of prayer . So , guarding your heart is the result of clear communication . <p> It begins with prayer to God ( as Paul lays out in Philippians 4:6-7 ) and overflows into communication with the other person .

Instead of depending on your own understanding and priorities for the relationship , you must seek Gods heart . <p> Third , hearts become unguarded when there is poor communication about the relationship . This can include poor communication with God in prayer or poor communication with the other person in discussion . If you are too afraid to talk to either of them about an aspect of your relationship , then you probably shouldnt be involved in it . <p> Why do you guard your heart ? <p> To understand why you should guard your heart , you must understand what Israel would have understood Solomon to be saying in Proverbs 4:23 .

That 's why he instructs Israel to guard the heart ( who you are ) because the wellspring of life ( what you do ) flows from it . Therefore , it is essential for you to guard your heart in dating because what you do in a dating relationship flows from who you are in a dating relationship . <p> Most books on dating treat the idea of guarding your heart as if it merely involves protecting yourself from too much intimacy with someone of the opposite sex .

Let 's be honestpeople like rigid boundaries over seeking the Lord because it seems easier ; that is , until you realize it does n't  work . <p> Am I saying that building boundaries into a relationship in order to guard your heart is wrong ? No . What I am saying is that these boundaries should flow from your relationship with God . Paul tells us in Philippians 4:6-7 that prayer , not boundaries , is the means of guarding your hearts . How you approach your relationship with God is going to directly impact how you approach your relationship in dating . <p> How long do you guard your heart ?

In fact , if it werent for a Golden Retriever named Rusty that I got for my children in 2004 , I might never have made my journey toward animals . Rusty was the dog everyone should haveloving , playful , and eager to please . He was no Lassie , but he was plenty smart . Before long , Rusty was part of the family . <p> Rusty made a convert out of me . He taught me that there are no bad dogs , only bad owners who make dogs , and many other animals , bad . Animals do what they do . They are innocent even in their cruelty because they have no concept of morality . Morality is the territory of humans . We have the knowledge of good and evil , and we can choose between the two . <p> Rusty taught me that animals deserve my respect and care . He helped me understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teaching of the Bible about animals from the perspective of my relationship with Rusty , I gained a new appreciation for all animals . <p> The Bible teaches us that God created animals . They are n't  the product of happenstance or fortuitous natural processes any more than humans are . Genesis 1:24-25 says God created the animals , from the beasts of the earth to the creeping insects . Scripture even tells us that the breath of life resides within them ( Gen. 7:15 ) . By virtue of our creation in the image of God , we humans are uniquely special in comparison to all of creation , but that does not mean the rest of creation has no value to God or that he does n't  enjoy it . <p> When God created animals , he declared their creation to be " good " ( Gen. 1:25 ) . At the conclusion of the creation account in Genesis 1 , God looked at " all he had made " and declared it " very good " ( v. 31 ) . Creation was " very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to humans . Humans are the crowning achievement of Gods creative activity , and as his image bearers , we possess something of the divine that nothing else in creation possesses , but we should not let that truth cloud our appreciation for the rest of creation or diminish our responsibilities toward it . <p> Here , I offer ten biblical truths about animals that should affect how we think about them and how we treat them . <p> 1 . God communicates with animals <p> This is the best explanation for the migration of the animals to Noahs ark . In Genesis , God told Noah to build an ark in order to save himself , his family , and the land-dwelling creatures from the coming flood . However , he did n't  tell Noah to go out and round up the animals . He told him to bring them into the ark ( Gen. 6:19 ) , which meant to simply receive them . When it was time for the flood to begin , the text says the animals " went into the ark to Noah " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of the animals is that God drew them to the ark . God communicated with them directly , and they responded . <p> Another example of God communicating with animals can be found in the experience of the prophet Elijah . When Elijah fled from Ahab , king of Israel , he went to an area east of the Jordan River . The Bible says God commanded ravens to bring him food while he was there , and they did ( 1 Kings 17:4-6 ) . <p> These examples do n't  tell us that God is in regular communication with the animals , but they make clear that such communication has occurred . It is certainly plausible that God interacts with animals more than we realize . <p> 2 . God cares about the well-being of animals <p> We often quote Matthew 10:29-31 to emphasize Gods concern for humans . In this passage , Jesus helped his listeners grasp the extent of Gods concern for them : If God cares about the death of a common bird , he certainly cares about the needs of humans . That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gave us insight into Gods attitude toward animals . True , humans are " more valuable " than a common little bird , but Jesus did n't  say that animals have no value to God . In comparison to humans , the little sparrow has little value , but God still values the life of that little sparrow enough to be moved by its death . <p> It is n't just that God notices the sparrows death , like one might notice that the wind is blowing . Jesus wanted his listeners to understand that God is emotionally invested in that sparrow . He cares about what happens to it ; he just cares more about what happens to people . Once we acknowledge that God is emotionally invested in birds , i.e. , animals , as well as humans , we are now talking only about a difference in the degree to which he is , not whether or not he is . <p> The story of Jonah also offers insight into Gods concern for animals . After Jonah preached and the people of Nineveh repented , Jonah expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the people . In confronting Jonah about his hard-hearted attitude , God reminded Jonah that not only have 120,000 people been spared , " many animals " were also spared ( Jonah 4:11 ) . The well-being of these animals mattered to God . <p> In addition , Scripture teaches that God is personally involved in feeding the animals . Psalm 104:14 is instructive here . It says God " causes " the grass to grow for the cattle . The Hebrew text uses the causative form of the verb " to grow " to reveal this . God is n't simply passively watching nature take care of its own . Verse 21 continues this theme when it says the young lions " seek their food from God . " Pulling these individual examples together , the psalmist speaks of animals in general , saying , " They all wait for You ( God ) to give them their food in due season " ( v. 27 ) . <p> 3 . God enjoys animals <p> In Psalm 104:31 , the psalmist declared , " Let the Lord be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that God has created , but it is preceded by a long description of Gods interaction with animalswild goats , rock badgers , beasts of the forest , young lions , animals both small and great ( see vv. 18-30 ) . In a few more verses , the psalmist used this same word translated " glad " to describe his own joy in God . He said emphatically , " I shall be glad in the Lord " ( Ps. 104:34 ) . <p> It is n't difficult to fathom that animals bring God joy when we consider the joy we get from watching our own children . We even enjoy watching animals with whom we have no creative connection . Given that , it is understandable that the one who created all things would enjoy them . <p> 4 . Animals reveal Gods sovereignty <p> When Job complained that God had mistreated him , God pointed to creation to help Job understand his sovereignty . Animals figure prominently in his response to Jobs attempted indictment . God reminded Job that it is he who provides for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in creation ( Job 39:6 ) . God also pointed out that he is more powerful than the feared Behemoth and Leviathan by the very fact that he is their creator ( Job 40:19 ; 41:10 ) . While they may be beyond Jobs reach , they are not beyond Gods . <p> In response , Job acknowledged Gods sovereignty . He said , " I take back my words and repent in dust and ashes " ( Job 42:6 ) . The fact God used examples from the animal world to convince Job of his sovereignty suggests strongly that this is part of Gods intended purpose for his creation of animals . God has built wonder into animals , and by design , they point humanity to him as the great and only sovereign . <p> 5 . Animals bring glory and praise to God <p> In Psalm 148 , the psalmist called on everything to praise the Lord . He included in this call sea monsters , beasts , cattle , creeping things and birds ( vv. 7 , 10 ) . The final verse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that has breath praise the Lord . Praise the Lord ! " ( Ps. 150:6 ) . Even though they do n't  do so with words , animals still bring glory and praise to God . <p> By their very existence animals : ( 1 ) Point to God as creator . Animals are as much the product of Gods creative energy as any other part of creation . ( 2 ) Point to God as love . God loves life so much he creates it in seeming endless variety . ( 3 ) Point to God as designer . Animals fill a crucial part of the symbiotic relationship between all of creation . ( 4 ) Point to God as artist . Animals are a living display of the natural beauty God has built into creation . <p> 6 . Animals are reasoning creatures <p> Some deny that animals are capable of reasoning . They prefer to credit instinct for their decision making skills . They believe that animals are " as smart as they need to be " to survive . I believe this is simply not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have witnessed my dogs on many occasions trying to communicate with me . They make up for their lack of language by finding other ways through their reasoning abilities to communicate their will . <p> In the Bible , God reveals animal intelligence through the unusual encounter of Balaam with his donkey ( Num. 22:21-33 ) . In that incident , the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way and moved aside . Balaam became angry with the donkey because it would n't obey him . Yet the Angel of the Lord credited the donkeys quick thinking for Balaams deliverance . He declared , " The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times . If she had not turned aside from me , I would surely have killed you " ( v. 33 ) . The donkey recognized the danger and made a decision to get out of the way of the Angel , whom Balaam could n't even see . <p> Furthermore , we have all seen animals use tools to get food . They do n't  need to use tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of tools , but they have the reasoning capacity to know that a tool will help them get food . Also , we have all seen animals run from danger . How does an animal know its in danger ? It must understand something about life in order to seek to protect itself . We credit reason for human responses to avoiding danger . Why wouldnt we credit animals with reason when they do the same thing ? <p> We can not completely eliminate the concept of instinct as we think about animals , but at the same time , we should n't rule out the evidence that animals are also capable of reason . <p> 7 . Animals may have a more acute awareness of spiritual reality than we realize <p> The incident of Balaam and his donkey brings into focus another insight about animals . It reveals that it is possible for animals to see angels ( Num. 22:21-33 ) . In that incident , Balaam was spared death at the hands of the Angel of the Lord because Balaams donkey " turned aside " when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel of the Lord revealed his presence to the donkey . It tells us simply that the donkey saw the Angel . <p> Humans see angels when the angels want to reveal themselves . The donkey saw the Angel of the Lord without his self-revelation . In fact , judging from the Angels comments to Balaam ( see v. 33 ) , the donkey was actually acting contrary to the Angels intentions . We could understand it if the Angel said he wanted the donkey to help Balaam avoid the fate he had planned for him . But the text does not say that . A plain reading of the text suggests that the donkey was actually frustrating the plan of the Angel . The donkey saw the Angel without the Angels assistance . <p> This conclusion gains further support when we see that the Lord had to empower the donkey to speak ( v. 28 ) . If Moses recognized the need to tell the reader the Lord empowered the donkey to speak , he could just as easily have said the Lord enabled the donkey to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us that . <p> While we should not attempt to develop a major doctrine around this single event , it still raises significant questions about our understanding of the relationship of animals to the spiritual world . <p> 8 . Animals have the capacity to enjoy life <p> The psalmist was lighthearted when he described the joy animals feel . In Psalm 104 , he said God formed the sea creature Leviathan " to play " in the sea ( v. 26 ) . The Hebrew word translated " play " occurs fairly regularly in Scripture . King David used this word to describe his celebration as the ark of God was being brought to Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 6:21 ) . He was ecstatic . The psalmist said this beast of the sea can also be ecstatic . <p> The book of Job supplies additional insight . There , God , himself , described the joy animals experience . He mentioned the ostrich flapping its wings " joyously " ( Job 39:13 ) , and the beasts of the field " playing " in their surroundings ( Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We have all seen animals playing . The testimony of Scripture and our own experience remind us that animals are more than automatons driven by instinct . They are beings with the capacity for joy . <p> 9 . Animals teach us about the nature of justice <p> In Robert Bolts play , A Man for All Seasons , Sir Thomas More delivers a brilliant summation of Gods purpose for creating the angels , animals , plants , and humanity . Regarding animals , he observes God created them " for their innocence . " It is difficult to find a better description of animals than this . Animals appear to lack the capacity for moral reflection . They simply do what they do . Scripture supports this understanding . It was humans who ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , not animals ( Gen. 3:1-7 ) . <p> This observation of animal innocence is not only important for our understanding of animals . It also helps us understand our sense of justice . When we ask why we are offended by cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate sense within us that is repulsed by wanton violations of their innocence and vulnerability . This recognition helps us understand some of our motivations for our criminal justice system . When we punish acts of aggression against our fellow humans , we are responding to violations of their innocence and vulnerability . Such violations should be punished . Our sense of justice demands it . <p> Furthermore , we learn about divine justice from animals . Israels biblically mandated practice of substitutionary atonement provides this lesson . Scripture teaches that rebellion against God is sin . Gods holiness demands a penalty in response to this rebellion . In other words , God requires justice . Either the guilty person or an acceptable substitute must answer for human sin . God created the sacrificial system in Israel to help his people understand this reality . He commanded that this system regularly kill innocent animals in order to satisfy the demands of his divine justice ( Lev . 16:1-34 ) . The innocent animals would bear the sin of the people . This bloody display served as a symbol for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer himself as the true , eternal , substitutionary sacrifice for the sin of all humanity ( Rom. 3:21-26 ; 2 Cor. 5:21 ; Heb. 10:1-18 ) . <p> 10 . Animals belong to God <p> Psalm 24:1 states without reservation " The earth is the Lords , and all it contains . " This fact is repeated regularly in Scripture . While God commanded the first man and woman to " rule over " every living thing ( Gen. 1:26 ) , He was not relinquishing ownership of every living thing . <p> In fact , God did not relinquish ownership of anything ( Col. 1:16 ; Rom. 11:36 ; Heb. 2:10 ) . He put the man and the woman in the Garden to " cultivate it and keep it " ( Gen. 2:15 ) . He even gave humans authority over it , and after the Flood , he gave us all of the rest of creation for food . But none of this assignment of authority and power included a transfer of ownership . Humans serve a stewardship role toward creation , not an ownership role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is intended to include an attitude of respect ( Lev . 25:3-5 ; Num. 35:33 ) . The animals are subject to humans , but they are not ours to do with as we will . They belong to God ( Job 41:11 ; Ps. 50:10-11 ) . <p> Conclusion <p> The reader will no doubt notice that most of my biblical references are from the Hebrew Scriptures . When one looks to the New Testament for evidence of the place of animals in Gods creation , there is less to work with . There are good reasons for this dearth . First , the New Testament is built on the revelation before it . It assumes the foundation of the Hebrew Scriptures . So , there is no need to repeat what has been previously stated . Unless the New Testament affirms that its teachings supplant the teachings of the Hebrew Scriptures , we are to accept their infallible guidance and truth as we do those of the New Testament . Second , the New Testament is dealing principally with the establishment of the church . The writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this endeavor . <p> Drawing from this entire biblical witness , we can make some important conclusions about how to think about animals . First , we must recognize that animals may very well be co-inheritors with us of the new creation . When we consider that animals were part of Gods original design for his creation , it is plausible that they are part of his eternal design , as well . In his letter to the church at Rome , the Apostle Paul said all of creation was subjected to the corrupting effects of the Fall and that the day is coming when it too shall be freed from this corruption ( Rom. 8:18-22 ) . There is no reason to suspect that animals are not part of this vision of a redeemed creation . The prophet Isaiah saw a day when humans and animals would live once again in perfect harmony ( Is. 11:6-9 ) . The Apostle Paul may be telling us this is a vision of eternity , not only of the millennium . <p> I 'll confess that I am not one who believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  see any biblical evidence for this . But given these statements from Isaiah and Paul , we should give more consideration to the place of animals in eternity . They may not be the same animals we have come to love in our lifetimes , but it seems they have a future beyond the Fall . Whether we are talking only about the millennium or about all of eternity , animals deserve to be treated with the dignity such a future bestows . <p> Second , we must lose some of our anthropocentric view of creation and replace it with a theocentric view , where God is engaged with all of creation , not only humanity . While a theocentric view of creation should not cause us to equate humans with the rest of creation , it should cause us to treat the rest of creation with more respect . God is interested in all of creation , not only humans . After the Flood , he covenanted with all flesh on the earth , including the animals , never again to destroy the earth with a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into a covenant with the animals tells us something of his love for them . We , therefore , should be more concerned about all of creation , including animals , too . <p> Third , these biblical truths about animals mean we should be engaged in activities that help the rest of creation fulfill Gods design and interest in it . Possibly , we do n't  know all that means . For example , who would have guessed that God would use the ravens to feed his prophet ?

God withdrew us from that competition when He gave Moses the Second Commandment ( Exodus 20:4-6 : " You shall not make for yourself a carved image " ) . The result was that Israel entirely conceded the arena of religious statues to all of the surrounding idolatries ( or , at least , was supposed to do so ) . The same was true for Christians , who confronted Roman paganism not by building their own temples and statues but by championing the divine plan to make each believer a temple of the Holy Spirit and a monument to the power of the gospel . The Roman pagans had all the statues and all the monuments . Christianity still won , and won decisively . I 'll take a living God over a dead statue any day of the week . <p> 2 .

Formulating a Christian response to idolatry is not a difficult task . This is one of those cases in which WWJD works out to be a pretty solid bit of guidance .

Preaching from Isaiah 44:9-20 or Acts 17:22-31 will give you a good exegetical basis for proclaiming an appropriate Christian response .

Bush <p> I just finished reading Jon Meachams magnificent biography of the 41st President of the United States , George HW Bush , a book I thoroughly enjoyed , from cover to cover . <p> Bushs election to the presidency in 1988 was the first presidential election I paid attention to . I was ten years old , already a budding politics and history nerd . We huddled around the radio in our family room that November night ( our family did not own a TV ) and waited to hear the returns . <p> George HW Bush was in the arena during much of the pivotal history of the 20th century . His father , Prescott Bush , was a U.S. Senator . He volunteered to fight in World War II and became a fighter pilot whose plane was shot down over Chichi Jima . He and three others survived , but not after he finished his bombing mission , parachuted into the waters of the Pacific , and was rescued by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara , built an oil business in Texas , then got involved in politics . He won a seat in Congress , then ran for the Senate and lost . He served in a variety of roles in government : Ambassador to the United Nations , Ambassador to China , and Director of the CIA . He was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee . He was considered for the Vice-Presidency twice : in 1968 with Richard Nixon and in 1974 with Gerald Ford . He ran for President in 1980 , lost to Ronald Reagan , and then was asked by Reagan to join the ticket . He served as Vice-President for 8 years before seeking the presidency and winning in 1988 . Born just after World War I , Bush lived through the Great Depression , World War II , Korea , Vietnam Korea , the turbulent 60s , Watergate , the assassinations of JFK , RFK , MLK , the fall of Communism , the Gulf War , the Iraq War , 9/11 , the digital age , and much more . He saw two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is a fascinating prism through which we can study the 20th century . <p> Reading this book was a pleasure on many levels . I enjoy , thoroughly , biographies , especially political ones . But more than this , I came away with several reflections on leadership and life . I thought I 'd share a few with you . <p> 1 ) You do n't  have to be a monster to be a consequential leader . There is a narrative , fueled by the stories of men like Steve Jobs , that to be effective , one must be a tyrant : thoughtless , selfish , ruthless . Even among Christian leaders , this idea exists and is rewarded . George H.W. Bush demonstrates that you can lead at the highest levels of society and still be a kind and decent man . For Bush , his decency was something he was taught by his mother , but nurtured throughout his life by discipline . He refused to hold grudges , to settle scores , or to not be kind . He was prudent and deferential , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served and for the good of the nation . <p> As I read this book , it reminded me of the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians : gentleness . Its a similar trait described in Titus 1 and 1 Timothy 3 . Gentleness , is not weakness . Its not avoiding conflict or about being nice . Its a steady disposition and a genuine concern for those who are affected by your decisions . Its modesty , a kind of selflessness . Today common decency is neither taught nor rewarded . This is why men who are both powerful and gentle are hard to find . But for Bush , a man who led well , it was in abundant supply . <p> 2 ) Sometimes your best and most lasting work will go unnoticed . When the history of the end of the Cold War is retold , giants like Ronald Reagan , Margaret Thatcher , Lech Walesa , Pope John Paul II , Vaclav Havel and others are often ( rightly ) given credit for its demise . What goes unnoticed , however , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was reunified and during his presidency when many former Soviet Republics gained their freedom . The end of the Cold War could have had a bloody end , but for Bushs careful diplomacy and steady leadership . <p> Bush also assembled a coalition to push Saddam Hussein out of Iraq and presided over a hugely successful mission . His refusal to take out Saddam at the time seemed weak , but , in historys hindsight , seems prudent given the struggles the U.S. has had in restoring stability in a post-Saddam Iraq . <p> There were many other similar crises over which Bush presided , both at home and abroad , that went unnoticed , but were evidence of careful leadership . And yet , until recently , most have not considered Bush a consequential president . He s often lost when people discuss the 20th centurys greatest leaders . This reminds me that much of good leadership is done behind closed doors , when nobody is paying attention , on matters that often seem unimportant to the outside world . If our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we do , by being noticed , well not lead well . But if we are committed to faithfulness , wherever we lead , our leadership will have more lasting impact . <p> 3 ) You can lead well and still love your family . To study the Bush family is to study a family deeply devoted to each other . George Bush often wrote touching notes to his children during times of crisis . He was , for them , a source of encouragement and strength . His kids adore their father . To hear Bush talk of his love for Barbara ( He calls her " Bar " ) is to hear a husband who deeply loves his wife , over the many seasons of life . George HW Bush was an ambitious , accomplished man and yet he did n't  sacrifice his kids . <p> As a husband and father , reading this book was , at times , sobering and convicting . It forced me to think through my faithfulness to my family and to ask hard questions of myself . Sadly , many good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be this way . It should n't be this way . <p> 4 ) There is no substitute for experience in leadership . It struck me , as I read this book , that George HW . Bush may be the last President elected with a long record of public service . He may have , arguably , been the most experienced person to hold that office . This served him well , especially on foreign policy as he leveraged relationships with government leaders he had forged over decades . <p> Today such a resume is considered a liability , not just for Presidents but for leadership positions at all levels , including in the church . We are a culture obsessed with youth , with charisma , with raw talent . There is something to be said , of course , for young leadership . Maturity is not always tied to age . Sometimes young leaders have a prudence and vision beyond their years . Paul told Timothy to not let the church he served " despise his youth " ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ) . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singular desirable quality in those we seek to lead us . In those moments of crisis , when leadership is difficult , those whove led before often have a reservoir of life experience to guide them . <p> 5 ) Men plot and plan , but God is gathering history to himself . I have this thought after every Presidential biography I read . Reading history only reinforces to me the sovereignty of Christ over history . Bushs life is no exception . But for a few inches left or right , he could have been killed while being shot down at sea in World War II . Had Richard Nixon made Bush a White House staffer instead of ambassador to the U.N , Bushs career may have ended with Watergate . But for a few choices and mistakes and turns , he might have defeated Ronald Reagan and won the presidency in 1980 . Had former President Gerald Ford accepted the offer to be Reagans running mate in 1980 , Bush , the second choice , may not have ever been elected president 8 years later . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , we may have never known who George HW . Bush is . <p> The sovereignty of God , over history , shouldnt drive us to either fatalism or passivity . We should live out our God-given callings with intentionality and purpose , but knowing that in the swirl of history , both in the world and in our own personal lives , there are no accidents and no coincidences . Nothing happens that does n't  pass through the hands of a wise and perfect God . <p> Update : I cant believe I forgot to mention that Ive been to the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library in College Station , Texas on the campus of Texas A&amp;M . I highly recommend the visit . 43183 @qwx903183 43182 @qwx903182

Or , imagine if you could only see things as gray ? This is actually a reality for many people . <p> Color blindness is the inability to see certain colors as they are . The most severe form of color blindness is achromatopsia ; this is when everything appears to be gray . Though you might think its a rare occurrence , about one in 10 men have some form of color blindness , according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine . Unfortunately , this condition can limit job opportunities , and because it is typically associated with additional eye problems , it can affect ones way of life in general . <p> Those who are color blind are unable to take in the varied beauty of Gods creation , and yet , many well-meaning people aspire for all of us to be color blind . <p> Diversity does n't  require color blindness <p> People will often say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " color blind . " Many times , its their way of expressing that they see all people as just that , people . Everyone is the same , and they never differentiate between people based on color . I 've also heard it as a defense against racism , " I 'm not racist . I love all people . Actually , I 'm color blind . " But I 'd like to suggest that we are not color blind , we do n't  need to be color blind , and we should strive to not be color blind . Instead , I 'd like to suggest that we embrace being color smart . <p> Color smart celebrates Gods design <p> Being color smart enables us to see people as made in the image of God just like us , while also acknowledging the beauty of our differences . As image bearers , we are all the same . In other words , God does n't  discriminate against certain people groups in his design . Regardless of ethnicity , we are all created equally to reflect aspects of our Creator God . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not all the same in regards to skin color , interests , likes , gifts and desires . He has created us different for a purpose , namely his glory . So , instead of striving to be color blind , let 's be color smartrecognizing the differences in others in such a way that expresses genuine interest in and love for our neighbor . <p> To further emphasize this point , here are five reasons why we should see the beauty of Gods creation in the people he has created . <p> 1 . God created us in his image . We are all made in the image of God ( Gen. 1:26-27 ) . No , we do n't  look like him ( John 4:24 ) , but we reflect something about his character . So , if we are his image bearers , we should embrace different ethnicities instead of pretending there are n't  any . Our differences are purposed by God for his glory ! <p> 2 . Racial and ethnic color blindness ignores reality . Its simply not realistic to be color blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have no desire to ) erase the fact that I am how God made me . There is no hiding my milky-brown , freckled skin . I am who I am . When I walk in a room and I am the only black woman , its obvious . There 's no benefit in pretending . What I 'm not saying is that we need to act awkward around each other . If we 've embraced that God has created us as equals , there 's no need for that . If someone who is culturally or ethnically different from you comes around , it is unrealistic , unhelpful and possibly unloving to pretend that you do n't  notice . <p> 3 . Our culture and background affect who we are . Our culture is often tied to the color of our skin . Denying this diminishes Gods wisdom in ordaining our culture and background ( Acts 17 ) . As Christians , we know that our ultimate identity is in Christ ( 2 Cor. 5:17 ) , and we have the hope that Christ will redeem our history . Yet , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture affect who we are . To really get to know someoneand thus love your neighbor as yourself ( Mark 12:31 ) means getting to know their unique background and how it has shaped them . If we erase color , we potentially forfeit a deeper relationship with someone who 's not like us . <p> An unfortunate side effect of not appreciating our neighbors culture is a general misunderstanding when we see racism in the news or in our backyards . We can minimize the outrage we see and think , Are n't  we past this ? Because we have tried to move past color , we 've minimized our genuine cultural differences , and this can lead to a lack of mercy and grace toward those who think differently than us . <p> 4 . All nations are found in Scripture . One of the most important reasons to recognize the precious colors of Gods creation in human beings is that he does n't  erase these distinctions in Scripture . The oft-quoted passage in Revelation reveals to us that not only will there be many colors when Jesus returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rev. 5:9 ; 7:9 ) . This is a beautiful picture of the reconciliation of the Lordfirst in reconciling us to himself , then us to one another . Heaven will be filledgloriously ! with people of all colors . <p> 5 . The gospel is for all nations . The most important reason to be color smart is that the gospel is for all nations ! God celebrates his creation and redemption of all people . The Bible tells us that we sinned greatly , putting everything out of order ( Gen. 3 ) . Throughout all of Scripture , God is working toward the redemption of all people through Christ ( Gal . 3:8 ; Eph. 2 ) . And he will be glorified on that last day when all nations are worshipping together because it will be a fulfillment of his promise to redeem every tribe , tongue and nation . <p> So , instead of pretending like we are color blind , let 's celebrate Gods creation and be color smart . Instead of pretending like there are no differences , let 's get to know one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to ignore how God uniquely designed us . When we celebrate our differences , I believe we reflect what God has demonstrated in his Word . <p> This month ( and all year ! ) , find someone not like you and learn about their joys , upbringing , food likes , faith , trials , loves , family , and culture . Enjoy their friendship , and remember they 're a person made in the image of Godjust like you . Refuse to be color blind , open your eyes and enjoy the different shades of Gods beauty reflected in your neighbors. 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Earlier today , the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a resolution condemning the movement known as the " alt-right .

But we need to take a closer look . He goes on to say , " But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean fruitful labor for me ; and I do not know which to choose " ( Phil . 1:22 ) .

What the Corinthians once were , we now are . The fit is close enough to be useful . <p> Rejecting the cross in Corinth <p> Savages argument begins with an account of Corinthian social life and values , because these factors explain why Pauls ministry and message would be rejected by unregenerate pagans . The latter were treating temporal goods as ultimate ends , trying to surpass each other in wisdom , eloquence , power , wealth , beauty and victory . Life was a contest , a zero-sum , shame-and-honor struggle , where victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . <p> Thus , we should have expected the Corinthians to despise Pauls message of the cross , dismissing it as idiocy .

How could Pauline weaknesscarrying in his body that kind of deathbe a conduit of supernatural power ? As arrogant social-climbers , the Corinthians rejected Paul and his message , favoring the alpha men who offered to replace the Apostle and preach a cross-free gospel . <p> But it gets worse . Pauls gospel implies that love is cruciform and that boasting is allowed only if its object is Christ . We must do more than put ourselves second : we come in last , after the Lord himself and everyone else , too . In this sense , discipleship inverts the worlds core-values , leaving no room for self-regard or pride .

Does sexuality have any purpose ? People should be cared for until their lives end .

Thus , we should expect to find similar failings outside the church , this time going deeper and doing more damage . <p> Why , then , do parents kill their imperfect children in the womb , children developing without limbs or conceived at the wrong time ? Why do people get divorced so often ? Why do they use their votes to seize other peoples money ? Why do they want to define marriage as " state-sponsored PDA " ? How did " No " become so offensive ?

@@100509354 @4709354/ <h> A word to pastors preaching in the aftermath of the SCOTUS decision <p> I am a pastor . I preach the word of God regularly to the congregation that I serve . And this morning I am thinking about and praying for other pastors across the country who will be ascending the sacred desk tomorrow morning to deliver a message to Gods people . Some of them are wondering what to say in the wake of a Supreme Court decision that seems designed to marginalize our ancient faith . I do n't  know that I have anything particularly earth-shattering to offer here , but I would like to encourage you pastors in several specific ways as you prepare . <p> 1 . Be biblical <p> " We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord " ( 2 Cor. 4:5 ) . We are not the subject matter of our own sermons . Jesus is . And we do not know him by what we have conjured from our own imaginations . We know him as he has revealed himself to us in the scriptures . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , we have to proclaim to them the bookbecause the book testifies about him ( John 5:39 ) . <p> Pastor , your job tomorrow is unchanged from last week . You must preach the word . That is your task . If you have n't been doing that up until now , that needs to change . Right now . Make it your aim to preach verse by verse , passage by passage , through as many books as you can until they cart you off or lower you in the dirt . Teach them the whole counsel of God and do n't  hold anything back ( Acts 20:27 ) . They need all of it , and your job is to give it to them . <p> You cant deliver it all in one sermon , so do n't  try . But you can start this work with one sermon . Let tomorrow be that day , and do n't  ever look back . I promise that you wo n't run out of material . <p> 2 . Be courageous <p> The apostle Paul tells us to preach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Tim . 4:2 ) . That means that you deliver the goods when its popular and when its not . It means that we preach Christs word when people congratulate us and when they actively oppose us . And as the Supreme Court and public opinion are going against us , there is no question that you will face oppositionmaybe even from some in your own congregation . But do n't  be cowed by that . <p> Right now , your people need you more than ever . They are facing difficulties at work because of their unpopular views on marriage . They are facing ostracism from certain circles that they have always run in . The social pressure to conform is ratcheting up on them . That 's what the folks in my church are facing . No doubt your people are facing the same . How will they stand if you do n't  ? <p> Gods people will rally to the truth . Take your stand . Wave the flag high so that the troops will know where to muster . Tribulation and opposition will arise , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the voice of their Shepherd . Be his mouthpiece , and they will come ( John 10:27 ) . <p> 3 . Be practical <p> When Paul commands us to " preach the word , " he also says " reprove , rebuke , exhort , with great patience and instruction " ( 2 Tim . 4:2 ) . This means that we preach in the imperative mood . We are not giving a theological lecture . We are in fact telling people in the name of Jesus what they ought to believe and to do . We are also telling them what they ought to disbelieve and repent of . That means that we know the challenges that they face and we speak directly to them . <p> We tell them to repent of sexual immorality and to put on Jesus Christ and to make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lust ( Rom. 13:14 ) . We tell them that they should expect opposition if they follow Jesus ( John 15:18 ) but that we will ultimately overcome ( John 16:33 ) . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus , to reach out to them , and to practice hospitality to them . We tell them that love is not at odds with trutheven the truths that are unpopular . Truth and love are only in tension for those who are resisting them . Real love always rejoices with the truth ( 1 Cor. 13:6 ) . <p> In short , we do not trade in theological abstraction . If you preach the Bible , your stock-in-trade is the nitty gritty . So go there . <p> 4 . Be holy <p> There is an old saying about pastors that is worth repeating here . " If your output exceeds your input , your upkeep will be your downfall . " If you are preaching a message that you yourself are n't  following , you are going to have to maintain an exterior appearance that is at odds with who you really are . And keeping that hypocrisy up cant go on forever . Ultimately , you will be exposed and discredited . <p> And so a good servant of Christ Jesus is n't just teaching the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the words of the faith and of sound doctrine ( 1 Tim . 4:6 ) . The apostle also commands us , " Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching " ( 1 Tim . 4:16 ) . That means its not just your teaching that has to be right . You have to be right . You have to have integrity . <p> Pastors , one of the greatest gifts you can give to your congregation is your personal holiness . Do not neglect this . John Calvin said it this way , <p> There are two things of which a good pastor should be careful ; to be diligent in teaching , and to keep himself pure Doctrine will be of little avail , if there be not a corresponding goodness and holiness of life comments on 1 Tim . 4:16 . <p> There is more that can and should be said , but these are the things I will be praying for you as you preach tomorrow . 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170 
@@100509355 @4709355/ <h> Are youth sports a friend or foe of Christian discipleship ? <p> " I believe that God made me for a purpose . But he also made me fast , and when I run , I feel his pleasure . " <p> That memorable line is from the 1981 British historical drama film Chariots of Fire . It is the response Eric Liddell gives when he s confronted by his sister for neglecting his responsibilities before God to focus on competitive running in preparation for the 1924 Olympics . His response is powerful because he does n't see his athletic pursuit as neglecting God but as a means of glorifying God . Since sports were a means to a greater end of delighting in God , Liddell , a strict Christian Sabbatarian , refused to bow to international pressure to compete in the 100-meter race in the 1924 Olympics because it was on Sunday . <p> You do not have to be a strict Christian Sabbatarian to appreciate and learn from Liddell 's example . I believe that the Lords Day should be set aside for corporate worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . In my understanding , the Sabbath principle is already fulfilled in Christwho is our rest . But the Lord 's Day is a gracious gift to remind us that our lives are " in him " and should be honored until he consummates his Kingdom and ushers in eternal rest in the new heavens and earth . Whether you are a strict Christian Sabbatarian or believe the Sabbath has been fulfilled in Christ , Liddells example is instructive for Christian parents as they think about their children 's participation in sports . <p> Sports in Scripture <p> Eric Liddells sister considered all sports to be a waste of time . That notion is still around ; a seminary professor recently commented to me , " Sports are not necessary , so why waste time on ittime that could be better spent advancing the gospel ? " But , the Bible paints a different picture and is far from silent on sports and athletic competition ( Gen. 30:8 , 32:24 , Ps. 19:3-6 , 2 Sam . 2:14 , 1 Cor. 9:24-27 , Phil . 3:13-14 , Gal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the apostle Paul uses the language of sports as one of his three primary metaphors , along with warfare and agriculture , for talking about the Christian life ( 2 Tim . 2:4-7 ) . I consider sports to be a gift from God , a competitive manifestation of the performing arts , capable of displaying truth , beauty and goodness . <p> Sports gone wrong <p> But , as Christian parents , our responsibility is to teach our children to take every thought captive to obey Jesus ( 2 Cor. 10:5 ) including sports . Paul made it clear that there is something far more important than winning a perishable wreath on an athletic field ( 1 Cor. 9:25 ) . Some Christians simply pull their children out of sports altogether because they do not want to face the decisions that will inevitably arise while navigating athletic involvement and a commitment to church and Christian service . One of the problems with this shortsighted approach is that the kids playing on these teams will one day have jobs , children and other responsibilities as they serve Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters while faithfully committed to the supremacy of Christ is not a problem but a wonderful opportunity for discipleship . <p> Nevertheless , like all of God 's good gifts , sports can be easily corrupted . Some Christians make the mistake of prioritizing sports over church by reasoning that the youth sports opportunity is for a limited period of time and church will always be there . Clearly , teaching children that sports are a valid reason to neglect God is disastrous . Some parents fashion themselves as victims in dealing with these issues as though they can not set boundaries on their children 's participation . They reason as if the only options are not participating in sports at all or acting like the sports teams practice and game schedule is in charge of their children 's lives . <p> Shepherding in sports <p> The solution is simpler than many Christian parents want to believe , but it involves parental leadership , direction and conviction . The bottom line is , sports are never the problem , inadequate leadership in the home is the problem . Sports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent Christian example is instructive . He was passionately committed to excellence in athletic competition , but it was for the glory of God , and therefore his Christian conviction led him to set boundaries and gladly endure the consequence . When a Christian family is involved in sports , they should be committed and diligent participants , but they ought to draw whatever boundaries are needed up front on their child 's participation . As the father of eight children who loves sporting competition , I have had to lead my family in this way many times . <p> When you register your children to compete on an athletic team , you should clarify any boundaries that you have on their participation . For instance , all of my sons have played youth sports and we have told the leagues when we sign up that we do not play or practice on Sundays , so if a coach did not want one of our children on their team because of that , we wanted them to know beforehand . <p> Also , when my sons made All-Star baseball teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship games are on Sunday and my child would not participate on Sunday , so if they did not want him to be on the team because of that , we would certainly understand . It is good to teach your children that Christian convictions have consequences and that you will gladly face them . Too many parents are rearing their children in Christian sentimentality , which wants them to have convictions for which they never suffer . <p> In our home , we do not treat other church activities as if they are the Lord 's Day . We have biblical-theological convictions that demand setting aside Sundays , but we do not have the same approach to general church programming . We are not victims of the sports teams schedule nor are we victims of the church program schedule . Parents have the primary responsibility to disciple their children and a major part of that involves watching the choices we make . For instance , if one of my children has practice or a game during the time of a youth event , then they usually go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the commitment we 've made to the team . In other words , we do not want to use general church activities as an excuse to be lax on our commitments . We also view participating on the team and being involved as parents in the league or school as a unique mission opportunity of which we want to take full advantage . <p> I have found that if you are honest and straightforward about what you will and wo n't do based on your Christian convictions , people 's respect for you is not diminishedit is strengthened . Sports , rightly understood , are but a means to a greater end of delighting in God . Though , like all good gifts , sports can be corrupted and become an idolatrous competitor with God instead of a means to glorify him . <p> I believe that God made me for a purpose . But , he also placed me in a home that enjoyed sports , and when I played baseball , I felt his pleasure . And I unapologetically hope my children feel his pleasure through sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day . Just typing that phrase makes me feel a bit better . I mean it . Mentally and physically better .

@@100509356 @4709356/ <h> The gospel according to El Chapo <p> The most shocking thing about the capture of the most wanted man in the world , Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman Loera , is that his capture was not the most surprising event he was involved in this week . Instead , social media was aflurry over the weekend about a clandestine meeting between the world 's biggest drug kingpin and Hollywood star and activist Sean Penn , who wrote about the experience in a rambling and unlinkable ( because of the profanity and content ) missive at Rolling Stone . <p> The Rolling Stone story provides a window into the soul of one of the most ruthless and depraved men alive today . He is myth and legend , not only because of his exploits but also because of his reclusiveness . In fact , El Chapo has escaped from prison more times in the last 15 years ( twice ) than he has given media interviews ( once ) . <p> So , what can we learn from this interview about El Chapo , and more broadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's think through several aspects of the gospel according to El Chapo : <p> First , El Chapo 's interview reveals the way sinners are drawn to idolatry . In his case , that idolatry was his freedom from prison . When asked how he feels now , El Chapo says , " Lots of happiness because of my freedom . " His joy is contingent on his freedom . That 's the essence of idolatry . When people find their joy in anything but God , that 's idolatry . For El Chapo , he was driven by his freedom ; for others , they may be driven by the approval of man , business success or many other things . <p> Second , El Chapo 's interview reveals the way sinners suppress the truth in unrighteousness in a way that allows them to rationalize their sin . In El Chapo 's case , he justified drug trafficking based on his biography ( " where I grew up there was no other way and there still is n't a way to survive , no way to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And he rationalized his sin based on the inevitability of the ongoing drug trade ( " the day I do n't exist , it 's not going to decrease in any way at all " ) . <p> When Romans 1:18 tells us sinners " suppress the truth in unrighteousness , " it is teaching us that we all have a tendency to do what El Chapo has done : a man determines the way he wants to live and then builds a belief system around it to justify it . Yes , belief shapes behavior ; but behavior also shapes belief . <p> Third , El Chapo 's interview reveals the way sinners are aware of God even when they reject him . El Chapo repeatedly references God , but in a way that shows there is no genuine relationship with him . When explaining how he escaped , El Chapo says , " I never thought of hurting anyone . All I did was ask God , and things worked out . Everything was perfect . I am here , thank God . " When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I want to live with my family the days God gives me . " <p> In essence , El Chapo acknowledges the role of God 's providence in his life . He implies that God helped him escape from prison , and he realizes God numbers his days . He credits God for his deliverance from the bondage of men , but there is no evidence he credits God for his deliverance from the bondage of sin . Most lost people are just like El Chapo . They acknowledge that there is a God , but they have fashioned him in their own image to pursue their own desires . <p> Fourth , El Chapo 's interview reveals the way sinners recognize how envy drives people toward sin . The violence of El Chapo 's Sinaloa drug cartel is as notorious as their drug trafficking . Notice how El Chapo responds when asked about why there is violence : " In part , it is because already some people already grow up with problems , and there is some envy and they have information against someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what James declares about how jealousy drives sin . you fight and quarrel . " What El Chapo recognizes to be true in the fields of Mexico is true in the heart of everyone : envy leads to evil . <p> Sean Penn 's Rolling Stone story about El Chapo provides a fascinating window into the soul of the most wanted man in the world . Along the way , El Chapo 's interview answers reveal much about the false gospel of El Chapo that shows us how the lost live and justify their sin . The fact this interview appeared the next day after El Chapo 's capture reminds us how , even with drug kingpins , pride comes before the fall . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

But to be honest , there are a hundred other places I 'd rather live . I 've often dreamed of green terrain , wide-open spaces and a slower pace of life . Most days , my husband and I would prefer to raise our son in a small town anywhere east of here . <p> Its trendy to hate California . In fact , you 're considered hip if you 're from California but you loathe it enough to finally leave . The liberated find land elsewhere and recall their days of bondage with sighs of relief . <p> There are plenty of legitimate reasons to leave .

God is still at work here . This is a mission field ripe for the gospel harvest . <p> Remember Nineveh ? A " great city " of 120,000 people , it is described as evil and wicked with a wickedness that came up before the Lord . Without a second thought , God could have destroyed the city as punishment for its vileness . Indeed , he threatened tobut out of his great mercy , he decided to give the people an opportunity to repent . The prophet whom God sent to preach to the Ninevites was bitter and begrudging . To Jonah , Gods compassion " seemed very wrong , and he became angry . " But God responded , <p> " Should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh , in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who can not tell their right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe God restrained his righteous wrath long enough to care about the number of people ( and take note of their animals ) in a city that had shaken its fist in his face ? So , does God have compassion on the almost 39 million people in here too ? And what about all of us who make up the United States ? Does he have compassion on you and me ? All of Scripture gives reason to shout a resounding " Yes ! " The apostle Luke summarizes it this way : <p> From one man God made all the nations , that they should inhabit the whole earth ; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands . God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from any one of us . <p> God did n't  commission us to go and procure safe and comfortable places for ourselves where we can make a nice life . Like you , I 'm prone to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from traffic to shootings disrupts my tidy little existence . ( How dare someone hinder my happiness ! ) But God appointed us to the very places we live , to spread his fame in our corner of the world , and we do n't  have long to do it . This is going down so fast itll feel like we barely blinked when were finally with Jesus . <p> What are you doing with this blink-of-an-eye ? <p> While it may seem like I live in a God-forsaken state , I 'm seeing daily evidence to the contrary . I know many Christ-loving Californians who are living out the gospel in their families , neighborhoods and workplaces.There are even those who deeply love and care for the Muslim community here . <p> By the Spirits power , these believers are reaching out of their comfort zones , past their fears and into a godless culture to do the work of God : <p> to proclaim good news to the poor <p> to bind up the brokenhearted <p> to proclaim freedom for the captives <p> and release from darkness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our front door to remember that we live among the poor , the brokenhearted , the captives , the prisoners . But these are the very ones God came for , wrapped himself in flesh-and-blood for , lived among and suffered alongside , and died for in order to save . Not long ago I was that poor , brokenhearted prisoner taken captive by sin . And so were you . <p> When I am tempted to fear or to join in the dialogue of disgust over California and our nation , this is the strong reminder I speak to my heart : Lay down your dreams of an idyllic place elsewhere . Stop whining about the conditions . Cry out to God for our country , our states , our cities , our neighborhoods , the Muslim community . Speak the truth and love loud . <p> Because God is still here , and He is doing a great work that you do n't  want to miss . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509362 @4709362/ <h> 5 ways adult children can honor their parents <p> How should an adult child , whether married or single , relate to his or her parents ? There is a tension in Scripture between obeying the Scripture which says to " leave and cleave " in forming your own adult identity and family ( Gen. 2:24 ; Matt. 19:5 ) and obeying the Scripture which says to " honor your father and mother " ( Exod. 20:12 ; Eph. 6:2 ) . <p> Every family has its own rhythm . Every family has its own share of circumstances , from abusive to permissive to annoying , etc . So how one adult child handles his or her parents is n't necessarily a blueprint for another . Still , the Scriptures seem to indicate an intentional approach to the way we love our parents as adults . <p> This is a journey I 've travelled in the last few years . I seem to have endured the typical cycle : being cared for and nurtured by my parents as a child , distancing and forming my own identity as a teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking my generation will solve all the mistakes my parents made , and finally where I am todayappreciating my parents and figuring out how I can love them better . I 'm guessing you 've travelled a similar road . <p> As I 've pondered these important relationships , Ive come up with five general , though not exhaustive , guidelines for the way adult children should relate to their parents . here 's the list : <p> 1 . Always respect your parents , even when it is difficult . <p> By honoring , I think the Bible is saying morebut not lessthan simple respect . Im amazed at how I hear otherwise good , godly people treat their parents . Ive been in nursing homes where kids are literally yelling and berating their parents . I realize that sometimes parents are not the easiest people to love , but this is why love is something we do in the strength of the Spirit and is not something we primarily feel . <p> Your parents , regardless of their flaws , brought you into the world . They nurtured and cared for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them some respect , treat them with kindness and deference , and realize that one day you 'll be the one in their shoes . <p> 2 . Find ways to affirm the good things they did in your childhood . <p> I 'm not sure there is a generation with more childhood angst than mine . We really think our parents messed everything up so badly and that well get it just right . I thought this way up until I became a father and realized how difficult parenting could be . I understand the need for catharsis , fleshing out past hurts and using your past as context for your future . But every negative conversation shouldnt start with , " Growing up ... " <p> Instead , let 's find ways to affirm the good our parents gave us , which is likely a lot more than we think . Let 's tell them to their faces how much we appreciate their care , their love , their goodness . Parents , especially as they age , can be incredibly reflective . They question themselves : Did I do the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame . So be an encouragement to your parents . Do this often , and do it with intentionality . <p> 3 . Find ways to bless them in physical ways . <p> Sometimes this simply means going out for coffee , while listening and letting them talk . Let them tell those same stories theyve told before . Its good for them and for you . Or , this might mean lending financial support if your parents fall on hard times without lecturing them . Offer physical support like helping them clean out their home , taking them to doctor appointments , or doing an airport run . And most sacrifical of all , it might mean allowing them , in their advanced age , to stay in your home and care for them . <p> All of this , I think , is in the spirit of what the Scripture means when it says to " honor your father and mother . " We should make sure they are always well-cared for as best as we can . Its ironic how the life cycle goes , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , and now we get to return the favor and care for them . <p> 4 . Set healthy boundaries . <p> You need to set healthy boundaries with your parents so they know where the lines are between your family and them . They do n't  always know this , and if the distance is too big , they can often think they are imposing every time they come over . If the distance is too small , it can suffocate your own family . You need to " leave " your parents in the sense that you need to be financially and physically separate as best you can . And you 'll probably have to have some frank conversations at times . Again , every situation is different , so what I 'm offering is some general wisdom . <p> In setting boundaries , always , always , always do it with grace and respect ( see number one above ) . Make sure you are making your own decisions in your family , but do n't  hesitate to ask your parents for advice . You do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from it and make them feel good , as well . <p> 5 . Do n't  try to change your parents . <p> The real way to love and honor your parents is to simply love and honor them , despite their flaws and the annoying things you disliked when you were a kid . Put up with whatever it is they do that annoys you . Do it , not because you 'll get a tangible benefit , but because they are your parents , and you are to love them . Do it because the Father has loved you despite the more-than-annoying things you have done . <p> Let your parents know they are welcome in your home , that you enjoy having them around , and that they do n't  have to walk on eggshells around you . Yes , you 're way of doing family may be different ( that 's okay ) . Your parents will probably give your kids candy before dinner ( that 's okay , too ) . And you 'll find yourself wishing they were a little more this way or a tad more that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youand if you are serious about obeying and following Jesus , you 'll seek to honor and love them the best you can . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

@@100509364 @4709364/ <h> Stress and the holidays : 5 ways to remember the gospel in your parenting <p> Holidays are often the few days a year when we go home and spend the night with our parents . During college , we longed for the serenity and familiarity of home . But , in recent years , a lot of us have been pulling a family of our own in to our parents driveway , and home does n't  have quite the luster it used to have . <p> The holidays are often the few days of the year that wreck the sleep and attitude cycles of our kids that will leave us spending weeks , if not months , rebuilding . <p> Our parents ( or grandparents , in-laws , etc. ) probably wo n't send our kids back to their bedrooms when they wake up at 4:30 a.m.and we are n't  there to give instruction , because were asleep like every sane human being should be . <p> Their crazy uncle will probably say some prejudiced or insensitive thing around them that theyll attach to , and we fear theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Or maybe the kids will have a 24-hour cycle of television and movies , seemingly undoing years of our conscientious parenting practices . <p> Our kids may learn new words and new levels of disrespect for their authorities , and our relatives might disregard all rules , social and familial , all in the name of loving our kids . What 's more , they will probably get more Christmas presents than wed like them to get . Yet , as I consider how stressed out these situations make me and how I often react , I am convicted . In Christ , there 's a better , more grace-filled way to respond . Here are five suggestions to prepare you and reshape your thinking before you take off for that holiday vacation . <p> 1 . Rethink your legalism . When things do n't  function exactly like they do in our home , we can react with snide little comments that are meant to show our moral superiority as a parentcomments like : We do n't  let them watch tv when they first get up . We do n't  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 8:00 . <p> Reacting like that is indicative of the sneaky sin of legalism : passively aggressively claiming your morality as superior to anyone else . When we react this way , no one in our family will call us on it because they 're usually trying to figure out how to walk on eggshells around us . In addition , legalism wont win a single soul to our perspective . Instead , like me , there will be a still small voice in your heart that will be crying out : you white-washed tomb . <p> As believers , we ought to respond in light of the gospel . Soul-satisfied , gospel-contentment is the better testimony to all that there is a King who rules our hearts and who helps us walk in patience toward one another . <p> 2 . It wo n't kill your kids . A few grams of sugar or a few hours of television wont hurt our children in the long run . I know it seems like they 're more apt to be disrespectful because our parental authority is undermined , but three days at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about if we have to bail them out of jail when they 're 17 . <p> And we need to remember that they 're children.Theyre not perfect , and its about how we respond to their sin that makes a difference at this point in their lives . Sure , try to set them up for success , but do n't  rush to panic and frustration when they fail . The few hectic days of vacation may actually be some of your kids best memories . <p> 3 . Take the opportunity to shepherd your children . This is actually what we want as parents . We will be able to see what influence is being exerted , undo it , turn it by interpreting it for them , and train them how to handle it . Isnt this a better place for them to learn these things than in places where we do n't  know the parents and environments that are influencing our children ? <p> Anticipating these training moments , we have what we call a pep talkthe standard " who you are and whose you are " speechbefore we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things that relatives will do that we do n't  do in our home , but that we respect the wishes of others when we share their home . We remind them to be positive influences on their cousins and other family members . We remind them about the chain of command . Then , after its all said and done , we strive to help our kids interpret how they 've been influenced . <p> 4 . Youve been training them well , give your kids the space to influence others . While were there to shelter and protect our kids from the world , our families might be the only gospel-centered presence our extended family encounters until next year . Strive to make that gospel-centered exposure less about a begrudging lists of dos and donts and more about something that stands out to your family members as the only time of the year that they were able to tangibly see another worldone that made their heart skip a beat because they saw its power and joy and peace . <p> 5 . Play offense . All the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much junk food , is usually a defensive measure , designed to pacify and buy time . Instead of sitting back and letting our dissatisfaction stew , we ought to step up and play offense . <p> Start a wrestling match or play hide-and-seek outside . <p> Gather the kids and tell a fun story . <p> Draw a picture , put together a puzzle , play pretend spies or army or cowboys or whatever your " thing " is . <p> Bake some cookies , and let the kids help . <p> Take the crew on a walk around the neighborhood and point interesting things out to them . <p> Start a football game where every grownup has to stay on their knees . <p> Take the initiative to maximize your influence on the little ( and big ) people around you . Show your kids and the adults with you that you do n't  have to be uptight to be a good parentor a Christian . You can have fun , enjoy the moment and still be an intentional shepherd of your childs heart . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Christmas presents to the church nursery this week or wait a month , and whether or not your kids find a few new words for their vocabulary , remember whose you are . And remember who you are . <p> It shouldnt surprise us that our parents and grandparents and brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles are n't  fully on board with our parenting methodologies . And in a world of sin , there will be some muddying of the waters and confusion in childrens hearts . Were there to make sense of the chaos , not prevent it ; were there to undo the curse , not micro-manage it . The gospel-believing parent knows the curse is everywhere and is sometimes most evident in those we love . And there 's no room in gospel-centered parenting for a gospel-centered scrooge. 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

These churches work together through approximately 1,174 associations , 42 state conventions , and the Southern Baptist Convention to accomplish through voluntary cooperation far more than they could ever do alone . One of the ways they coordinate their efforts is through the Cooperative Program . <p> Here are five facts about one of evangelicalisms most fruitful ventures : <p> 1 . To help cover the costs of expanding ministry opportunities , leaders of the SBC proposed , in 1919 , the 75 Million Campaign , a five-year pledge campaign . The campaign was designed to fund the missions and ministries of all the state conventions as well as that of the Southern Baptist Convention . Although that program fell short of its goal , it led to the launching of the Cooperative Program in 1925 . <p> 2 .

How the Cooperative Program works : Individuals provide tithes and offerings to their local church , and the participating churches forward a portion of their undesignated funds to their state Baptist convention . During the annual meeting of each state convention , messengers from local churches across the state decide what percentage of Cooperative Program gifts contributed by local congregations stays within the state to support local missions and ministries , and what percentage is to be forwarded to the Southern Baptist Convention for North American and international missions . At the Southern Baptist Convention Annual Meeting , messengers from across the country decide how the gifts received from the states will be distributed among SBC entities . <p> 5 . Cooperating Southern Baptist churches contributed $481,409,006 in Cooperative Program contributions through their respective state Baptist conventions in 2011-2012 .

Here are the big-picture trends for religious liberty in 2014 , according to the report : <p> The rise of abuse by non-state actors .

But we have also seen an increase in the failure of governments to protect religious minorities from political parties , social organizations , and terrorist organizations . <p> The rise of anti-Semitism in Europe .

@@100509375 @4709375/ <h> Spurgeon on animal cruelty : Our treatment of animals is a spiritual issue <p> In September , the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , in conjunction with the Ethics and Public Policy Center and Clapham Group , released Every Living Thing , an Evangelical Statement on Responsible Care for Animals . <p> The statement modestly points out that it is not " a doctrinal end and it does n't  prescribe specific action . " Rather , it is intended to provide " a framework for conversation about the redemptive work of Gods grace . " This is an important conversation for the contemporary church to have . As Russell Moore explains , <p> Our treatment of animals is a spiritual issue . The Bible is clear that our being created in the image of God does not lessen our responsibility to steward the physical world well , but heightens it . This statement is a reminder that the gospel transforms our use and care of animals as we see all of Gods glory reflected in his good creation . <p> As tempting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneering visionaries , the fact is that the statement is not adding to Baptist legacy , but rather , reclaiming it . And perhaps no voice in Baptist history has weighed in more boldly or more passionately on the issue of animal welfare than the " Prince of Preachers " himself , the nineteenth century Reformed Baptist , Charles Spurgeon . <p> Following a couple of highly-publicized cases of animal cruelty , in 1873 Spurgeon published the article " A Word for Brutes Against Brutes " in the magazine he founded , The Sword and The Trowel . The article begins by describing these two horrific instances of abuse , one involving a coachman who drove a horse for miles on bloody and broken feet , the other involving a businessman who pricked out the eyes of birds with a pin to make them into better songbirds . <p> Of the first case , Spurgeon exclaimed , " If there be no law which would award the lash to such a fiend incarnate an Act ought to be passed at once , or Mr. Justice Lynch might for once be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manner . " The second case , the cruelty to birds , even tempted Spurgeon to reconsider his considered rejection of the death penalty : " if we were not averse to all capital punishment we should suggest that nothing short of a rope with a noose in it would give him his deserts . " <p> Like the evangelical reformers who came before him , including the evangelical abolitionists William Wilberforce and Hannah More , Spurgeon considered humane treatment of animals to be an issue central to both personal morality and civil society . Spurgeon was adamant that active opposition to animal cruelty is the duty of all good citizens : <p> Cruelty to animals must be stamped out . Each case must be earnestly dealt with . Where the laws are violated humane persons must undertake the unpleasant duty of prosecuting the offenders , or must at least report them to the proper authorities : and where no law exists to protect the ' unhappy victims , instances of cruelty should be reported by the press , that shame may be aroused and a right public sentiment treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake for Spurgeon . He viewed animal welfare as a matter of spiritual welfare for human beings : <p> It is not only for the sake of the creature subject to cruelty that we would , plead for kindness , but with a view to the good of the person causing the pain ; for cruelty hardens the heart , deadens the conscience , and destroys the finer sensibilities of the soul . The most eminently spiritual men display great delicacy towards all living things , and if it , be not always true that " he prayeth best who loveth best both male and bird and beast , " yet the converse is assuredly the fact , for the man who truly loves his Maker becomes tender towards all the creatures his Lord has made . In gentleness and kindness our great Redeemer is our model . . In proportion as men decline from the highest standard of goodness their sympathies become blunted , they lose delicacy , and tenderness , and becoming more selfish become also less considerate of others . He who dwells in God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were lives in it all like the soul in. the body , feeling akin with all , yea , one with all life , so that it joys in all true joy , and sorrows in all sorrow . The man of dead heart towards God has a heart of stone towards the Lord 's creatures , and cares for them only so far as he can make them minister to his own wealth or pleasure . <p> Because we in contemporary America no longer ( openly ) countenance the forms of animal cruelty that were rampant in Spurgeons day ( such as bull baiting , cock throwing , dog fighting ) , we are lulled into thinking the problem no longer persists . <p> But as a recent news story reveals , systemic animal cruelty persists in our culture today . Undercover video footage taken at one of Hormel Foods suppliers , according to the Washington Post , depicts <p> pigs being dragged across the floor , beaten with paddles , and sick to the point of immobility . By law , pigs are supposed to be rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in apparent pain while bleeding out , suggesting that they werent properly stunned . " That one was definitely alive , " a worker says . <p> Rather than taking place openly in the village square as blood sports once did , animal cruelty continues , now hidden in the recesses of industrial farming operations that produce much of the food we eat . Its easy to turn a blind eye , because it seems , like other systemic wrongs , to be a " necessary evil . " <p> Considering how neglected animal welfare issues have been within modern American evangelicalism , it is almost astonishing to learn that Spurgeon went so far as to tie true Christian conversion to care for animals , boldly declaring that , <p> . we will go the length of affirming that no person really penitent for sin can be cruel , that no man who feels the love of God shed abroad in his heart can find pleasure in giving pain , and furthermore that wanton cruelty to an animal may be that last deadening deed of i 'll which may for ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gospel . <p> Spurgeons words in the nineteenth century are just as relevant to the church in the twenty first century : how we care for and steward animals is a gospel issue because the gospel applies to every aspect of the believers life and the witness of the church body . <p> On June 18th , 2015 , Pope Francis will issue an encyclical on the environment .

She was constantly asked , " How can you let him do that ? " His mother rejected all of the advice and embraced a " no-limits because of blindness " philosophy in raising her son . According to Daniel Kish , the low expectations for what blind people can do functions to limit what they can actually do . <p> Daniel Kish concludes the TED talk he gave with an important takeaway , " We get so overwhelmed by challengesand I do too , but I was raised without fear . There were lots of things to be afraid of , but the emphasis was on facing fear . " His words are reminiscent of those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid of at first , ranging from grizzly bears to mean horses and gun-fighters ; but by acting as if I was not afraid I gradually ceased to be afraid . " Regarding this courageous and fearless mentality as a blind person , Daniel Kish says , " Running into a pole is a drag but never being allowed to run into a pole is a disaster . " <p> In the This American Life episode about Daniel Kish , he says , " Often , sighted people will jump in a half a second too soon , and they rob the blind student from that learning moment . " My son , Will , a high school senior , pointed out this podcast about Daniel Kish to me .

Merriam-Webster defines courage as , " The ability to do something that you know is difficult or dangerous . " Courage always demands a dose of danger . Our current cultural cult of safety treats willingly pursuing a difficult or dangerous task as foolish , sinful evennot heroic . G.K. Chesterton argues , " Courage is almost a contradiction in terms . It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die . ' He that will lose his life , the same shall save it , ' Matt. 16:25 . " <p> Genuine Christian courage , according to Chesterton , combines " a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness about dying . " Recklessness and self-protecting safety both have the same sinful root : self-centeredness . A culture where everyone values safety-first is a very dangerous place to live . This ought to be self-evident to the followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility count others more significant than yourselves " ( Phil . 2:3 ) . Rather than promoting human flourishing , a self-referential worldview is the root of all sin and human languishing . Taking up our cross and following him is not a call to safety-first ( Luke 9:23 ) . Love , biblically understood , is always courageous and sacrificial . Fulfilling the Great Commission demands calculated risk-taking . Biblically , safety is not a virtue , but self-sacrificial courage certainly is . It is difficult to cultivate self-sacrificial courage wrapped in cotton balls . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

Some saw his rootedness in an ordinary family and a modest town as a liability ( John 1:46 , 6:42 , 7:27 ) . But Jesus was from somewhere , and it mattered .

These longings are only ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ and his unshakable kingdom community , the church . Nevertheless , it is most natural that these longings be reflected in limited but genuine ways in our lives . <p> Sum up all things in Christ <p> Many years ago at a pastors conference I attended , someone asked , pastor and theologian Sinclair Ferguson if he had one piece of advice to offer about parenting what would it be ?

We come from somewhere , and we are a part of a family line whose sacrifices in generations past have shaped our story . Our country and our families are not ultimate , but they are important , and showing them honor is a way we honor Christ ( 1 Pet . 2:13-17 ) . <p> For many of us , our cultural story , our family story , includes allegiance to certain sports teams .

A Christian approach to sports as a spectator is to be inspired by the honed physical gifts and the determination of those who participate on behalf of his or her favorite team . <p> Christians should be challenged to offer a similar purposeful , sacrificial devotion and discipline in their vocation and endeavors . How many Christian fathers rigorously critique the job performance , dedication , and work ethic of the coach of their favorite team while simultaneously complaining about their job and excusing their own lack of work ethic and dedication ? <p> Where this is happening , the love of sports has become detached from the Christian life and transformed into a barrier rather than a bridge to worshipping Christ .

Do parents have a corner on the market of spiritual maturity ? <p> A better word <p> It would be easy for me to resent such misguided comments , except for the fact that I 've been guilty of similar words myself . When were hurting , self-absorbed or simply wanting to validate our season of life , its easy to think and speak " extra-biblically .

The Lord . So if I want to speak with wisdom , if I want faithful instruction on the tip of my tongue , I go to the Lord , the source of all wisdom . Sure , I can draw from my own life lessons and share my experiences , but " apart from the Lord , I have no good thing . " My Word-less words have no power of their own . But his Word ? His Word is : <p> " perfect , refreshing the soul <p> trustworthy , making wise the simple <p> right , giving joy to the heart <p> radiant , giving light to the eyes " ( Psalm 19 ) . <p> If I really want to refresh a friends soul , give joy to their heart , and light to their eyes , I 'll be slow to dish out my own advice and quick to direct the conversation toward the beautiful , life-giving truths of the Word . <p> For example , instead of comparing plights with a friend and telling her , " You have it so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see in her life . Or I can steer the conversation away from the differences and focus on what we share in common in Christ . <p> Or , instead of telling a single girl to be perfectly content so that God will reward her with a husband , I might share how I learned to cling to Isaiah 54 ( " your Maker is your husband " ) and 1 Thessalonians 5:24 ( " the One who calls you is faithful , and he will do it " ) . <p> Gods Word will never return empty ; it will always accomplish what God desires . Its alive and active , piercing to the joints and marrow of our souls . And if we could speak with that kind of wisdom , then it would be said of us , " Faithful instruction is on their tongue . "

@@100509381 @4709381/ <h> 5 people we should pray for ( even though we do n't want to ) <p> Let 's be honest . There are certain types of people we are conditioned , by our culture , to not like . These are the people that nobody is going to give us credit for liking , the people we tend to distance ourselves from . And yet , these are the sinners Christ most likely would have sought out to save , the people we should , at the very least , pray for . So here is a list of five people we should pray for even though we might not want to : <p> 1 . Politicians ( and really anyone in a position of power ) . Have politicians ever held a lower standing in the eyes of the American public than they do now ? There are whole cottage industries ( talk show hosts , pundits , some columnists ) who generate millions of dollars essentially mocking and criticizing politicians . Nobody will think you are cool for praying for a politician . Everybody will laugh if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Facebook . And yet there is this sneaky little prayer in the Bible that and dignified in every way " ( 1 Tim . 2:1-2 ) . <p> That 's a tough verse . Praying for politicians ( and not just in the snarky Psalm 19:8 way ) is counter-cultural . But here 's a reason we can and should pray for our government leaders , local and national : we believe that authority is granted by God . Psalm 75:6 says that power does n't  come from east or west , but from God . Romans 13 reminds us that the " powers that be " are ordained of God . So we can pray for our leaders , not only out of obedience to the Scripture , but out of a deep and abiding trust in Christ as the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always for the policies we 'd like to see implemented , but in a personal way . Let 's pray for their families . Let 's pray for their spiritual lives . Let 's pray for their blessing ( yes , you heard me right ) . <p> 2 . People who we think poorly represent the Christian faith . There is a tendency among evangelicals to distance ourselves from Christians we think poorly represent the Christian faith . I do this . I could give you a list of people whose public displays of Christianity make me want to stand and shout , " But most Christians are n't  like that . Were different . Do n't  look at them . " You have a list like this , too , do n't  you ? Isnt this pride ? Do we ever consider that perhaps its meyes mewho might be the poor display of Christian witness ? <p> Im humbled by Jesus words to Peter in Luke 22:32 , where he essentially said , " I 'm praying for you , that your faith does n't  fail . Satan wants to sift you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christ-follower who embarrassed everyone by his public displays . He s the guy who panicked and fell beneath the waves on the Sea of Galilee , he s the guy who blurted out about the tabernacles during the miracle of transfiguration . He s the guy who cut off the soldiers ear in the garden . He s the guy who denied Jesus three times . Yeah , I 'm guessing pre-Pentecost Peter is probably the guy who exemplifies , " Christian I do n't  want to be like . " <p> And yet Jesus said to Peter , patiently , " I 'm praying for you . " I 'm deeply convicted by this . Rather than mocking those Christians who I do n't  think " do it right " so I can make myself look better , I ought to pray for them . Heres what happens when we do this : Suddenly we see the humanity in people were ashamed of . Suddenly we see our own clumsy attempts to represent Christ . Suddenly we accept them as brothers and sisters rather than enemies . This is a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peters in our life . <p> 3 . People who openly mock the Christian faith . When I think of people who openly mock the faith , I think of the secularists , I think of the late-night comedians who make sport of the gospel . I think of the pop culture icons who detest Jesus : Bill Maher , Jon Stewart and Richard Dawkins . The knee-jerk reaction to mockers is to mock back . To come up with an equally witty response . To create a Facebook page with a bold Christian statement and have 10,000 people like it to make us feel better . But maybe , just maybe , we should simply pray for them . I think of Jesus attitude on the cross toward the mockers . He said " Forgive them , for they know not what they do " ( Luke 23:34 ) . What should we pray for them ? For the Holy Spirit to work in their hearts to find salvation in Christ . Think of Saul of Tarsus . He had heard the sermons and mocked them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyr . He actively pursued Christians to put them in jail and even to their deaths . And yet God radically pursued Paul on the road to Damascus and he became the Apostle Paul . Maybe todays mocker is tomorrows evangelist . Have we considered that ? So let 's pray for those who mock the Christian faith . By doing so , we not only avoid the sin of bitterness in our own hearts , but we demonstrate that Gods sovereignty and power is not weakened by the open hostility of those who oppose Him . <p> 4 . Highly critical bloggers and commentors . If you want to get a glimpse of the depravity of our fallen world , scroll down on a news article and read through the comments . Even many Christian blogs and news sites attract vile responses , some even by professing followers of Jesus . The Internet has opened the floodgates for trolls and for angry , self-justified people . But have you considered that perhaps those who communicate ungracefully may be doing it from a place of insecurity , brokeness or a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know what motivates the hostility all the time , but I do know that these are people God wants to rescue from themselves . If God could cause revival among the ruthless Ninevites , God could do a work among those who use the Internet for vile purposes . We should pray that God enraptures their soul with the good news of the gospel . We should pray that we do n't  fall into their trap of bitterness and vulgarity . <p> 5 . A person who has deeply wounded you . Jesus said to pray for those who " mistreat you . " I do n't  think forgiveness means you have to endure injustice or abuse . I do n't  think being a Christian means being a doormat over which evil people can walk all over you . But I do believe that , at the most basic level , we should pray for those who deeply wound us . Reconciliation is not always possible , but forgiveness--the letting go of the bitterness from our hearts--is possible as we immerse ourselves in the forgiveness Christ offers to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and joy , we do n't  have to nurse our deep grudges . I think we begin this process in prayer , on our knees , in honesty before God . We pour out the hurts and wounds we 've endured and ask the Lord to help us forgive and to work in the hearts of those who did the wounding . The person who committed the injustice against you was created by God in his image . His soul matters to God as much as your soul . And so we pray for those who hurt us.

" My eight-year-old daughters dark eyes probed mine as I hurried into the Sunday School classroom where I would be greeting a room full of energetic elementary children . <p> " What would make you think that , sweetheart ? " I asked the child whom we had eagerly welcomed into our family seven years earlier , not as a result of the traditional manner of pregnancy , labor and delivery , but rather , through international adoption . <p> Consistent with her introverted , deliberate personality , she silently pointed to new dTcor in the childrens wing hallway : multiple posters that read : Pray Give Adopt . Love the Least of These . " Oh , wow , " I said , realizing my need to reassure her of the risk she had taken to self-disclose vulnerable feelings , " I did n't  even see those when we walked in today . Any minute , kids will be here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can we talk about it this afternoon with your dad over ice cream ? " <p> The posters had been a locally created , well-intentioned effort by some in our church family to recognize Orphan Sunday , a nationally coordinated event to raise awareness about vulnerable children around the globe . As an employee of a national social services and adoption agency that endorses Orphan Sunday , I understood the heart and purpose behind the posters . But as a parent to two maturing , adopted children , I was growing increasingly aware of the churchs responsibility to minister to more than merely adoptive parents ; adoptees also merit consideration of how the Christian community can effectively support , respect and give voice to the complex , lifelong journey of adoption , including how we speak of adopted persons who are vital members of our churches . <p> For families , adoption usually begins as a parent-centered narrative , with stories focused on the factors that led to the decision to adopt . Often followed by a re-telling of the " paper pregnancy , " laced with its frustrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyline frequently features a finale that includes homecoming and the subsequent post-adoption chronicles , which continue to highlight the family and its ensuing transition and adjustments . <p> Altering our paradigm to recognize adoptees as integral parts of our churches means we listen to and value their voices , even when the message they convey may be difficult to hear . Also crucial to this shift is acknowledging that the adoptees story actually began long before " adoption day , " not even at birth , but during the first nine months of life in the womb of his or her birth mother ( Ps. 139 : 13-16 ) . <p> Tara VanderWoude , who is a social worker , adoption educator , adult adoptee and an adoptive parent , explains , " Adoption is n't a one-time event , but an ongoing process , since a childs perspective and understanding change throughout the years . " At the Christian Alliance for Orphans Summit 2015 , Tara observed , <p> When discussing adoption within the Christian adoption community , there tends to be a norm of speaking about it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to provide comfort , peace , and resolution . Of course , adoption involves a tremendous amount of love and creates countless strong familial relationships . But as adoptees come of age and continue to process the persons , circumstances , and events of their lives , many begin understanding adoption in ways that do not solely include the celebration and positivity so often discussed . It is important to ask yourself , as a parent , as a church ministry or leader , Why am I framing it this way ? What messages are being sent to adoptees in my church and could they feel less understood if their adoption-related feelings include loss , anger , or confusion ? How else can I phrase it so that the impact of my words match my intentions ? <p> Over a heaping scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream , my daughter shared with her Dad and me that she felt comfortable discussing her adoption story with friends . She had observed the posters , however , on the heels of an advocacy event where emphasis was placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrences left her feeling labeled and uniquely distinct from other children within the church . Though true she was once an orphan who now has a family , our daughter went on to vocalize that she wants to attend church and " be a Graves , not a girl who everyone else is looking at and feeling sorry for . I just want to be regular like the other kids . " <p> This specific conversation with our daughter ushered us into a new phase of the adoption journey : one which requires attunement , empathy and sensitivity as we learn together how to navigate complexities which our biological son never encountered . It also prompted us to reexamine church adoption and orphan care ministry efforts as they pertain particularly to more than just adoptive parents , but to adopted persons themselves . <p> How The Church Can Support Adoptees <p> Become educated . Effectively ministering to adopted persons requires a willingness to learn and become literate on subjects not previously taught in seminary . Staff ( and even volunteers ) should become familiar with the realities inherent in adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pastors , youth ministers , childrens directors and church leaders willing to attend conferences , workshops and trainings about adoption and to learn from adoption professionals will be better equipped to support adoptees of varying ages . <p> Use adoption language accurately . Remember there are many participants within an adoption , any of whom could be attending your church and hearing the messages you send with your words ( adoptee , birth family , adoptive family ) . Take time to learn from adoption professionals about positive adoption language that respects each member of the adoption triad . <p> Advocate for adoption and orphan care mindfully . As your local church body engages its believers to care for vulnerable children , do so with a holistic mindset , remembering all members of the adoption triad . Be open to involvement and feedback from adult adoptees within the congregation , in addition to adoptive families . <p> Develop a healthy culture that gives voice and cultivates unity . The ability to speak and be heard is a gift biology prepares parents to give , and children to receive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories , " she says , " these children and youth must be taught they have a powerful gift a voice and that they also have caregivers who want to listen and understand their words and their needs . " Similarly , purposeful , deliberate churches will strive to create a sense of belonging for adopted persons by engaging and listening to their voices . <p> As the church boldly champions the truth of James 1:27 , may we also be equally audacious in creating safe spaces for the children we embrace , cherish , love and raise as our own , guiding them toward physical and spiritual maturity . We must remember that the babies grow up they become our fellow church members , who hear and understand what we say about them , about their histories , their previous circumstances , how we use their stories to advocate for vulnerable children everywhere . grace to those who hear " ( Eph. 4:29 ) . 43169 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our son who was adopted from the tiny south African country of Lesotho .

The California law , which was modeled on an Oregon law , will permit physicians to provide lethal prescriptions to mentally competent adults who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and face the expectation that they will die within six months . <p> Here are five things you should know about physician-assisted suicide <p> 1 . Physician-assisted suicide ( PAS ) occurs when a physician facilitates a patients death by providing the necessary means and/or information to enable the patient to perform the life-ending act ( e.g , . the physician provides sleeping pills and information about the lethal dose , while aware that the patient may commit suicide ) . The distinction between PAS and euthanasia is that in the latter , the lethal does is administered by someone other than the patient . So if a physician directly administered a lethal drug it would be euthanasia , either voluntary or non-voluntary ( i.e. , against the will of the patient ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , Washington , and Vermont have legalized physician-assisted suicide . Currently , 1 in 6 Americans lives in a state where a doctor can prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to a patient . However , that may soon increase since nine other states have pending PAS legislation : Kansas , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , New York , New Jersey , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , <p> 3 . The American Medical Association opposes PAS and says it is " fundamentally incompatible with the physicians role as healer , would be difficult or impossible to control , and would pose serious societal risks . " <p> 4 . In the case of Washington v. Glucksberg ( 1997 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment does not guarantee an individual the right to PAS .

Many men can preach a sermon and more than a few can be a seminary president , but only one can father these five children . <p> Thus , my wife and I approach our family with a profound sense of stewardship and intentionality . As parents , we are practitioners , but also observers , always seeking to learn and improve in order to be most faithful . <p> Over the past decade , I 've witnessed in othersand , unfortunately , in myselfthree parental motivations to avoid . Like weeds that force their way through the best-cultivated garden or thickest concrete , these motivations seem stubborn , always reappearing , resilient and always resurfacing . <p> In fact , if I could wish away three parental motives from my heart , and from others , it would be these : ambition , fear and pride . <p> 1 . Parenting out of ambition <p> Parenting out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mothers do this when they vicariously cheer through their daughters and fathers do so when they vicariously play sports through their sons . At a deeper level , this occurs when parents require of their children a level of commitment and accomplishment they never attained . <p> Parental ambition drove Hans Luther to deter his son , Martin , from entering the ministry . Luthers father desired him to study law that he might enjoy financial gain and social respect . Had he been successful , Hans Luther would have deprived the church of one of one of its greatest gifts and delayed the much needed reformation and revival he brought . <p> There is a difference between aspiration and ambition . It is right to have aspirations for our children and to cultivate in them a healthy sense of ambition . But it is wrong to channel our ambitionswhether for their lives or our ownon them , especially when those ambitions are man-centered and not God-centered . <p> 2 . Parenting out of fear <p> Another parental attitude to avoid is fear . Like ambition , fear appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to avoid contact sports and seek to insulate children from harm . At other times , it shows up in " helicopter parenting , " remaining in proximity to our children , helping them make decisions and avoid lifes dangers . <p> In bourgeois Christianity it is often fear of our kids failing in life . The thinking goes , " If my son does n't  make all As he might not score well on the SAT , not get into the best college , or find the best job . Hell be a failure . Hell live in my basement and play Xbox for life . " <p> My wife and I insist our children wear seatbelts , and we hold them to rigorous academic standards . But we aim not to parent out of fear of what they may or may not become . The point is not to be cavalier , recklessly hoping for Gods kind providence . Rather , we should parent out of stewardship and love , not fear and doubt . <p> 3 . Parenting out of pride <p> Parenting out of pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchecked , it will lead us to value morality over spirituality and cultivate children that are self-righteous , but know not Christs righteousness . Parenting out of pride is more concerned about mans evaluation of your parenting than Gods , and more concerned about mans opinion of your children than Gods . <p> Those serving in ministry are especially susceptible to parenting out of pride . An unhealthy commitment to 1 Timothy 3 , and a well-ordered house , can cause one to incentivize moral structure to the oversight of repentance , regeneration , and true submission to Christs Lordship . <p> Even more disastrously , pride can lead parents to prod children down the aisle before the gospel has ripened in their heart . Jesus beckons children to come to him , but he does n't  beckon parents to shove them . Lead them to Jesus , yes . Shove them down the aisle , no . <p> One the contrary , redemptive parenting <p> Due to our sin natures , even our best efforts will remain indecipherably corrupt . But the more one is conscious of a propensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to do so . Gospel-centered parenting focuses on cultivating the heart toward submission to the Word of God , repentance , godliness , and cherishing the gospel . <p> Conclusion <p> Parenting is the most enjoyable and exhilarating responsibility I know . I feel as though I am getting to create , invest , sculpt , build , and nurture all at once . It satisfies the pastor , entrepreneur , teacher , builder , evangelist , and leader within me . <p> As I do this , I know my supererogative responsibility is to tend the heart , nurturing my children in the fear and admonition of the Lord , and teaching them to know , love , and live the gospel . To make sure their heart is right , I must first nurture my own , and that includes forsaking ambition , fear , and pride . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

If God is good , how could he ever be exclusive , so goes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians to absorb this attitude and apply it to our own contexts of church and ministry . Being left out is usually seen as a great evil , one in which we should avoid at all costs . Isnt the Church the place where we all feel included all the time ? <p> I do n't  think its that black and white . Jesus himself makes this a troublesome issue for us by being decisively exclusive on several occasions : <p> Jesus chose 12 disciples from the larger group . There were many he did n't  choose to invite into that circle . " He called his disciples to him and chose 12 of them , whom he also named as apostles . " ( Matt. 4:18-22 , Luke 6:13-16 ) <p> On many occasions , he invited the same three from the 12 to join him for special occasions . Here we see not just an inner circle , but an inner circle within the circle . ( Matt. 17:1-9 , Mark 14:32-35 , Luke 8:49-51 ) <p> He told others that he did n't  come for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . " ( Matt. 15:22-28 ) <p> He upset seemingly good inner circles , like blood family . He denied the request of his own family , using it as an opportunity to say his real family are those who do the will of God . ( Mark 3:31-35 ) <p> Knowing Jesus is without sin and is the embodiment of love , going as far as the cross for unworthy sinners , forces us to create a new category : exclusion motivated by love . Though we cant know all of Gods purposes in exclusion , one benefit it carries is what it exposes . <p> Exclusion exposes pride <p> Being left out will always be a litmus test for pride . As soon as you realize you did n't  get the invite , you are n't  in the inner circle , or you are on the outside , one of two responses happen . <p> The first is the most common : hurt , disappointment and/or anger . Under those surface feelings are deep roots of entitlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be included , that you have merited inclusion , or that you are owed the opportunity to be included , assuming that its the fair thing to do . But our God is n't fair , mercifully so . We live under grace , and that changes the game . <p> To boil it down , being included is about being honored . Like the kids picked first for the kickball team , being chosen for any group is position of honor . No one wants to be last on the team , or worst of all , not picked at all . We want the places of honor . <p> Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples in Matthew 23:1 , 6-8 , 11-12 , saying , <p> Do not do according to the scribes and Pharisees . They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues , and respectful greetings in the market places , and being called Rabbi by men . But the greatest among you shall be your servant . Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made much of , just like the Pharisees . And being left out takes a stab at that . It reminds us that someone else has been chosen . <p> The moment you are excluded is a great opportunity for growth . When our longing to be recognized and honored is exposed we have the opportunity to repent and walk in humility . " A broken and a contrite heart , O God , You will not despise " ( Ps. 51:17 ) . We are given the chance to take up the attitude of a servant , as was Jesuss prescription for his disciples in place of honor-chasing . <p> An opportunity for faith <p> But there is a second response to exclusion that is rarely seen . And like most rare things , it is beautiful . <p> In Matthew 15:22-28 , a woman comes to Jesus with a demon-possessed daughter and begs for her healing . Three times Jesus says , " No , I did not come to help you . " <p> But he did not answer her a word . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep of the house of Israel . " <p> And he answered , " It is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs . " <p> Jesus calls her a dog and says he will not help her because he was not sent for her but for the Jews . Jesus excludes her from his benefits because she is n't from the right group . <p> And to this she said : " Yes , Lord , yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table .

@@100509386 @4709386/ <h> Supporting adoption to war against abortion <p> By this time you 've heard of or seen the undercover videos taken of Planned Parenthood about their harvesting and selling of baby body parts . ( If you have n't seen them , click here . ) They are incredibly difficult to watch but are helping raise awareness about the horrors of abortion . You may think , " Yes , this is awful , but what can I do ? " While there are many things you can do to help , I want to highlight just one for your consideration . <p> Adopt . <p> My husband and I felt the call to take this step a few years ago . One of the primary reasons adoption is so near to my heart is because abortion breaks my heart . After all , abortion stops a beating heart . An unborn babys heart starts beating around 18 days after conception , typically before a mama even knows there is life inside her womb . And , yet , it is completely legal to stop these hearts . I wont go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line is that abortion does n't  have to happen at all . <p> There are many ministries and other non-profit organizations whose sole purpose is to help women in crisis pregnancies . They provide many free services , including pregnancy tests , ultrasounds , diapers , clothes and more . They also educate women on the options of parenting and adoption . <p> Its true that the wait for newborns can be quite lengthy ; however , I am convinced that if we spread awareness that there are couples willing and able to take these children into their homes , more women would choose life for their unborn babies . As the need for homes grows , there wont be enough of them for these babies if we do n't  step up . Not only that , but there are many children of all ages who are in need of good homes at least for a season . Working through your states foster care system can be difficult , but it is free of charge . <p> As Christians , we know that the Bible tells us clearly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are all called to support adoption , here are three ways you can help : <p> 1 . Pray . Pray for women in unplanned pregnancies to choose life for their unborn babies . Pray for couples willing to adopt . Pray for the process to be as smooth as possible and for the funds to come together . Pray for the adoption agencies as they reach out to women in unplanned pregnancies and work with couples who are wanting to adopt . Pray about what you can do to help . <p> 2 . Donate . Finances can be stretched thin , and it seems there is always someone asking for something , but this is where you put your money where your mouth is . Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also ( Matt. 6:21 ) . If you truly care about life , you will support this movement financially . You can donate to the pro-life agencies , adoption agencies and the couples who are planning to adopt . Every little bit helps . <p> 3 . Adopt . Not everyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  adopt out of fear or insecurity . Do n't  worry about the money . Do n't  worry about how the child will fit into your family . Do n't  worry about what others will think . Do n't  get me wrong , you need to pray and plan and make sure your child will be in a secure and safe environment , but you do n't  have to worry . If God has called you to adopt , He will work it all out . Even if its difficult , it will be worth it . <p> The Bible leaves no room for doubt that adoption is dear to Gods heart . After all , he adopted us in Christ ( Ephesians 1 ) . Adoption is a beautiful alternative to abortion and a marvelous picture of the gospel .

@@100509387 @4709387/ <h> Is " me time " biblical ? <p> The world tells women that they need and deserve to find time for themselves . Yet , as a Christian mother , I find myself a bit hesitant to pursue it . <p> Do n't  get me wrong . I 'd love some me time . As a mother of little ones , I rarely have a moment of uninterrupted thought . My hesitation comes as I consider the idea of spending time solely on myself , rather than on serving the needs of my family . It just seems contrary to what I think I ought to be doing as a Christian mom . <p> As I look at the heart of the worlds advice , it seems women are being told they must find the time to escape from their normal reality and re-energize by focusing on themselves for a while . This might include being pampered by a massage or facial , or it could be a night out with friends . The main idea , though , is for women to relax and treat themselves to activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . <p> That does n't  sound all badand those activities are n't  bad in and of themselves . Yet , the secular worldview does n't  take into account several realities that I believe could transform the typical me time mentality into a more God-honoring time of true refreshment . By acknowledging the following truths , I believe me time can be redeemed for Christian women . <p> 1 . We can never really escape reality , especially the reality that we live in Gods kingdom . <p> The secular idea of escaping reality for an evening of personal relaxation forgets to take into account that we live in a universe where God exists and that he is King ( Ps. 103:19 ) . We live , move and have our being under his rulership , whether or not our families are in our proximity ( Acts 17:28 ) . <p> Our alone time can never be viewed as a way to do whatever we want with no regard for the King . It is always secondary to his authority over us . As believers we are happy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered a gift from him , especially as we acknowledge that he is primary . <p> 2 . Since we live in a kingdom that is not our own , " me time " is really his time . <p> Since God is creator and owner of everything that exists , even our time must be considered his . The world would have us believe otherwise . The name itself depicts this . It is mine . I have rights to it . I deserve to spend it however I choose . These are thoughts that even my own sinful heart seeks to demand . But Christ has bought us with his blood ( 1 Cor. 6:19-20 ) . As Christians , we are fully his . Just as our lives are not our own , neither is our time . How we spend time alone must ultimately be how he wants us to spend it . <p> 3 . We must take into account the paradoxical nature of Gods kingdom . <p> Me time insists that if I live for myself , I will benefit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the disciples disputed over who is the greatest , Jesus declared the greatest will be the least ( Luke 22:26 ) . At other times , he said the first in this world will be last ( Matt. 19:30 ) . The humble will be exalted ( Matt. 23:12 ) . Giving is better than receiving ( Acts 20:35 ) . And dying brings life ( Luke 9:24 ) . <p> The world calls these things foolishness because they do not have eyes of faith . But sadly , I think many Christian moms have also neglected to believe this principle . We get caught up in serving our families more out of obligation than by faith and begin to view mundane tasks as insignificant . If we really believed that God brings eternal rewards for us as we serve by faith , maybe we would n't need alone time as much as we think we do ( Matt. 10:42 , Col. 3:23-24 ) . Loving our families would become more of a joy instead of a burden . Our hope and sense of fulfillment would be set more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time alone for ourselves . <p> So , is me time biblical ? Given the worlds definition , I would n't exactly say yes . However , time alone can certainly be a kind gift from God , especially as we acknowledge the realities explained above . If he gives you some time to yourself , thank him for it , put your hope in him and use it for his glory . <p> How ? Meditate on the Scriptures . Journal or reflect on how he might be growing you through specific life circumstances . Talk with him about these things . Prayerfully dream of ways he might want to use you in ministry , either more intentionally to your family or to others . Actually minister to others . Have life-giving conversation with a Christian friend . Go for a walk , enjoying the world he gave us . Or , use the creativity he put within you to make something unique . These are all ways to use alone time that honor him and acknowledge his kingship . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509389 @4709389/ <h> Why Kim Davis was right not to resign <p> Should Kim Davis , the Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage license , have resigned ? <p> Over the past week many people , including many Christians sympathetic to her cause , have said Davis should resigned from her elected position as Rowan County Clerk if her conscience wo n't allow her to do the job as required . While I understand the reasoning , and am even partially sympathetic to that view , I think it misses the reason Davis acted as she did and how her choice does not necessarily conflict with the rule of law . <p> For at least fifty years it has not been a requirement that you must do every aspect of your job , despite your beliefs , or automatically resign . As Ryan Anderson wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed : <p> We have a rich history of accommodating conscientious objectors in a variety of settings , including government employees . Do we really want to say that an otherwise competent employee must quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't  believe we do want to say that . In fact , I believe one of the quickest ways to government tyranny is to require every religious believer with conscientious objections to immoral laws and government overreach to resign from government positions . <p> While we do n't have an absolute right to religious liberty , we also do n't give up every religious liberty when we work for the government . ( For more on this , see legal scholar Eugene Volokh 's explanation for when your religion can legally excuse you from doing part of your job . ) To determine where the line gets drawn , we need some form of negotiation between the believer and the state . <p> Ideally , the individual states would have been given time to issue a relevant policy . For example , Kentucky could have either accommodated the religious beliefs of same-sex marriage objectors or made it clear that they would need to resign their position if they could not , in good conscience , issue marriage licenses with their name on them . However , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they required the changes to be made immediately and did not give states the time needed to address the issue . As Ryan Anderson adds , <p> Had same-sex marriage come to Kentucky through the Legislature , lawmakers could have simultaneously created religious liberty protections and reasonable accommodations for civil servants . But the Supreme Court decided this issue itself and , as predicted by the dissenting justices , primed the nation for conflict . <p> Because each marriage license issued by the clerks office bore her name and title , Ms. Davis concluded that her religious beliefs meant she could not have her office issue licenses to same-sex couples . So she had the office stop issuing them entirely . <p> Still , the individual states should have made it a priority to address the concerns after the Obergefell ruling in June . Kentucky did not do so . Instead , when the governor was asked to call a special session of the legislature to try to work out a reasonable accommodation , he said it could wait until January . <p> What were those with religious objections supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violate her conscience until the other elected officials in Kentucky decided to act ? By refusing to quit or violate her conscience , Davis attempted to force the state to address the issue . She even filed a federal complaint against state officials under the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which should have been sufficient to resolve the issue . As Eugene Volokh says , <p> So if Kim Davis does indeed go through the state courts , and ask for a modest exemption under the state RFRA simply to allow her to issue marriage licenses ( opposite-sex or same-sex ) without her name on them she might indeed prevail . Rightly or wrongly , under the logic of Title VIIs religious accommodation regime and the RFRA religious accommodation regime , she probably should prevail . <p> The state of Kentucky should have quickly responded by making it clear they were open to considering removing the clerks names if they had an objection ( a simple enough change ) or they should have told Davis and all other clerks in the state that there would be no accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage licenses ( a move that would have been politically unpopular ) . The state did neither , and instead the federal government intervenedonce againin a state issue and made the situation messier than it needed to be . <p> On the bright side , this may be the wake-up call other states need to realize they need to clarify their policies . It may also help Americans better understand how many exemptions and accommodations are already allowed , and that we do n't  necessarily have to give up our religious freedom simply because we work for the government or get elected to office . By refusing to take the easy way out and resign , Davis has forced a much needed conversation about religious liberty in America . 43169 @qwx903169 43177 @qwx903177 43180 @qwx903180 43186 @qwx903186

@@100509391 @4709391/ <h> Married couples and boundaries with the opposite sex <p> Marriage does not necessarily isolate one from the opposite sex . If , as Christians , we are in community , we will surely interact with men and women from church to work . Its good and healthy . God created us for community , and if we are indeed a family as the church , relating to one another is not only necessary but also beneficial to the Body as a whole . <p> Yet , the question of boundaries has us asking and evaluating , once again , the when , where and how of male and female relationships . <p> Marriage is a covenant , and boundaries are important , but what should that look like ? We do n't  want to fear adultery , yet we do n't  want to walk in an unwise manner ; as it has been said , most people do not plan to commit adultery . But we also want to be careful not to add a one-size-fits-all set of rules and regulations for every relationship . <p> Courtney Ressig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the importance of boundaries in male and female relationships . She and her husband of six years , Daniel , decided early on in their marriage to make engaging with the opposite sex an important topic and area for concern . I asked her how she and her husband operate and why she believes boundaries are important . <p> What is your general philosophy for male and female relationships ? <p> Our general philosophy is to live transparently with one another . For us , that is key . For example , Daniel travels a fair amount for his job . In his industry , a lot of business happens over meals/drinks when they are at trade shows . Unless he is traveling with another co-worker or his boss , he does n't do the late dinners with other salespeople after the shows end . <p> When he is away , he is open about the conversations he has with everyone he comes in contact with , especially the opposite sex . Basically , we try to have an open line of communication going at all times for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off those interactions ; we simply try to keep the each other in the loop . If we always know what 's going on with each other , it keeps us from retreating into a private relationship . <p> Youve written a book about feminism . Do you think the feminist movement has affected how men and women relate ? <p> Yes . In my book I say that all of the results of feminism are n't bad . I think the fact that men and women can ( and do ) interact more than they used to is a good thing . Men and women should n't be afraid of one another although sin has made us at odds in a number of ways . But what I think feminism has done poorly is made any sort of caution sound like chauvinism or unfair treatment . <p> In the church , I think we have adopted a mindset that if a man or woman has boundaries , they are assuming that either women are sex kittens waiting to pounce or men are unable to control their lustful impulses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do think feminism has influenced us into thinking that the differences between men and women really are n't as real as they actually are , which leads us to think that we can all interact without ever seeing any ramifications of that . A quick survey of our evangelical history shows us that ca n't be the case . <p> You and Daniel set up boundaries from the beginning of your marriage . Why did you believe this was important ? <p> Our boundaries started with each other before we were married . We were committed to purity , and Daniel led us in a number of ways to establish boundaries to protect each other from sinning against the other sexually . This carried over into our marriage as we wanted to set up a hedge of protection against outside influences coming into the marriage that could tempt us to sin against the other sexually . I carried a lot of baggage into the marriage from my past relationships with the opposite sex , so I personally needed to lean toward harder boundaries because I knew my own inclinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew that if we did n't set up boundaries before things got hard , then it would be all the more easy to let our guard down in moments of frustration with each other . <p> What are some of the boundaries you have set in place in regards to interacting with the opposite sex ? <p> One big one we have is related to Facebook . We do n't accept or solicit friend requests from past boyfriends or girlfriends . That just does n't feel wise to us . When we were first married , we copied each other on every email to the opposite sex . We do n't do that anymore , namely because not every email warrants that . But when it comes to church emails to members of the opposite sex or emails of a personal nature , we copy each other . Again , transparency is key for us . We also do n't eat alone with members of the opposite sex if at all possible . This has n't come up much for us , but there have been times where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told me , and it was not a regular occurrence . For us , it 's helpful to remember that situations and people are complex , and there is room for freedom and flexibility for situations that are outside of our control . <p> You both travel he mostly . What are some parameters you have in place for travel ? <p> I 've already touched on some of these , but another boundary he has in place is that when he 's staying in a hotel , he always tells me what he is watching on television before he watches it . He also sticks to a few channels and only goes to those channels . Basically , he 's not channel surfing the whole night . He knows what he will watch ( usually a sporting event ) , and he sticks with it . He also plans on working in the evenings while he travels , so if something does come up ( an invite to dinner ) , he already has plans in place to decline the invitation . <p> Boundaries are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage . What are ways that you and Daniel try to prioritize your marriage ? <p> This one feels like it 's always changing . We just had a baby ( and we have twin two-year-old boys ) , so finding time is hard ! But again , we try to keep running communication . We do n't do this perfectly by any means , but we try to be open and honest about how we are feeling about things . Especially for me , I can get lost in my own head and spiral into scenarios that are n't even on the radar , so talking about what is going on in my head is really helpful for our marriage . <p> When he 's in a busy travel season , I try to keep my evenings free when he 's about to leave and when he comes home . I can get stuck in my routine of being a single parent with all my evenings to myself , so if I 'm not careful to keep that time free for him , I can easily forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! We try to reserve Friday evening specifically for time together and other evenings if our season allows for it . We also do a date swap with some friends who also have young children . <p> What do you say to the person who thinks that it 's all " overboard " or not necessary ? In other words , they 'd say the safeguards are n't necessary . <p> I would say that Paul was serious when he said " let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall " ( 1 Cor. 10:12 ) . I do n't think everyone is a walking adulterer waiting to start on affair , but I do think that sin is serious , and we often underestimate the depravity of our own hearts . I would rather err on the side of caution then assume that anything is not possible for me . I do n't think this means I run from any interaction with men . That does n't seem wise to me . But I do think it means I am aware that based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect myself and my marriage from my tendency toward wandering away from God and his commands . <p> What I think is often missing from the debate about whether or not we should have guidelines is an understanding of the weaker brother/sister . We do n't know the struggles and past sin experiences of everyone , so if someone has boundaries that are more or less stringent than our own , we would serve them well by respecting their boundaries instead of vilifying them for them . <p> *** <p> Perhaps the question is n't so much how should men and women interact , but rather are we willing to lovingly serve others boundaries and respect their marriage ? Set rules for everyone is likely less than helpful , but remembering to respect the conviction of our fellow brothers and sisters is essential to brotherly and sisterly love . 43169 @qwx903169 43181 @qwx903181 43187 @qwx903187 43178 @qwx903178

USCIRF ( pronounced you-surf by policy wonks ) is an independent , bipartisan government commission created as part of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 ( IRFA ) . The intended purpose of IRFA is <p> " To express United States foreign policy with respect to , and to strengthen United States advocacy on behalf of , individuals persecuted in foreign countries on account of religion ; to authorize United States actions in response to violations of religious freedom in foreign countries ; " ( PDF ) <p> When President Bill Clinton signed IRFA into law , unity on this issue was exceedingly bipartisan , with a 98-0 vote in the Senate and a 375-41 vote in the House . <p> 2 .

" <p> Further , as part of this report USCIRF may make policy recommendations to Congress and the President in response to documented religious persecution . USCIRF commissioners and staff also to testify before Congress , provide briefings , and publish fact sheets about specific countries . <p> 3 . USCIRF is made up of nine volunteer commissioners , assisted by a nonpartisan staff . By law , the commissioners are appointed to two-year terms ( renewable ) according to this formula : three appointments by the President , two by congressional leaders of the Presidents party , and four by the congressional leaders of the party not in the White House .

Recent travel has included the nations of Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Burma , Egypt , Nigeria , Ethiopia , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Russia . Other travel included visits with Syrian refugees , and with people seeking asylum through U.S.-based detention centers . <p> 5 . USCIRF has launched a number of collaborative initiatives to build global consensus on the freedom of religion and belief . The Defending Freedoms Project provides the opportunity for members of Congress to adopt prisoners of conscience in order to raise awareness . This public " adoption " often leads to better treatment of the adopted prisoner even if they are n't  fully released .

The extreme examples of the Islamic State in Iraq and Boko Haram in Africa are the tip of the iceberg of a global environment in which the Pew Research Center reports 76 percent of our fellow human beings " live in countries with a high or very high level of restrictions on religion .

Authors and husband and wife , Justin and Lindsey Holcomb , have responded to parents concerns by writing God Made All of Me : A Book to Help Children Protect Their Bodies , a resource for moms , dads and caregivers who want to protect and educate their children . <p> Justin and Lindsey share about the book in this Q&amp;A . <p> Q : What prompted you to write God Made All of Me ? What age range was it written for ? <p> The book is for two to eight year old boys and girls . We wrote it because we have two young children and know that parents need tools to help them address body parts with their kids and to help them understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate touch . It allows families to build a first line of defense against sexual abuse in the safety of their own homes . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children from sexual abuse . Because private parts are private , there can be lots of questions , curiosity or shame regarding them . For their protection , children need to know about private parts and understand that God made their body and made it special . <p> We want parents and caregivers to be smarter and better prepared than those who would want to harm children . While we know that actions by adults can be more effective than expecting children to protect themselves from sexual abuse , children still need accurate , age-appropriate information about child sexual abuse and the confidence that their parents and caregivers will support them . That is why we used the storybook approach . <p> Q : You were intentional about using the terms " appropriate " and " inappropriate " when referring to kinds of touch , instead of the words " good " or " bad . " Why ? <p> It is important to be clear with adults and children about the difference between touch that is appropriate and touch that is inappropriate . Experts discourage any use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two main reasons . First , some sexual touch feels good and then children get confused wondering if it was good or bad . Second , children who have been taught " good touch " or " bad touch " would be less likely to tell a trusted adult as they perceive they have done something bad . <p> Say something like this to your child : " Most of the time you like to be hugged , snuggled , tickled and kissed , but sometimes you do n't  , and that 's okay . Let me know if anyone family member , friend or anyone else touches you or talks to you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable . " <p> Q : Why do you encourage moms and dads to use the proper names when referring to private body parts , even for young children ? <p> It can be uncomfortable at first , but using the proper names of body parts is important . This knowledge gives children correct language for understanding their bodies , for asking questions that need to be asked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . <p> Offenders most likely will not talk to children about their private parts by using the anatomically correct names for genitalia . They will likely use some playful sounding term to make it sound more like a game . <p> Q : How did you approach talking about this issue with your own children ? <p> We started by teaching them the proper names of their private parts at an early age and telling them that their bodies are strong , beautiful and made by God . We read books to them from an early age on this topic and would talk about who can help them in the bathroom or bath and that it was okay for the doctor to check their private parts at appointments when mom or dad is present . <p> We would also role play different scenarios to get them thinking about what they would do if someone approached them and wanted to touch their private parts , show theirs , take pictures , etc . Play the " what if " game with them at the dinner table with different scenarios to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills . " If someone asked you to show them your private parts and promised to give you candy if you did n't  tell anyone , what would you do ? " Remind them that they can tell you anything and anytime without fear of getting into trouble . <p> We 've also tried to instill a sense of the control our kids have over their own bodies . We would tell them to say " no " or " stop " when they were all done being hugged , tickled or wrestled . We encourage them to practice this with us so they feel confident saying it to others if the need arises . We also tell them they do n't  have to hug or kiss a family member if they do n't  want to and teach them how to express this without being rude . It is important to empower children to be in charge of their bodies instead of at the mercy of adults . <p> Q : Is there a way to educate your children about this without instilling fear ? <p> It is important to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . Clearly identify for your child which parts of their anatomy are private . Explain to your child that " some places on your body should never be touched by other people except when you need help in the bathroom , are getting dressed , or when you go to the doctor . " You can do this with young children during bath time or have your child dress in a bathing suit and show them that all areas covered by a bathing suit are " private . " The bathing suit analogy can be a bit misleading because it fails to mention that other parts of the body can be touched inappropriately ( like mouth , legs , neck , arms ) , but it is a good start for little ones to understand the concept of private parts . <p> To teach about sexual abuse offenders , it is important to teach your kids about " tricky people . " Tricky people are grown-ups who ask kids for help or tell kids to keep a secret from their parents . Teach your kids not to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ask for permission first . <p> Q : What do parents need to know about child sexual abuse offenders ? <p> Although strangers are stereotyped as perpetrators of sexual assault , the evidence indicates that a high percentage of offenders are acquaintances of the victim . <p> Most child sexual abuse offenders describe themselves as religious and some studies suggest the most egregious offenders tend to be actively involved with their faith community . Sex offenders are often religious and many of them attend church . In a study of 3,952 male sex offenders , 93 percent of these perpetrators described themselves as " religious . " <p> Dr. Anna Salter , a sexual offender treatment provider , states it is important for parents and child-serving organizations , such as churches , to avoid " high risk situations .

What are some ways parents can help their extended family understand the physical boundaries they allow their kids to have ? <p> It is important to teach kids how to say , " Stop , " " All done , " and " No more . " You can reiterate this by stopping immediately when your child expresses that they are all done with the hugging or tickling . Your reaction is noteworthy for them as it demonstrates they have control over their bodies and desires . <p> If there are extended family members who may have a hard time understanding your family boundaries , you can explain that you are helping your children understand their ability to say no to unwanted touch , which will help them if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child does not want to kiss Grandpa , let them give a high five or handshake instead . <p> Q : What are some practical things parents can do to protect their children from sexual abuse ? <p> In our book , the last page is to parents and is called , " 9 Ways to Protect Your Children from Sexual Abuse .

You can read about all nine here . <p> Q : What advice do you have for parents who want to create an open environment in their home so that their children always feel comfortable talking to them about issues related to their sexuality or body ? <p> We remind parents that some people are out there looking to prey on our children .

@@100509396 @4709396/ <h> 4 Things Christians Say When They Deny Religious Liberty to Others <p> A controversy is brewing over the proposed construction of a muslim cemetery , mosque and training center in my town of Farmersville , Texas . Many local residents have expressed opposition to the project and have called upon our city government to block the construction of the facility . The relevant meetings took place while I was out of town , so I do not have first-hand knowledge of the situation . <p> However , I understand from others that some of those who have voiced their opposition have been Christians . And perhaps there are many more Christians who are n't sure what position to take . As a pastor , I have something to say to the members of my church and the Christians in the area regarding how Jesus expects us to respond to the religious nature of this controversy . When Christians say that the city of Farmersville should block the construction of an Islamic facility in our town , we 're saying a lot more than we think we are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little confidence in the gospel of Jesus Christ . <p> Paul wrote in Romans 1 that he is not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation for all who believe . I preached from this text just a few weeks ago . I believe that this sentence in the book of Romans is an important and timely message for us . I do n't believe that I have to supplement the power of the gospel with the authority of the Farmersville City Council because I am confident in the power of God in the gospel . The god who needs Mayor Helmberger to come to his rescue is not a very big god ( and I mean no offense to the mayor by saying so ) . <p> Those who want the power of the government to block the construction of Islamic facilities in Farmersville are doing things the muslim way , not the Christian way . They 're doing things the Iranian way , not the American way . Muslims co-opt the apparatus of the state and use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against competing faiths with which they disagree and which they perceive as dangerous to their muslim way of life . <p> Personally , I think the reason why there is no religious liberty in North Africa and the Middle East is because Islam is a weak faith . The personal allegiance of the followers of Islam in those nations is not strong enough to keep them in the fold ; therefore , the government must threaten them with death if they convert and must force out all other influences . They have no confidence in their faith . It is too weak to stand a fair hearing in an open marketplace of ideas . <p> I think better things of the gospel of Jesus Christ , and so should you if you are a Christian . City ordinances are not the power of God unto salvation . Planning and zoning recommendations are not the power of God unto salvation . The gospel is the power of God unto salvation . It has survived for two thousand years without the coercive arm of government to sustain it . C. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Word of God can take care of itself , and will do so if we preach it and cease defending it . See you that lion . They have caged him for his preservation ; shut him up behind iron bars to secure him from his foes ! See how a band of armed men have gathered together to protect the lion . What a clatter they make with their swords and spears ! These mighty men are intent upon defending a lion . O fools , and slow of heart ! Open that door ! Let the lord of the forest come forth free . Who will dare to encounter him ? What does he want with your guardian care ? Let the pure gospel go forth in all its lion-like majesty , and it will soon clear its own way and ease itself of its adversaries . <p> Jesus lived in an Israel occupied by the Romans . The Roman Empire was not disposed well toward Christianity . It deliberately promoted Roman mythology in Israel . Some Jews were trying to organize to force the Roman presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explicitly rejected that approach . " My kingdom is not of this world , " Jesus said . He placed His confidence in the spiritual work of the gospel , which is more powerful than any political movement , to throw off the yoke of Roman occupation . <p> I believe that Jesus ' actions and statements regarding the Roman presence in Israel give us the pattern for our response to situations such as the one that we face today . If I am wrong , then I ask you this question : Which story or teaching from the New Testament supports your approach ? For my part , I only find that kind of action in the gospels and the book of Acts being carried out by the heathen . The mob in Nazareth tried to kill Jesus . The mob in Ephesus fomented a riot to try to defeat Paul . The mob in the Jerusalem temple tried to kill Paul . So , who is our modelJesus and the Apostles or the heathen in the New Testament ? <p> 2 . We are saying that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they are n't too visibly active in our neighborhood . <p> Show me a way to eliminate all mosques everywhere by convincing everyone in the world that Islam is a false religion , and you 'll have my support . What does it mean if I object to the construction of a mosque in Farmersville but make no protest against the construction of a mosque in Plano ? What does it mean if I harshly object to having an Islamic training center in town but it does n't  bother me that my next door neighbor is an atheist ? <p> If we have constructed a comfortable bubble in our cities that isolates us from the world around us and prevents us from being grieved over the fact that people all over the world live next to Islamic training centers , then I say let God do whatever is necessary to tear that bubble down . The victory does n't  matter if we achieve the relocation of a muslim center with the same number of adherents who are just as committed as they were before . The only result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Out of sight , out of mind " is not actually a proverb from the Bible . It is certainly no way for Christians to feel about the presence of false religions in the world . But if we decide that lost people everywhere are our business , then we can be thankful when God brings those lost people to our doorsteps . We just broadened the opportunity for how many of our local Christians can participate in cross-cultural evangelism ! Winning the lost to Christ is our mission , right ? How does it advance that mission for us to make sure that they are farther away from us ? It seems to me that it only makes sense to keep them away if we actually have no intention whatsoever of sharing the gospel with them . <p> 3 . We are telling the government that we think they ought to choose between religions they like and do n't like and then use city government to make life impossible for the religions they do n't like . <p> This is a particularly foolish time for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're less than a month past a Supreme Court decision in which four justices warned us about serious threats to religious liberty that are coming our way . How can we argue at the national level that we believe in religious liberty for all people while at the local level we 're running Muslims out of town ? Christians are going to City Hall seeking to become religious oppressors . I tell you , my friends , whatever the city government does against an Islamic training center today , they 'll be doing it against Bible-believing , Bible-preaching churches in twenty years . <p> The First Amendment is a good thing . I 'm in favor of religious liberty for all Americans . This means that anywhere I can build a church , Muslims can build a mosque . Anywhere I can put a Baptist campground , Muslims can build an Islamic training center . If I did n't affirm that , I 'd be saying , " I want religious liberty for me but not for anyone else . " Fair-minded judges are not going to be disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual and national forefathers did , we need to take a stand for everyones religious liberty . Doing so will tell a watching world that we 're not just looking out for our own interests , but that we really do believe in the First Amendment 's guarantee of religious liberty for all Americans . <p> 4 . We are telling the world that we do not trust God to take care of us . <p> Some of what drives the opposition is a fear that Muslims will stream out of the training center with dynamite strapped to their chests so they can blow us up . There are elements of that point of view that do n't make much sense to me . Last year , drunk drivers killed more Americans than have died in all the phases of the global war on terror combined . But when Farmersville legalized alcohol sales a few years ago , there was no organized protest that I recall . This opposition lacks lacks logical sense . But , then , fears often do . <p> Why are we so fearful ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherd-boy who stared down Goliath of Gath , so fearful ? Why are the followers of the God of Elijah , the prophet who called down fire from heaven and shamed the prophets of Baal , so fearful ? Why are the followers of the God of Peter , the apostle whom an angel released from prison the night before his execution , so fearful ? What does fear say about our faith ? Is that the message we want our community to receive ? <p> Rather than react in fear and hostility , the Christians of Farmersville need to be asking ourselves , " What are the best things I can be doing today to pave the way for me to share the gospel with Muslims in Farmersville ? " Make no mistake about it : That is our mission . When Jesus gave it to us , it came with a promise : " Lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the age . " We have a promise from Jesus , and we do not need to be afraid . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that the message does n't get lost in the midst of all the bad things we are saying through our actions . 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170

We do not choose our times , or the opportunities that we are given . But Senator McConnell , you now have a chance to remind not only Republicans , but the country , of what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own species deserves protection , care , and welcome . Every baby deserves a home , and every mother deserves a helping hand . This principle goes beyond and outside politics , but S. 1881 is one form of its political expression . It is just the kind of principle that , when articulated with clarity , confidence , and grace , can inspire admiration and respect . Such principled stands , regardless of any political calculus about their risks and rewards , are the basis for renewing our civic life and a young generations belief that the gears of government do not simply grind at the behest of the highest bidder or most powerful lobby . <p> The argument on behalf of S. 1881 is simple : we now know that Planned Parenthood is an organization that houses practices that , even if legal , are grossly immoral and repugnant to people of common sense . But they are almost certainly not even legal . If Planned Parenthood is not profiting from these sales , then why do its executives clearly entertain various pricing options in the videos from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various videos show only isolated , rogue individuals rather than structural features of the organizationthat these are abuses , rather than commonplace .

If we are , as a society , to allow such tissue to become products for research , we can not bear to recognize them as what we ourselves are : human beings . This is a structural feature to Planned Parenthoods abortion business , and itself sufficient reason to ensure our tax dollars are never given to them . Such dehumanization of members of our own species is , tragically , not unknown in American history . South Carolina recently removed the flag of the last society to institutionalize it , an institution that the Republican party you lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against . <p> Yes , it is possible that defunding Planned Parenthood will lead to a potential disruption in some health services for low-income women . However , our intolerance for any social harms does not entail that we should continue to commit evils in order to avoid them , as we have learned recently in our debates on torture . The wrong , in this case , is grave and serious enough to justify any potential disruptionand , as you know , S. 1881 seeks to avoid one by redirecting funds toward other organizations . Planned Parenthood is not too big to be defunded ; no institution should be , as otherwise they would hold far too much power over the operations of the government and our society . <p> The question before us , Senator McConnell , is not what kind of civilization we will be .

Jesus would say " You are made in my Image , and I love you . " <p> Just like Leelah , all people are wonderfully made in Gods image ( Gen. 1:26-28 ) . We are each knit together in our mothers womb ( Ps. 139:13-14 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image bearer of God . When people see you , they see a reflection of the glory of the God who made you . <p> Jesus would say to you that you have value and worth because God made you . He would say something like , " no matter what anyone tells you , you are valuable and I love you . Come and find refuge in my faithful arms , I made you and I will protect you " ( Ps. 91:4 ) . <p> 2 . Jesus would say " You are broken , just like everyone else . " <p> Leelah was an image bearer of God , but he was a broken one . Just like you are . Just like I am . Every person who has ever been born , except Jesus , is deeply and totally affected by the curse of sin ( Ps. 51:4 ; Rom. 5:12 ) . We are all relationally , sexually , morally , rationallybroken .

" <p> There 's a scene in the Bible where Jesus declared that a man was born blind so " that the works of God might be displayed in him " ( John 9:3 ) . God works in the mist of our fallen , sinful , broken lives for his glory . In fact , he only uses broken , sinful , needy people who have sinful struggles . <p> That does not give us an excuse to give into temptation , but it does give us hope that God can use even the most heinous sinful struggles to display his grace and sufficiency in our lives . If God did this with a self-righteous murderer like the Apostle Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( John 21 ) , he can do it with you and me . <p> Jesus would say something like this to you , " I know you do not understand how I can use your struggle and your pain , but I can . I can work all things together for the good of those who love me and are called according to my purposeI can even use your struggle with transgender feelings in ways you can not imagine " ( Rom. 8:28 ) . <p> 4 . Jesus would say " I came to rescue people like you , so trust in me . " <p> Jesus did n't  come to rescue people who had it all together . In fact , He said " I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance " ( Luke 5:32 ) . It may seem insensitive to talk about sin at a time when you already feel so unloved and misunderstood , but all of our confusion about who we are in life flows from this very issue . <p> All of us , whether we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sinners . That means that we have disobeyed Gods design in every imaginable way . In the way we think , the way we talk , the way we treat othersthe ways are too many for us to count .

There 's a place in the Bible where we are told " God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us " ( Rom. 5:8 ) . Jesus came to rescue us from our sin by dying in the place of sinners and then rising from the dead to forgive us of our sins . <p> For those who truly believe in Jesus , God will never turn away ( John 6:37 ) and rather than count all their sins against them , he will forgive them and throw them " as far as the east is from the west " ( Ps. 32:1-2 , 103:11-12 ; 2 Cor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message of hate is not listening to what has really been said .

@@100509399 @4709399/ <h> Explainer : What you should know about fetal tissue donation <p> Several recent videos have revealed Planned Parenthood executives discussing the disposition of fetal body parts , such as livers , hearts , and limbs , which were collected after abortions . The videos have caused many people to question the morality of a process they had previously been completely unaware even existed . Here is what you should know about the ethics and legality of fetal tissue donation : <p> What is fetal tissue donation ? <p> A human fetus ( Latin for " offspring " ) is the stage of human development from the embryo stage ( the end of the eighth week after conception , when the major structures have formed ) until birth . When the fetus dies , either naturally or by abortion , the tissue ( including intact organs ) can be legally donated for research purposes . <p> Where do fetal tissue donations go ? <p> Medical researchers obtain fetal tissue from a variety of sources including , hospitals , nonprofit tissue banks ( one of which is funded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often a third-party vendor serves as the go-between , acquiring , screening , and transporting the tissue from the source of origination to the research lab . <p> Is fetal tissue donation ethical ? <p> The morality of fetal tissue donation primarily hinges on questions about how the child died and the informed consent of the donating parents . <p> Most Christian ethicists agree that fetal tissue donation is not inherently unethical if the tissue was obtained from a spontaneous abortion ( miscarriage ) or an ectopic pregnancy ( a pregnancy in which the fetus implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus ) and was willingly donated by the parent . Such donations would be similar to a parent agreeing to donate the organs of an infant or a child that had died by natural causes . <p> The donations are morally tainted , however , when the tissue is derived from a fetus that has been killed in the womb . Allowing and condoning such donations makes us indirectly morally complicit in the act of abortion , and conveys a sense of approval for an ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bioethicists James Bopp and James Burtchaell have said , " whatever the researcher 's intentions may be , by entering into an institutionalized partnership with the abortion industry as a supplier of preference , he or she becomes complicit , though after the fact , with the abortions that have expropriated the tissue for his or her purposes . " <p> Similarly , there is disagreement about the role of informed consent . There is an almost universal agreement that if a fetus died of natural causes that a parent should be able to donate fetal tissue unless the other parent objects . Additionally , many also contend , as James F. Childress notes , that , " the pregnant woman 's consent should be necessary for donationthat is , the father should not be able to authorize the donation by himself , and the mother should always be asked before fetal tissue is used . " <p> There is no unanimity of agreement , though , on the issue of consent when the tissue is obtained as the result of an abortion . Some ethicists believe that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not legal ) right to act as guardian and proxy of the cadaveric remains . Others contend that since the dead fetus has no rights or interests that need protecting , the maternal woman maintains both the moral and legal right to decide , by informed consent , how the tissue should be disposed . <p> How is fetal tissue used ? <p> Fetal tissueobtained both ethically and unethicallyhas been used to develop life-saving vaccines . The 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine , for instance , was awarded for a polio vaccine that was developed from fetal kidney cells . And fetal cells were used in the production of a widely used vaccine for measles . In both cases , the tissue was obtained from spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies . Cells from aborted fetuses , however , have been used in a number of more recent vaccines for chicken pox , hepatitis , measles , mumps , poliomyelitis , rabies , rubella , and small pox . ( For more on the ethics of vaccines , see this article . ) <p> Fetal cell were also used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . But because studies showed they werent effective , research using fetal cells for biomedical treatments has largely been abandoned . <p> " We do n't use a lot fetal tissue today , and when its used its mainly for studying some fetal disease and fetal development , " says Arthur Caplan , director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center . " Its not a key part or major part of research in the U.S. " <p> The transfer of human cadaveric tissue , including fetal tissue , is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act ( UAGA ) , which was adopted by all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the late 1960s and early 1970s . <p> An Institute of Medicine report notes that , in general , the UAGA permits either parent , subject to the known objection of the other , to donate fetal tissue , following spontaneous or deliberate abortions , for research , education , or transplantation . However , some states restrict the use of fetal materials following induced abortions in some research . Federal regulations permit research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cells , tissue , or organs excised from a dead fetus . . . in accordance with any applicable State or local laws regarding such activities " ( 45 CFR 46.210 ) . <p> Is it illegal to sell fetal tissue ? <p> It is illegal to directly sell fetal tissue . However , companies involved in the acquisition , transfer , and disposition of the tissue can be compensated for their efforts . Two laws directly cover this issue . <p> 42 U.S. Code 274e prohibits the purchase of human organs , including any organs derived from a fetus , for the purposes of human transplantation . Because the fetal tissue is likely to be used for research purposes rather than be transplanted into a living human , this law most likely does not apply . <p> In each of these laws , the term " valuable consideration " does not include " reasonable payments associated with the transportation , implantation , processing , preservation , quality control , or storage of human fetal tissue . " <p> 42 U.S. Code 289g prevents the solicitation of fetal tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fetuses gestated for research purposes . " What this means is that a buyer can not solicit fetal tissue for transplantation or use tissue from a fetus that is known to have been created solely for the purpose of aborting the baby and extracting its tissue and/or organs . <p> But this seems to cover only human tissue that was acquired when the pregnancy was " deliberately initiated to provide such tissue .

Just days after the landmark SCOTUS decision on same-sex marriage , the dominions began to teeter . Two days after the highest courts ruling , Mark Oppenheimer , the religion columnist for the New York Times , commenced a call to end tax exemptions for churches and non-profits , both secular and religious . Oppenheimer 's call was not a shock to religious leaders ; from the moment Solicitor General Verrili uttered the words , " It is going to be an issue , " it was easy to see where things are heading . <p> While the various SCOTUS decisions of 2015 will have a dramatic effect on religious institutions , other more subtle changes are threatening religious liberties . Take , for instance , the Nonprofit Revitalization Act signed into law by New York 's Governor Cuomo in December 2013 . This piece of legislation intends to correct antiquated nonprofit laws in New York while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses of the past decade in corporate America , this bill passed overwhelmingly in both the New York State House and Senate . Although there is much to be praised in this bill , one major consideration did not seem to come up : How will this legislation affect the local church ? <p> In attempts to guard against corruption , lawmakers included a provision requiring all non-profit boards to be led by a board of trustees chaired by an " Independent Director . " What is an " Independent Director ? " One who receives no compensation from the non-profit . The amendment seeks to protect nonprofits from having the board leader serving where there might be a conflict of interest . On the surface , this seems to be a wise and laudable provision ; until one considers how this might affect ecclesiological concerns . <p> With one stroke of the pen , New York State stripped many church pastors of their position as " first among equals " on their elder boards . Because New York State views the " elder board " as synonymous with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how this provision might violate a churchs ecclesiological order . On July 1 , 2014 , countless churches found themselves in violation of the law of New York State , putting their not-for-profit status in jeopardy . <p> I 'm a church planter in upstate New York . My church , like other church starts , incorporated with the board of elders acting as the governing body . In accordance with 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 , our board consists of qualified elders , called by Jesus , to serve as under-shepherds in the leadership of his church . The elder board serves as an interdependent group , but allows the lead pastor to direct the vision of the board as a first among equals . <p> The new law of New York State makes it illegal for the lead pastor to serve as the first among equals on the elder boards if that man receives compensation from the church . Subsequently , the new law strips a lead church planter or pastor from exercising their leadership gifts in a formal way . Inadvertently , New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . Under the state 's new interpretation , 1 Timothy 3:3 would read something more like this : " An elder must not be a drunkard , not be violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , and also must not receive compensation from the church for his labor . " <p> It would seem lawmakers never considered the far-reaching implications this legislation would have on a church 's right to govern itself based on the Scriptures . Of course , churches are not forced to comply with this legislation , but failure to comply would result in the loss of tax-exempt status . To comply with the law churches can choose to not register as a religious not-for-profit . Was this a goal of the legislation ? <p> While the threat of same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act present a frontal attack on the financial viability of religious non-profits , other more subtle threats are coming from our local municipalities and state legislatures .

The landscape is rapidly shifting in North America ; no longer can the church live as though it is a privileged class . <p> Wise leadership must get ahead of the curve and begin preparing for strategies that will allow the church to operate in a hostile post-Christian nation . History has not given the church examples of exile from a nation founded on Christian ethics . Therefore , the days we are entering will truly be uncharted waters .

Several speakers noted that the LGBT community thrives on networks of close , personal relationships . <p> Churches , then , must model biblical community . <p> " When a gay person walks away from their entire world , when they walk away from their sexual identity and possibly their whole identity , when they walk away from their community to pursue Jesus , they often find no one in the church to walk alongside them , " Goeke said . <p> " Shiny , well-scrubbed , secret-bearing Christianity will never foster anything except more secrets . We need to pull community out of a list of programs and graft it into the DNA of our church . " <p> Healing community , Goeke said , is messy and inconvenient , but it is also life changing for every member in the church . <p> Rosaria Butterfield , a former English professor at Syracuse University who abandoned her life as a lesbian and gay activist when she converted to Christ , echoed Goekes plea for churches to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife who befriended her and welcomed her into their lives as they demonstrated and discussed the gospel with her . <p> Butterfield , author of The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert , stressed that just like every person who repents and believe in Christ , those coming out of homosexuality are exchanging their old identity for a new identity in Christ , yet this transition is not simple . <p> Jackie Hill Perry , who also was a lesbian before coming to Christ , explained that the gospel creates community , saving individuals into communities of people called local churches . For this reason , she encouraged Christians who struggle with same-sex attraction to pursue friendships in the church . <p> " If God has said and created people with roles that will equip us and mature us , " Perry said , " then those of us who are struggling cant decide , I 'm going to grow apart from the way God taught me to grow.

@@100509403 @4709403/ <h> A biblical case against gambling <p> Anti-Gambling Sunday is September 21 . To download a free bulletin insert go here . <p> A dear pastor friend of mine who , like me , finds himself of necessity involved in trying to keep casino gambling out of Kentucky asked me to share some biblical reasons why I believe gambling is wrong . I actually wrote most of the following in 2005 and it was published in the Western Recorder . In order that it might contribute to the debate that now consumes our state , as well as inform some of my students who think it an adiapherous avocation , I share it once again with the conviction that a follower of Christ has no business gambling . <p> Simply put , gambling is sin . <p> If no passage of Scripture explicitly forbids it , can we with confidence claim that gambling is wrong , a moral evil , sin ? With good reason , Christians are hesitant to label sins that the Bible does n't  mention , yet we often have to distill principles from the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacking , or cheating on tests are n't  mentioned in the Bible either , yet believers who want to live like Jesus know intuitively and correctly that these behaviors run counter to the will of God . While biblical texts may not mention them explicitly , biblical principles speak to them directly . <p> In the same way , the ethics of Scripture clearly teach that gambling is wrong and a sin against God , not for one single reason but for many . The slot machine , casino , or poker table are not for believers submitted to the Lordship of Christ . <p> Many Christians object that if they budget a certain amount of their discretionary entertainment funds for gambling and do n't  go beyond that , what 's the harm ? After all , Christian people waste money on all kinds of diversions . Far from convincing me that gambling is not necessarily wrong , this particular argument actually confirms it in my mind , because it reveals a complete disregard for what ones participation in gambling does to others . This argument reveals a self-centeredness and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find disturbing ( Rom. 14:21 ) . In reality , even Christians who are not personally hurt by it are not free to participate in an industry that preys on the weak and the poor . <p> The Bible is full of references to Gods view of economics . In the garden of Eden , even before sin entered the world , God established a work ethic by which humanity was to exist ( Gen. 1:28-30 ) Part of Gods creation of man in his own image was that man would work for his food . While God provided it , Adam and Eve had to exercise " dominion " over the plants and animals and till the soil , working for their sustenance . After they sinned , work changed to a more laborious task , but it remained the way God provided for them . In other words , Gods way is that we should earn what we get . <p> Think about these reasons why gambling violates Christian principles : <p> Working and investing for a living is based on a win/win scenario , but gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on commerce and work . When a carpenter builds a cabinet and gets paid , both parties win . One of them gets the cabinets she wanted , and one of them gets the money he desired . They can both feel good about the transaction . Not so with gambling . Someone always loses and pays a price . <p> Gambling is motivated by greed . Let 's be honest and admit that greed lies at the heart of all gambling . The desire to get something for nothing is really another name for covetousness ( Exod. 20:17 ; Prov. 21:25-26 ) . <p> Gambling is a wasteful use of the Lords money . I doubt that many Christians who gamble tithe , but even if they do , New Testament Christians understand that God does n't  have the right to only ten percent of our money , but all of it . Even though I am a tither , I am still required to be a steward of all I have because it belongs to God . I am no freer to gamble with Gods money than I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lords money on equally frivolous things , their sin does n't  excuse mine . <p> Gambling shows a lack of love for my neighbor . If I really love my neighbor , I want only what is for his good ( Matt. 22:39 , 1 Cor. 10:24 ) . When legislators talk about putting casinos on the state line so we can prey on the greed and weakness of our neighbors , they reveal the harmful assault that gambling really is . Can I in good conscience support something that preys on the weaknesses and indulges the worst instincts of the precious people around me ? Gambling fails to consider innocent families . We might be tempted to think that if a person gambles away all of his money , then that is his problem and serves him right . But what of his ten-year-old son who ca n't afford school supplies ? What of his wife who has to work to pay off the credit cards she did n't  even know she had ? What of his ailing parents who can not count on his help in their senior years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " A greedy man brings trouble to his family , " and nowhere is that more obvious than in the gambling industry . <p> Gambling shows no concern for Gods glory . A Jesus-follower should try to glorify God in everything ( 1 Cor. 10:31 ) , and use his or her money to accomplish good for the kingdom ( Matt. 6:19-21 , 24 ) . <p> Gambling is not an act of faith but a game of chance . Paul wrote that " Everything that is not of faith is sin " ( Romans 14:23 ) . The Christian life is to be lived in dependence on God to meet all needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus ( Phil . 4:19 ) . <p> Jesus would n't do it .

Requiring all citizens to support same-sex marriage and punishing those who do not complywhether in private or public capacityis not a move that allows for true diversity and freedom to flourish . According to a recent poll , 59 percent of Americans are opposed to denying religious freedom in instances in cases involving photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies . And for good reason : Religious freedom is at the heart of all other freedoms . The ruling like the one issued in Colorado is the not the product of a country where personal freedom is given room to settle matters without recourse to litigation . <p> As David Harsanyi writes at The Federalist , it is worth observing what Jack Phillips did n't  do : <p> He did n't  query costumers about their sexual preferences . He did n't  bar same-sex couples from purchasing a cake at a place of public accommodation . He did n't  ask consumers traveling in same-sex pairs to leave his shop . He did n't  hang a No Gays Allowed sign in his window . <p> Let 's be very clear : Phillips in no way engaged in any form of discrimination . Under politicized and highly subjective categories of " sexual orientation , " the full weight of the law is being used to punish Phillips for doing no wrong . He did n't  deny service on the grounds of the plaintiffs homosexuality . Refusing service has nothing to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the complicity of what the plaintiffs asked of Phillips is entirely appropriate . <p> Additionally , as Harsanyi rightly observes , the appeals court played the part of mind reader and stepped into the arena of refereeing theological claims by deciding what is or is n't a legitimate claim of religious conviction and concern . Sincere claims that bother the conscience is not for the authority of any court to decide , as Justice Alito noted in the 2014 Hobby Lobby decision . <p> Those praising the courts ruling do so on the grounds that refusing service for a same-sex wedding ceremony is tantamount to a regime of systemic discrimination . This is resoundingly false . No laws deny gay individuals access to public goods . Had they allowed for diverse viewpoints , the plaintiffs in this situation could have taken the honorable route and taken their money to a bakery that has no religious or moral conflict in helping provide services for a same-sex wedding ceremony . <p> The principle of coercion that the court and liberals unwittingly adopt in arguments like these undermine the very notion of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency owned by an LGBT individual be required to make marketing materials for a biblical marriage rally ? Of course not . Should a Muslim web developer be required to his or her web developing skills to build a website for a pornographer ? Absolutely not . But because same-sex marriage enjoys privileged political status , no court is willing to step in and make accurate truth claims about suspect legal categories , the nature of religious liberty , and personal freedom . <p> Tolerance has become a leftist synonym for coercion , and activists and employing these words in hopes that repeated use of it will cudgel citizens into compliance . What must be done at this point is simple : Refuse to comply with the newfound orthodoxy . Dare to tell the truth about marriage . Dare to assert the timeless truth that men and women are different . Defend Jack Phillips against an encroaching state that plays politics with constitutional protections . Insist upon the rights of religious freedomespecially in the face of bad court rulings. 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170

Why is this an important issue for evangelical churches to consider ? <p> The gospel does n't  come to us solely as individuals . Were saved as individuals , of course , but the Christian life is lived out , more often than not , as spouses , so marriage is at the heart of our churches .

Why is that the case ? <p> The ship has sailed on subjects like same-sex marriage , but one reason it has is because we 've fostered a " Happily Ever After " view of marriage in our churches . We 've largely over-emphasized the personal dynamics of marriage and under-emphasized , almost totally , the public dynamic of marriage . Marriage is connected to personal holiness , of course , but its also tied to , for example , rates of abuse , neglect , and educational outcomes in our communities . Christians have a great opportunity to cast a larger vision for marriage not only in our churches , but also in our communities . <p> This conference seeks to apply the gospel to issues related to human sexuality . What are some ways the gospel relates to biblical marriage ? <p> At the center of the universe , there 's a marriage banquet where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage in Genesis 2 , to the gospel-revealing contours of marriage in Ephesians 5 , the Scriptures suggestmysteriouslythat marriage makes the gospel intelligible .

We treat divorce as a spiritual blightwhich it is ! But in the wake of a divorce , there 's a host of lost relationships and a breakdown in human capital that makes life so much harder . Chiefly , I want to see pastors and congregants confront the breakdown or deterioration of marriage in their own congregation . From there , though , I hope I can cast a vision of marriage that connects the personal aspects of marriage to the public aspects of marriage . 43169 @qwx903169 43181 @qwx903181 43187 @qwx903187 43178 @qwx903178 
@@100509407 @4709407/ <h> How can we respond to the problem of sex trafficking ? <p> How can we respond biblically and practically to the problem of sex trafficking ? The book of Ephesians provides four challenges for what we can do as evangelicals who love the gospel , love people , and want to follow Jesus and flood the darkness with light . In Ephesians , the fifth chapter in particular , Paul talks about the theme of darkness and light . When we look at this book , we are reminded that in the middle of all this darkness were the saintsthis little colony of the kingdom , this little outpost that was to shine the light of truth and love to a sex-filled culture . Here are the four ways we can do just that : <p> 1 . Stop Looking at Porn : Our first challenge as Gods people who walk in the light is to endand we need to encourage our people to endour involvement with every form of porneia . As Ephesians 5:3 says , there should n't be a hint of it . <p> Verse 6the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Verse 7dont associate with people in it . <p> Verse 8become who you are . <p> If you want to help fight sex trafficking , stop looking at porn . I do n't  think people make this connection . The eighteen-month-old baby who is sold , the girl who is trafficked at the Atlanta airport , and your pornography addiction are related . You can have a college student who wants to fight sex trafficking , but has a pornography addiction . There is a massive disconnect there . <p> Pornography is creating the demand for sex trafficking , and in many ways , its a gateway drug to sex trafficking . I believe if you are looking at pornography , you are perpetuating the problem of sex trafficking . You are involved in sex trafficking . Many of the ladies that men , and also women , view are victims of sex trafficking . Martin Luther King , Jr. , says , " Darkness can not drive out darkness : only light can do that . " You want to affect the dark world of trafficking ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell our friends , and we need to tell our churches , to end every involvement they have with porneia . <p> 2 . Live a Righteous Life : Endeavor by Gods power to live a life of goodness , righteousness , and truth . Live an everyday life of justice . Paul says , " For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Walk as children of lightfor the fruit of the light results in all goodness , righteousness , and truth " ( Eph 5:89 ) . In these trio of terms , Paul almost summarizes Christian ethics . All that is good and right and true is what the Christian is to be about . We do n't  simply go do justice ; we live a life of justice . We do n't  simply do good ; we live a life of goodness . Out of lives of holiness and justice and goodness and truth , we affect darkness . In all of our dealings with people , we should pursue justice . <p> I love the concept that Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on righteousness and it clothed me . My justice was like a robe and a turban . " He says : I wear justice . I put on justice like you put on clothes . I live with a social conscience . I live every day of my life looking out for the oppressed , looking out for the vulnerable , looking to be honest in all of my dealings . We should put justice on every day . Use your gifts . Use your abilities . Use your rhythms . Use your vocation in a way that can make a difference . For example : <p> You could contact lawmakers and advocate for this issue . <p> You could become a lawyer devoted to prosecuting these cases , which the vulnerable all around the world desperately need . <p> You could support local police enforcement . <p> Business professionals could address issues of poverty , which often perpetuate the problem of sex trafficking , by doing business as mission . <p> We could provide vocational training for people who are vulnerable . <p> We could do foster care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could provide basic hospitality for the snotty-nosed kid down the street whose dad is in jail and mom is on crack . <p> I also believe churches need to consider developing aftercare facilities and ministries . It is one of the best ways we can minister in this world of sex trafficking . Not all of us can be lawyers or politicians , but when these girls are rescued , they need to see what a family looks like . They need the gospel . They need to come into a worshipping community and see what that 's like . <p> In addition , please do background checks on volunteers and practice church discipline wisely and faithfully in your local church . Report suspected abuse to the proper authorities . The National Human Trafficking Resource Center , which is managed by the Polaris Project in Washington , D.C. , can be reached at ( 888 ) 373-7888 and is a good resource . Use this number to report a tip . You can also connect with anti-trafficking services in your area and request training with this number . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark world . Ephesians 5:11 says , " Take no part in unfruitful works of darkness , but instead expose them . " Believers are to not participate in sexual sin , and we do n't  keep our light under a bushel , either . We flood the world with light , exposing the sin of unbelievers . This word " expose " in the Greek means to correct or convince . Paul does not tell us here how we ought to expose those shameful sins that people are doing in secret , but surely it means by our words and our deeds . This will be different for everyone . <p> I follow the Good Samaritan principle on this . We cant do everything , but we can meet needs in our area . What can be done to expose the problem ? How can you use words ? How can you use your deeds ? We will all answer this differently , but we cant live with our head in the sand . Perhaps you would form a justice team in your local church or do a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to evaluate your own context . You could contact local services and ask how you can help them . Live your life with your eyes open . <p> 4 . Evangelize : We need to evangelize those in darkness . Light not only exposes sin , but it transforms unbelievers into the realm of light . That is the beauty of the gospel . How does the gospel overcome sex trafficking ? It combats two of Satans primary works : Satan is an accuser and a deceiver . The gospel brings truth that exposes this deception . Out of love , God convicts us of sin and leads us to repentance . The gospel brings to bear truth that tells people , " You cant live under this deception . This is sin . " <p> The gospel also works against the accusations of the devil , who tells these victims , " You are nothing . " Many of these victims feel an enormous sense of shame and brokenness . The gospel says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and that we stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sense of wholeness . It is the power of God unto salvation that can transform even the perpetrators lives , who are , ironically , slaves themselves . J. B. Phillips translates Eph. 5:14 like this , " Its even possible ( after all , it happened to you ! ) for light to turn the thing it shines upon into light also . " When the gospel goes into dark places , it can transform people into the realm of light . <p> Remember these few things when you think about evangelism . God transformed many in this Ephesian congregation who had come out of this lifestyle . This church was probably filled with those individuals . The gospel even transformed Paul who wrote this letter . Some need to hear the gospel when they are freed and others need to be freed in order to hear the gospel . I have seen both happen . <p> You can draw a tight connection to the book of Exodus where God says : I want my people to go so that they may worship mebecause its hard to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its hard to worship when you are so crushed with despair that you are just trying to survive . So often , you hear people say we should be about proclamation . I agree . Alleviating eternal suffering is primary to temporal suffering , but they cant hear our proclamation when they are on drugs and are raped six times a day . For many of the two million underage people trapped in trafficking , we have to work to free them in order for them to hear the gospel . <p> We must pursue , as best as we can , an integrative model of mission that takes both physical and spiritual needs seriously . We want to alleviate temporal suffering , and we definitely want to alleviate eternal suffering . Jesus did n't  wake up every day and ask , " Should I do justice or evangelism today ? " No , Jesus went out and loved his neighbor , and that involved bothcaring for the totality of a person . <p> Why should we care about this problem ? If we care about the Bible , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all need to prayerfully apply the teaching of the Bible in areas that are uncomfortable for us , conforming our lives to the whole of the Bible . Sex trafficking is the fastest growing crime in the world , and it is a world of demonic darkness , filled with the schemes of the devil .

Given your near-immediate response to most big news stories , never missing a chance to offer a hot take on the most pressing issue of the day , I would not have thought you needed a few weeks to post something about what the medical director of Planned Parenthood said on that video . Still , maybe you were busy or on vacation , I thought . <p> But , like I said , it has been weeks . <p> I know you to be a sensitive person , open to hear the other side of the debate , but I am starting to wonder . <p> Throughout the spring and early summer leading up to the Supreme Courts Obergefell decision , your social media handles lit up with posts celebrating the American shift toward a redefinition of marriage : you cheered in favor of Tony Campolo 's newly-found support of same sex marriage ; you stifled a smile when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate monogamous same sex couples as members , and you seemed to retweet any story that indicated a break among evangelicals on the issue .

In theory , you get what is so deeply wrong about what we are doing to ourselves as a people , as a nation , when we allow and fund such an atrocity .

I do not deny that this issue like much of life can be confusing , particularly when so many people in positions of power in society do not seem to think abortion is a big deal . But surely it is not as nuanced as the discussion about gender and sexuality that we have seen in the United States over the past few years . If I remember correctly , the narrow 5-4 decision in the Obergefell case did not dissuade you from triumphantly rainbowing your profile picture on facebook . <p> Is it because you think American culture is moving in another direction , one that supports gay marriage and abortion rights , and as an evangelical you do not want to burn any bridges with those to whom you are ministering ? Perhaps you see your selective advocacy as another way in which you are seeking the shalom of the city into which you have been sent by God ( Jer 29:7 ) . To be honest , I hope this is the case , because it leaves open the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If this is your position , then I would like to suggest that rarely do we see such acquiescence in the Scripture , particularly among those in exile ( the community to whom Jer 29:7 is written ) . The general model of faithfulness in exile found in the Bible encourages a peaceable strength that speaks inconvenient truths to power even if it means negative consequences . In their best moments , Daniel , the three Judahite youths , Ezra , Nehemiah , and Esther operate within their various and sundry contexts to the glory of God and in faithfulness to the covenant even when it meant public ridicule and derision , and it often meant just that . Likewise Christian exiles ( 1 Pet 1:1 ) in the New Testament were no strangers to contextualization of the gospel ( 1 Cor 9:20 ) , but that never means subverting the teaching of Scripture on the basic aspects of human identity for the sake of public acceptance . <p> Does it bother you that your selective public posturing puts you in perfect alignment with the most substantial power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel of Jesus Christ ? <p> That is an honest question . I have often wondered about you , about what you really think of us . If you are confident that you are in the right , then the vast majority of those whom you call brother and sister are not only in the wrong but deeply deluded by false beliefs pertaining to the nature of humanity and its relationship to one another and God . If this is your opinion , please make your case . Play the role of the prophet , and show us from Scripture how we have gotten this so wrong . If you do not have the capacity for that kind of argumentation , point us to the ones who do , the ones who convinced you . <p> I do not expect a thorough biblical defense of Planned Parenthood 's activities , and I think we both know why . <p> The modern predicament presents many challenges to the believing community , and our response will require a certain amount of trial and error .

@@100509411 @4709411/ <h> The Baptist alliance with Thomas Jefferson that secured religious liberty <p> In 1776 , long-persecuted Baptists hoped that the American Revolution would not only secure Americas liberty , but bring about full religious freedom . Thomas Jefferson and James Madison became their key allies in fulfilling that ambition . Jeffersons collaboration with the Bible-believing Baptists was spiritually ironic . He remained relatively quiet about his religious skepticism during his political career , but in truth Jefferson did not believe in the resurrection of Christ or that Jesus was the Son of God . Nevertheless , in 1802 President Jefferson appealed for religious liberty in a letter that has become known as the " wall of separation the free exercise thereof , thus building a wall of separation between church and state , " Jefferson wrote . Scholars and jurists have endlessly debated and dissected the meaning of Jeffersons wall of separation . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document analysts to reveal what Jefferson had written in an earlier draft . But the recipients of the letter are interesting as well : Jefferson , the deist , was writing to some of his staunchest supporters , the Baptists of Danbury , Connecticut . These evangelical dissenters still languished under an official state denomination , eleven years after the First Amendments ban on " an establishment of religion " and guarantee of the " free exercise of religion . " Jeffersons letter demonstrated the partnership between skeptical or liberal Christian politicians , and legions of Baptists , in the cause of religious liberty . This alliance helped score the Baptists most significant success of the Revolution , the widespread disestablishment of state churches . <p> The Danbury Baptist Association was founded in 1790 as an advisory council for Baptist churches in western Connecticut . From the start , it identified " full gospel liberty " as one of its core values . But it found gospel liberty difficult to achieve because of the states continuing official support for the Congregationalist Church . Dissenters could file certificates to receive exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standards to qualify for such exemptions . Baptists thought that even filing the certificates was an obnoxious requirement and an intrusion of the state into the realm of the spirit . <p> Baptists across America rejoiced when Thomas Jefferson was elected president , because they saw Jefferson as the great champion of religious liberty , especially in light of his 1786 Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia . The Danbury Baptists wrote to Jefferson in late 1801 and congratulated him on what they saw as a providential victory over John Adams : " We have reason to believe that Americas God has raised you up to fill the chair of state out of that good will which he bears to the millions which you preside over . " They knew that Jefferson could not alter state laws by fiat , but they hoped that his commitment to religious liberty would , " like the radiant beams of the sun . . . shine and prevail through these states and all the world till hierarchy and tyranny be destroyed from the earth . " To them , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about gospel liberty , and Jeffersons election was the next milestone in that process . <p> The Republican Jefferson was delighted to have such allies in predominantly Federalist New England , and he wanted his response to the letter to sow " useful truths and principles among the people " regarding religious liberty . During the 1800 campaign , Jeffersons opponents had attacked him as a heretic , and as president he was already coming under criticism for failing , unlike his predecessors , to declare public days of prayer and fasting . He wanted to clarify that , just like the Baptists , he really did support the flourishing of religion in America . To Jefferson , the best way to support religion was to grant all citizens religious liberty . This was the ingenious compromise of the First Amendments religion clauses : the free exercise of religion required the absence of a national church . <p> In the carefully drafted letter , Jefferson wrote that because he believed " that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God , that he owes account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , " he treasured the separation of church and state enshrined in the First Amendment . He looked forward to the " progress of those sentiments " at the state level , too . But he and the Baptists would have to wait until 1818 for Connecticut to disestablish the Congregationalist Church . <p> Beginning with the Supreme Courts decision in Everson v.

The book promo says it " makes a thoughtful and passionate case for why parenthood is not the only path in life , taking our parent-centric , kid-fixated , baby-bump-patrolling culture to task in the process . " Given our increasing obsession with pets in America , our fixation on autonomy , or desire to sever every connection between sex and procreation , its almost nonsensical that a group of elite writers would feel the need to defend their decision to forgo babies . And yet , they do . <p> Where , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel so pressured by ? Los Angeles ? Brooklyn ? New York City ? Venice Beach ? Its hard to imagine the neighborhoods these award-winning writers occupy being overrun by the " overwhelming cultural pressure of parenthood " their book claims to counter . <p> Even in our Bible-belty town , I 've felt out-of-place entering a restaurant , market , or boutique with our four children . And elsewhere , especially while awkwardly guiding our four kids through first-class on our way to coach seats on a crowded airplane , I 've wished they had t-shirts that reminded people simply , " You were this age once . " I know I 'm not alone . <p> As far back as 2008 , the National Marriage Projects report , " Life Without Children , " warned that America was shifting away from supporting parents in the hard and essential work of raising the next generation . David Popenoe and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead wrote , <p> " We are in the midst of a profound change in American life . Demographically , socially and culturally , the nation is shifting from a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The repercussions of this change are apparent in nearly every domain of American life . " <p> Last week a story in The Atlantic added more evidence . In " The Childless Millennial , " Olga Khazan summarized findings from the Urban Institute that " today 's twenty-something women have been slower to have children than any previous generation . " Far from calling millennials to get with the program and absent any " pressure to parent , " this story said the significant downturn is nothing to worry about . <p> Having a child and giving yourself to parenting requires a level of self-sacrifice rarely endorsed , let alone imposed , in our day . According to Popenoe and Whitehead , <p> Indeed , child-rearing valuessacrifice , stability , dependability , maturityseem stale and musty by comparison to the " child-free " values .

Indeed , what it takes to raise children is almost the opposite of what popularly defines a satisfying adult life . <p> Yet for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the entertainment arena , the authors of Selfish , Shallow , and Self-Absorbed are defensive against somethingor someone . On some level , it seems as if they feel the need to justify their decision not to have children . <p> Someone once sacrificed for you <p> I think their angst points to the metaphysical musing : Why am I here ? What am I supposed to do with my life ? The practical answer is that you 're here because your parents , in a moment of passion , conceived you . Someone carried you , bore you , nursed you , clothed you , taught you , and hopefully , loved you . No one can completely forget that someone once sacrificed so we could be here . Every person owes their life to someone else . Someone once given life , who refuses the miracle to another , must , at some level , feel the weight of their decision . <p> This is one of those truths we cant unlearn .

I 'm not saying that everyone who does n't  have children has consciously made the decision not to . Many childless men and women long to have children but face circumstances beyond their control . But regardless of our circumstances , we must continue to be a voice for children ; for having them and for training them in the fear of the Lord . <p> We should also pray for the authors of this book , and those who will read it looking for encouragement to stay the self-seeking path .

Scripture says children are a blessing . What it does n't  say is that children will always make you happy or fulfilled . We need children precisely because we are selfish . <p> The incredible challenges that come with parenting can completely undo you , but as Allan Carlson writes in The Natural Family , it " opens the portals to the good life , to true happiness , even to bliss . . . .

@@100509415 @4709415/ <h> Something greater than marriage : A response to the SCOTUS decision <p> The Supreme Court of the United States of America has made gay marriage legal in all 50 states and much of our country celebrates . The world with its rainbow flags waving proudly and plentifully was our world . We locked arms with our LGBT loved ones and friends and believed that they were truly and honestly our family of choice . <p> This is the world that we , Christopher and Rosaria , helped builda world pursuing dignity and equality . The people you see celebrating the recent SCOTUS decision to redefine marriage ( and with marriage , personhood ) would have been us , not very long ago . <p> In 1999 , when Jesus Christ revealed his saving grace and love to each of us , we learned that our unbelief , and the idolatrous sexual lusts that flowed from it , were no longer matters of personal choice . We accepted that following Jesus meant giving up everything . We understood that repentance meant fleeing from anything that embodied the temptations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our conversion to Christ , God provided the love and care of Christians , people who became for us a new family , new brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers in Christwho knew and loved us before we were safe to love . Christians loved , accepted , included and surrounded us with biblical truth while we were still sinners , thus modeling the Lord himself . Therefore , when the Holy Spirit changed our hearts , we came to know this : the gospel is costly and worth it . <p> The days after the Supreme Court 's ruling are like the days before it : God is seated on his throne in power and majestyand one day , every knee will bow and every tongue will confess him . <p> We affirm that God has ordained marriage to be the union of a husband and a wife which Jesus himself restated in Mark 10:6-8 and Matthew 19:4-5 . But even though some in our culture believe as Justice Kennedy wrote that marriage " embodies the highest ideals of love , " we disagree . Earthly marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ( 1 John 4:7-19 ) . The pinnacle of love is Gods love for us in Christ . Nothing is greater than that . <p> In actuality , marriage is a mystery and a reflection of a greater reality . Truly , the highest ideal of love is Christs love for his bride , the church . In Ephesians 5 and Revelation 21 , marriage is analogous to Christ 's redemption : the marriage consummation between the bride ( redeemed sinners ) and the Groom ( Christ ) shows that all redeemed people are married to Christ . Only in Christ can anyone experience the full definition of love and acceptance . As important as earthly marriage and family are , they are both fleetingly temporary , while Christ and the family of God ( the church ) are wondrously eternal . <p> We have failed to show the LGBT community another option to marriagewhich is singlenesslived out in the fruitful and full context of God 's community , the family of God . This does not mean as Justice Kennedy wrote that singles are " condemned to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fulfilling relationships full of love . This is not a consolation prize . It can be just as rewarding and fulfilling as marriage . <p> Defining marriage as being between a husband and a wife appears unfair to the LGBT community , in part because a life of singleness is viewed to be crushingly lonely . Have we in the church inadvertently played into that lie with our idolatry of marriage while being pejorative and silent toward singleness ? If singleness is unfair , then it is no wonder that marriage has become a right . Just as the LGBT community appealed to the rest of the world for dignity and respect , it is time for the church to fight for the dignity and respect of single women and single men . <p> Some are now comparing the Supreme Courts decision on gay marriage with the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion . There is an important lesson for us to learn from the pro-life movement . Today , there are more pro-life millennials thanothers from previous generations who champion pro-life . When pro-life people , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less and caring more for unborn babies and for women with unplanned pregnancies just as they were , a shift in focus brought about an important change . The question stands : will we begin caring for the LGBT community just as they are ? <p> This is a defining moment in history . We have a faithful opportunity to shine for the gospel . Will we point people to marriage as the " highest ideal of love " ? Or will we point peoplewhether married or singleto a life of costly discipleship pursuing the embodiment of love , Jesus Christ himself ?

Avoid nationalism and racism , and ask God to give you concern for your city and country ( Jonah 4:1011 ) <p> " Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez " sounds a bit different than " John Doe . " It is obviously a Muslim name . You can tell he is of Middle Eastern descent just by looking at his picture . Most of us recognize that racism is a problem in our country . But a sin that is less discussed is nationalismthe belief that you and your country are better than someone when you compare your country to theirs . But the danger with comparing yourself with someone else is that it leads to you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiency in Christ . <p> The prophet Jonah saw a revival come to Ninevah , and instead of celebrating of what God did through his ministry , he threw a pity party because people who did n't  look or sound like him received salvation . His bigotry superseded his theology . God concludes the book of Jonah by explaining His merciful heart for the Assyrian people . Let 's learn from Jonahs mistake , and instead of falling into the temptations of nationalism and racism , ask God to give us concern for the people of our city and our country who come from every tribe , tongue and nation . <p> 2 . Ask God to give peace and prosperity to your city and country ( Jeremiah 29:7 ) <p> Tourism has an $893.3 million economic impact on Chattanooga ( Travel Industry Association of America ) . Needless to say , the idea of loading up the kids and driving to visit the Chattanooga Choo Choo may be a bit hard to swallow considering a terrorist just opened fire here . <p> Following terroristic activity , it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes my fellow conservative friends get the heebeegeebees at the mention of the word " prosperity . " They automatically associate it with the name-it-and-claim-it vein of theology . That 's not what I 'm talking about here . I 'm talking about asking God to provide economic health to an otherwise vulnerable situation that could threaten the welfare of our neighbors . <p> 3 . Pray for your city to become a place of refuge and rest instead of a place of terror ( Psalm 5:11 ) <p> I want my city to be a place of refuge and no longer a place of terror . Yesterday , Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam addressed the sadness of the scenic city when he said , " Chattanooga is a great city with a broken heart . " Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said , " This is a tragic day for our city . " Yes , we have been terrorized . I will not leave my house today with the same carefree attitude as I did the day before . However , it does n't  have to stay that way . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people can come to find a message of Hope and the rest they long for . <p> 4 . Pray for God to use this tragedy to stir up conversations about Jesus ( 1 Thessalonians 1:9 ) <p> The Apostle Paul spoke of the Thessalonians proclamation of Jesus to the Macedonians and Achaians , but then it went everywhere , and they received a " warm reception " when talking about Jesus . My prayer is that God would help us in the midst of this tragedy to have a warm reception as we seek to talk about Jesus . After all , this is the kind of time when people start thinking about their own life and death . May God give evangelistic opportunities in the midst of hurting hearts and trembling souls . <p> 5 . Pray for revival ( Jonah 3:6-10 ) <p> Lastly , this tragedy should be a reminder of the need for the Holy Spirit to cause revival to sweep across America and the world .

@@100509417 @4709417/ <h> The top 10 religious liberty threats for Christian higher education <p> In the wake of the recent Supreme Court marriage ruling , risks to religious liberty for Christian higher educational institutions have gained increased attention . During the oral arguments for the case , Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said religious liberty was " certainly going to be an issue " for schools that oppose same-sex marriage . <p> But much of the discussion about religious liberty risks for schools is abstract and theoretical . What are the particular areas where religious liberty could be threatened at a Christian college or seminary ? What are the specific religious liberty risks for Christian higher education ? Here is a brief sketch of the top 10 religious liberty threats for Christian schools : <p> Accreditation issues : Christian schools face increased scrutiny from their accreditors . Look no further than Gordon Colleges experience over the past year , which included a probe from their accrediting agency . As the Department of Education likely adjusts sexual orientation and gender identity policies in light of the Supreme Court ruling , it puts federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that could jeopardize accreditation . <p> Tax issues : Christian schools have become ground zero for controversies over whether religious institutions should be able to retain tax-exempt status . With calls already developing to strip tax-exempt status from religious ministries , Christian campuses are at heightened risk . Because many schools have sprawling campuses , the property tax consequences alone of losing tax-exempt status could be devastating . <p> Financial issues : One of the greatest threats to Christian schools is the potential financial costs of religious liberty consequences . The most commonly cited financial risk is the potential elimination of federal funding such as pell grants . But research grant writing and other revenue sources could also be at risk . Most importantly , access to the federal student loan system could be in danger . Tuition revenue generated from students using federally funded loans makes up a much higher percentage of a schools budget than direct federal funding to the school . <p> Donor issues : Because private Christian education depends heavily on generous donors , there are increased risks for schools . If a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make tax-deductible gifts , which could limit giving . But , the more immediate risk is the potential for donor stigma if their gifts to a conservative school are vilified in the public . Can donors afford the potential reputational risk of giving to a Christian school ? <p> External relations issues : There are growing risks with external constituencies such as denominations and alumni . Alumni backlash over conservative policies is evident even at schools such as Wheaton College . Denominational risks could develop if schools become out of step with the shifting perspective of their denomination . <p> Student issues : The student body ramifications are legion . How can schools establish and enforce a student conduct code forbidding homosexual practice without creating the perception of discrimination ? If schools provide married student housing , can they restrict same-sex married couples from using it ? Will the NCAA mandate conformity on sexuality issues in order for schools to participate in organized college athletics ? <p> Community issues : As the community around Christian schools shifts , their views on marriage and sexuality will be increasingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students lost access to service in the local school district , there may be consequences for partnerships between schools and their communities . While many schools are currently perceived as a benefit to their community , they may be increasingly seen as a liability . <p> Recruiting and retention issues : Student and faculty recruiting and retention may become more difficult for Christian schools . Will students be willing to attend and graduate from a college facing increasing cultural marginalization ? Will Christian schools be able to deny entry to prospective students who identify as gay or are in a same-sex marriage ? Will prospective faculty or staff members be willing to come on board when they know that ( 1 ) the viability of Christian higher education is increasingly at risk and ( 2 ) working for a conservative school could hamper their future job prospects in the academy ? <p> Employment issues : Hiring practices for Christian schools are now in the crosshairs . Will schools be able to hire faculty and staff in accordance with their Christian convictions ? Additionally , job placement for graduates could become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture for its conservative views on marriage . <p> Doctrinal issues : The Supreme Court ruling will force a crisis of doctrine for many Christian schools that havent solidified their confessional convictions . Schools that lack a clear statement of faith and policies are at greater risk of institutional crisis . As schools seek to clarify and solidify their doctrinal stance , they face the potential for controversy and fracturing amongst their administration , faculty , staff , and students . <p> For those who are invested in the future of Christian higher education , these are the top 10 areas where schools face religious liberty threats . Granted , all of these issues may not materializeand certainly not all at the same school . But they are the areas with the most potential for risk . <p> As Christian colleges and seminaries look to the future , they must think through their strategy in each of these 10 categories to determine how they will overcome the religious liberty risks created by the recent Supreme Court marriage ruling . 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170 
@@100509418 @4709418/ <h> The Supreme Court and religious liberty : Reason for concern <p> In the aftermath of todays Supreme Court ruling , attention is turning to how the Courts ruling will affect the religious liberty of those who disagree with the Supreme Courts redefinition of marriage . <p> Consider : Now that the United States government recognizes same-sex marriage as a fundamental right , how will those rights conflict with the large percentage of Americans who disagree with same-sex marriage and view it immoral or even harmful ? How will institutions committed to upholding a biblical or philosophical truth concerning marriage and sexuality be treated when these institutions oppose official government position ? <p> As when oral arguments occurred and the governments Solicitor General admitted that same-sex marriage would pose enormous consequence for religious institutions , the fruits of todays decision offers legitimate reason to be concerned , even if elements of the decision seem reasonable and respectful of religious opinion . <p> In the majority opinion , Justice Kennedy , who authored the majority opinion , appears to extend a measure of respect to those whose consciences or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises , and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here . But when that sincere , personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy , the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied . Under the Constitution , same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples , and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right . <p> In Kennedys view , the right to hold ones beliefs about marriage remain intact . The conflict arises , however , when individuals work through democratic channels to deny what the majority opinion considers a fundamental liberty . This notion tragically , and as Justice Scalia notesmistakenlyadopts the idea that religious practice is something merely personal or idiosyncratic , rather than seen as something fundamental to a persons worldview . It divorces ones faith from taking action . <p> Kennedy continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who adhere to religious doctrines , may continue to advocate with utmost , sincere conviction that , by divine precepts , same-sex marriage should not be condoned . The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths , and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered . The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons . In turn , those who believe allowing same- sex marriage is proper or indeed essential , whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief , may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate . The Constitution , however , does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex . <p> According to Kennedy , even in a regime of same-sex marriage , the First Amendment should be firmly upheld and the rights of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging , and the deference that Kennedy makes in upholding the good will of those involved in such disputes seems encouraging . <p> But that 's not the whole story . <p> Indeed , compared with the soaring righteousness of Kennedys rhetoric , his concerns with protecting religious liberty appear as an afterthought to his larger concern of constructing a concept of liberty premised on a suspect , morally-flawed understanding of personal autonomy . <p> Kennedys nod to religious liberty left those in the minority unhappy and fearful for what a regime based on expressive sexual liberty will do , in the long , to those who object to a worldview of seemingly limitless sexual freedom . <p> In his dissent , Chief Justice Roberts expressed concern and a measure of indignant rebuke to the Court on this matter . In particular , he takes issue with Kennedys construction of religious liberty as something abstract , rather than practiced . <p> Todays decision , for example , creates serious questions about religious liberty . Many good and decent people oppose same-sex marriage as a tenet of faith , and their freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually spelled out in the Constitution . Respect for sincere religious conviction has led voters and legislators in every State that has adopted same-sex marriage democratically to include accommodations for religious practice . The majoritys decision imposing same- sex marriage can not , of course , create any such accommodations . The majority graciously suggests that religious believers may continue to " advocate " and " teach " their views of marriage . The First Amendment guarantees , however , the freedom to " exercise " religion . Ominously , that is not a word the majority uses . Hard questions arise when people of faith exercise religion in ways that may be seen to conflict with the new right to same-sex marriagewhen , for example , a religious college provides married student housing only to opposite-sex married couples , or a religious adoption agency declines to place children with same-sex married couples . Indeed , the Solicitor General candidly acknowledged that the tax exemptions of some religious institutions would be in question if they opposed same-sex marriage . <p> Roberts goes on : <p> There is little doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , people of faith can take no comfort in the treatment they receive from the majority today . Perhaps the most discouraging aspect of todays decision is the extent to which the majority feels compelled to sully those on the other side of the debate . The majority offers a cursory assurance that it does not intend to disparage people who , as a matter of conscience , can not accept same- sex marriage . That disclaimer is hard to square with the very next sentence , in which the majority explains that " the necessary consequence " of laws codifying the traditional definition of marriage is to " demean or stigmatize " same-sex couples . The majority reiterates such characterizations over and over . By the majoritys account , Americans who did nothing more than follow the understanding of marriage that has existed for our entire historyin particular , the tens of millions of people who voted to reaffirm their States enduring definition of marriagehave acted to " lock . . . out , " " disparage , " " disrespect and subordinate , " and inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These apparent assaults on the character of fairminded people will have an effect , in society and in court . Moreover , they are entirely gratuitous . It is one thing for the majority to conclude that the Constitution protects a right to same-sex marriage ; it is something else to portray everyone who does not share the majoritys " better informed understanding " as bigoted . <p> According to Roberts , the majoritys support for religious liberty does n't  square with how they 've characterized those who disagree with same-sex marriage . In short : How can religious liberty be upheld if its the source for hardship that the Supreme Court is seeking to protect ? Who will winhurt feelings or religious liberty ? <p> Justice Alito expressed concern that the ascendency of same-sex marriage will " vilify " those who " dissent " from such a belief .

The implications of this analogy will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent . Perhaps recognizing how its reasoning may be used , the majority attempts , toward the end of its opinion , to reassure those who oppose same-sex marriage that their rights of conscience will be protected . We will soon see whether this proves to be true . I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes , but if they repeat those views in public , they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments , employers , and schools . <p> The system of federalism established by our Constitution provides a way for people with different beliefs to live together in a single nation .

@@100509419 @4709419/ <h> What the Gospel Has to Say to Transgendered Persons <p> The Spring 2015 edition of the Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood has just been released . And one of the recurring themes in that journal is transgenderism . Addressing some of the medical implications of transgender surgery , Craig Kline , M.D. and David Schrock have co-written a piece entitled , " What is Gender Reassignment Surgery ? A Medical Assessment and Biblical Appraisal . " What follows is the biblical and ethical conclusion to that article . <p> ***** It may be surprising to discover how much the Bible speaks about surgery on the genitalia . Among the many instances , the most prolific concerns the topic of circumcision . Beginning with the Abrahamic covenant ( see Gen 17:1014 , 2327 ) and legislated in the covenant with Israel ( Lev 12:3 ) , circumcision is found throughout the Bible. 1 Though the theological meaning of circumcision is beyond the scope of this article , it is worth noticing that this covenant was a form of surgery on male genitalia , displaying a distinguishing mark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man . Later , in a section of Leviticus where qualifications for priesthood were described ( Lev 21:20 ) and again when Moses prepared Israel to enter the Promised Land ( Deut 23:1 ) , the Law excluded from the assembly of the LORD anyone who had " crushed testicles " or " whose male organ is cut off . " 2 <p> Circumcision continues to play an important role in the New Testament . While the physical act of removing the foreskin is associated with the old covenant and thus discontinued in the church , its typological fulfillmentthe circumcised heart ( Deut 10:16 ; 30:6 ; cf. Ezek 36:2627 ) is common to all new covenant believers ( Col 2:11 ) . Moving from old covenant to new , the New Testament records many heated discussions about the discontinuity of physical circumcision ( e.g. , Acts 15 ; Romans 2 and 4 ; Galatians 2 ) . Without engaging all these passages , what , if anything , might Scriptures discussion of circumcision contribute to the modern discussion about gender reassignment surgery ? Let me suggest two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , be the " circumcision " of transgenderisms " gospel . " Just as the true gospel includes a circumcisionof the fleshunder the old covenant , which pointed forward to the true circumcision of the heart under the new covenantso the false gospel of transgenderism invites its participants to mutilate their genitalia in order to find a kind of " salvation . " Likewise , just as the true gospel has a mediator who inaugurates a covenant with blood ( 1 Tim 2:5 ; Heb 9:18 ) , so too transgenderisms gospel has created a guild of mediatorsadvocates , entertainers , politicians , and now surgeonswho following the cultural zeitgeist can put to death the old man and raise " her " anew. 3 Moreover , in denying God his rightful place as sovereign over creation , they establish themselves as autonomous lords . By consequence , transgenderism mimicks the true gospel by solving a " fallen condition " that is not revealed by Gods Word , but that comes from an autonomous , personal feeling ( i.e. , men and women trapped in the wrong body ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " salvation " by way of bloodsheda " new creation " through surgical " circumcision . " 4 <p> Of course , sexual rebellion and the distortion of gender roles is nothing new . Lamech boasts of twisting Gods creation when he sings of claiming two wives ( Gen 4:2324 ) , and the Law of Moses lists cross-dressing as a way humans reject the goodness of Gods creation ( Deut 22:5 ) . 5 But now , with advances in medical technology , what used to be feigned through clothes and mannerisms is now surgically possible . There is nothing new under the sun , but what is new is the plethora of medically-acceptable ways to deface Gods creation . <p> Therefore , with many moral , theological , epochal , and physical differences between old covenant Israel and the modern transsexual , the one similarity worth noting is that both " religions " present salvation through the manipulation of the flesh . By doing something to the genitalia , it is perceived that blessings will followin Israel these blessings were the holy promises given to Abraham and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual gratificationhowever that is defined by them. 6 To be clear , there is a radical difference between circumcision under the old covenant and genital mutilation of modern transgenderismthe former was instituted by God ( Genesis 17 ) ; the latter is the invention of men ( cf. Rom 1:32 ) . Likewise , Abrahams circumcision was an act of faith ; gender reassignment surgery is an act of rebellion against God , his created order , and his sovereignty over gender . <p> Nevertheless , when we understand that circumcision of the flesh was always a sign pointing to the need for an interior purification ( Deut 10:16 ; Jer 4:4 ; cf. Acts 7:51 ) and never meant to be salvific in itself , there are also striking similarities . For instance , consider the parallel logic at work in these two systems of salvation . Writing of circumcisions ultimate futility , Paul encourages the Judaizers to go the whole way and " emasculate themselves " ( Gal 5:12 ) . Whereas the Judaizers believed that circumcision brought them closer to God , Paul knew that as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned the Judaizers to go further and emasculate themselves , which under the Law invoked the judgment of Godi.e. , separation from his holy presence . <p> By analogy , Christians believe that despite the sincerest intentions of transsexuals , the surgery they desire to perform on the body needs to be performed on their heart . While these children of Adam long to match their bodies with their inner perception , what they need is not a new body , but a new heart . In this way , the Jews of old and the modern trans community are not without similarities , because both face the same problem : They have exchanged the glory of God for the glory of created things , and therefore God has given them over to a " depraved mind to what ought not to be done " ( Rom 1:23 , 28 ) . <p> To reiterate , this comparison between Old Testament ritual and modern surgery is not materially the same , but when we consider how Jews misused circumcision ( as means of salvation ) and the way transsexuals pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whereas circumcision was ordained by God and pointed to a circumcision of the heart that God himself would perform at the right time , the " circumcision " of transsexuals is the invention of ( technologically advanced ) mankind . Inspired by the father of lies , gender reassignment surgery promises abundant life through the manipulation of the flesh . <p> On this comparison , it reminds us that when we engage family and friends grappling with gender reassignment surgery , we can not fight flesh with flesh " Just learn to live with and love your God-given gender . " No , like Paul and Jesus in the New Testament , we must present a better circumcisionone that strips off the old man and gives disciples new life in Christ ( Col 2:1113 ; 3:13 ) so that learning to live out ones God-given gender is not harsh and heavy , but a yoke that is light and easy ( see Matt 11:2830 ) . Indeed , by understanding gender reassignment surgery as a kind of rite of circumcision , it helps us understand why someone would desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious hope too . By remembering circumcisions place in salvation , it gives us an entry point to speak of a greater gospel , a greater circumcision , and ultimately a greater bodily transformationthe redemption of the body promised to all who are alive in Christ ( Rom 8:23 ) . <p> Second , moving from a big picture analysis of circumcision to a particular text , we return to one verse in Galatians . In Galatians 5:12 Paul expresses with rhetorical force how he wishes Judaizers who were stressing the need for circumcision would " mutilate " or " emasculate " themselves . In the context of Galatians this hyperbole emphasizes the worthlessness of physical circumcision , now that Christ has come. 7 Against the backdrop of the Law , such an action would be both humiliating and disqualifying for temple service ( see Lev 21:20 ; Deut 23:1 ) . Applied to the present discussion , such genital mutilation would invite the curse of God , under the old covenant . Just as sacrifices under the old covenant could not be offered with " testicles bruised or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they did not meet Gods perfect standard , so willful mutilation of the genitals tears at Gods created design. 8 To those who pursue " salvation " by genital surgery , the Law of God offers a warning and threat " if you break the law , your circumcision becomes uncircumcision " ( Rom 2:27 ) . This goes for the Judaizers in Galatia and modern advocates of gender reassignment surgery . <p> To both of these parties ( as well as to those who sinfully take pride in their uncircumcision ) , the gospel of Jesus Christ makes a new way to find life . It offers forgiveness now and a glorified body in the new heavens and the new earth . Yet , as Russell Moore has observed , gender reassignment surgery , in the here and now , may " mangle " the body and " create an illusion of a biological reality that is n't there , " but it can not reassign gender. 9 Therefore , as men and women come to Christ on the other side of their gender reassignment , the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance may not be possible or ( medically ) wise , but what can be done and must be done is to point new creations in Christ to the approaching reality of their bodily redemption , and to live in light of that reality . As Paul says in Colossians 3 , " If you have been raised with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is . . . . Put to death what is earthly in you , . . . Put on , meekness , and patience " ( v. 1 , 5 , 12 ) . 10 <p> Until the resurrection of the body , Christians groan like the eunuchs of old . But like eunuchs in Israel who mourned their displacement from the covenant promises , the gospel of Jesus Christ promises family , children , and blessing in the kingdom of God ( see Isaiah 54 ) . On this point , Moore has again made the comparison between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 As with circumcision , eunuchs are mentioned throughout the Bible . In some instances they were males who were castrated , or had other genital surgery , to serve in special roles within their respective kingdoms . Others may have been born as eunuchs . Jesus speaks to both of these conditions when he of the kingdom of heaven " ( Matt 19:12 ) . Still in everyone of these cases , the main point is that God is big enough to bring blessing to all who repent and believe in the gospel of the kingdomeven those who were deceived into pursuing gender reassignment surgery . <p> That being said , we must close with this unassailable truth . In the Bible , with all that it speaks about circumcision and the existence of eunuchs , it never supports practices changing a childs sex at birth towards the opposite sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as the only way of lasting joy and salvation . In its affirmation of this spiritual surgery , the Bible stands against any kind of gender reassignment surgery , as a way of gratifying the flesh . Therefore , in all cases , we conclude that the Bible never supports the desire to change the appearance of the body to mimic the opposite gender . As with those who pursue sexual immoralityheterosexuals or homosexualsthe hope of the gospel is that any person through faith and repentance can be changed through the washing , sanctification , and justification of Jesus Christ , and not through the adoption , assimilation , or acceptance of sinful roles or practices ( 1 Cor 6:911 ) . <p> Thus , a biblical understanding of sexuality can not support gender reassignment surgery . This truth must be compassionately affirmed to those who are struggling with gender dysphoria , and who are contemplating such surgical procedures . Where the Bible affirms that we should receive our birth gender as a gift from God and that it should direct the nature of our sexual desires , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In every case , anatomy dictates and directs gendernot the reverse . Scripture commands that our physical bodies are meant to glorify God ( 1 Cor 6:19 ) , and followers must humbly and willingly submit to Gods providence in giving us the body he wants us to have , in order to glorify him in the gender that comports to our anatomy . <p> May God honor our efforts to think biblically and critically about the issue of gender reassignment surgery . May he give us gospel-fueled grace to love the trans community in the name of Christ . And may he glorify himself by saving many in Christ who are now pursuing salvation in the flesh . <p> 1For an overview and bibliography of the history and significance of circumcision in the Bible and ancient Near Eastern cultures , see John Meade , " Circumcision of the Heart in Leviticus and Deuteronomy : Divine Means for Resolving Curse and Bringing Blessing , " SBJT 18.3 ( 2014 ) : 5985 . <p> 2Against the overly permissive interpretation of Peter C. Craigie ( The Book of Deuteronomy NICOT ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Merrill ( Deuteronomy NAC ; Nashville : Broadman &amp; Holman , 1994 , 307 ) rightly observes the importance of physical purity in the presence of God : " The emasculation , described here as a wounding by crushing ( p-sva dakkG ) or a cutting off of the male organ ( k-rvt apkG ) , may , presumably , be genetic , accidental , or intentional ; but that is irrelevant because the end result is the samethe male thus deformed could have no access to the assembly of the Lord . " <p> 3Credit to Andrew Walker for this observation , as well as pointing out that just as the Law of Moses called for obedience to external laws , so too transgenderism , as a cultural phenomenon , calls those afflicted by its conditions to obey its " laws , " which are enforced through political and legal pressure applied by approved " mediators . " What is the lasting effect ? Gender reassignment becomes a type of works salvation that in the end neither saves nor works . <p> 4Though unlikely that transsexuals think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the words of Susan Stryker ( " ( De ) Subjugated Knowledges : An Introduction to Transgender Studies , " in The Transgender Studies Reader ed . Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle ; New York : Routledge , 2006 , 3 ) , who says that the social " systems of power " associated with transgenderism " operate on actual bodies i.e. , persons , capable of producing pain and pleasure , health and sickness , punishment and reward , life and death " ( cited in Kessler , " Transgender/Third Gender/Transsexualism , " 2:425 ) . Without realizing it , she is employing the language of redemption . <p> 5As we understand the pagan roots of ancient Near Eastern cross-dressing , it becomes clear the differences between then and now are not a matter of kind but degree . Illustrating that point , Daniel I. Block observes , " this injunction seeks to preserve the order built into creation , specifically the fundamental distinction between male and female . For a person to wear anything associated with the opposite gender confuses ones sexual identity and blurs established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2012 , 512 ) . <p> 8Drawing the parallel closer between the Judaizers heresy and the genital mutilation of the pagan priests near Galatia , George writes , " One of the major centers for the worship of Cybele a mother goddess , whose priests were known to castrate themselves was at Pessinus , a leading city in North Galatia . It is quite possible that some of Pauls readers may themselves have been devotees of the Cybeline cult in their pre-Christian days . In any event , they could not have missed the insinuation of Pauls allusion : the Judaizers who made so much of circumcision were really no better guides to the spiritual life than the pagan priest who castrated themselves in service to an idolatrous religion " ( ibid. , 372 ) . If Paul could compare the wrong use of the Law with pagan practices , which he clearly did in Galatians 4:89 , it is equally permissible ( hermeneutically-speaking ) to make the comparison between the wrongful use of circumcision with the pagan mutilation of the flesh today .

Lead with humility . <p> If I 'm debating with someone online about a political , spiritual , or an otherwise controversial topic , it can be easy for me to argue relentlessly without even the slightest consideration that I may be wrong . <p> What if , no matter how sure we are about how " right " we are , we approach every online discussion with a posture of humility that assumes the other person may be just as right as we are ? I think this would radically improve our tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  use polarizing language . <p> I can not stand shock jocks on TV and radio .

However , you will never hear me call people who are not pro-life " pro-abortion " or " pro-death .

@@100509424 @4709424/ <h> 5 ways the church can help someone facing mental illness <p> Facing mental illness is not an easy process . Regardless of how informed we are , this process is not easy . Trying to walk this difficult journey by yourself only makes it harder . Often , in the arena of mental illness , what the church has to offer are not superior answersif the problem is biological or environmental , the church should provide very similar advice as our secular friends in the mental health field . <p> While the initial guidance the church provides would , in many cases , be the same , the church should always provide a superior context of living out those answersa sphere of relationships where everyone acknowledges we are broken people in need of redemption , thereby , negating the stigma that makes overcoming these struggles so painfully isolating . Counseling is never merely principles and suggestions ; it is also a context that facilitates a journey . <p> That is the ideal ; a stigma-free , redemptive community . But the question remains , " How do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , as Amy Simpson says in her book Troubled Minds , mental illness is often the " no-casserole illness " in Christian circles ; a form of suffering from which the church , uncharacteristically , moves away from suffering people instead of towards them . <p> One of the reasons we move away instead of towards people is confusion and uncertainty about what we should do . When we do n't have good answers , it is often easier to just avoid the people who generate the questions . It is unlikely the church will offer the unique care of a redemptive community if its people are uninformed about and intimidated by mental illness . <p> A particular individual or church does not have to be able to do everything in order to do some very significant things powerfully well . Consider the example of someone in need of knee surgery . There is a surgeon who repairs the ligament ; a physical therapist who helps the individual regain a full range of motion ; family and friends who care for day-to-day needs and provide encouragement ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of roles can exist in the struggle with mental illness . <p> This metaphor is not meant to imply that the church only plays the " friends and family " role . A given church , pastor or friend may be well-equipped to provide various levels of intensive soul care . But it is their responsibility to know the limits of their ability to help and be willing to invite other members on the care team with needed , supplemental expertise . <p> With that in mind , let 's consider many things that the churchas a corporate entity or through its personal relationshipsis uniquely equipped to do . Many of these functions have little-to-no secular alternative ; ongoing gatherings of adults for mutual encouragement and instruction are rare in our culture . <p> The church , corporately or through individuals , can : <p> 1 . Teach a balanced view of mental illness as a part of an ongoing education process . A church has many venues through which this education can occur . Mental health does not need to be the " focal point of the church " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of their interconnected mind , soul , and body . <p> Sermon Illustrations : Speaking of depression , anxiety , trauma , addiction , and other struggles in an informed , unstigmatized way will go a long way toward giving people the emotional freedom to talk about their struggle with friends and seek the help they need . <p> Testimonies : Someone sharing their story has a powerful influence on any groups culture . As someone tells their story of wrestling with mental illness they should ( a ) speak of how personal faith , a community of care , wise care of their body , and counseling played a role in their recovery ; and ( b ) clarify that this is their personal story and not necessarily the map of how God guides every person with a similar struggle in their pursuit of hope and wholeness . <p> Follow Up Blogs : A blog that follows up on a sermon or testimony can be a great way to connect people who still prefer to remain anonymous with helpful resources . The ultimate goal is to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve facilitating many smaller steps in that direction . here 's an example . <p> Adult Education Classes or Conferences : There are a growing number of excellent Christian books on various types of mental illness . These classes or events can simultaneously comfort and equip . Having classes like this communicates that your church is a " safe place " for these conversations and that these topics are a relevant part of living a God-honoring life . <p> Support Groups : While a class or event is educational ( over-viewing a subject ) , a support group is therapeutic ( taking someone on a journey ) . While support groups can create cliques within a church , they can also provide a context for a greater transparency as a next step toward more general authenticity . When starting these groups , a church would want to think through how to prevent a support group from becoming someones long-term community and , thereby , inadvertently reinforcing their struggle as their identity . <p> As you can see in the examples above , a church is a unique context for allowing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where else in our culture could each of these levels of education and connection be provided within a context of ongoing community ? <p> 2 . Befriend those who are struggling with mental illness with multiple people so no one person carries the full weight of responsibility . We often fail to realize that no professional qualifications are required to be a friend . As Amy Simpson in Trouble Minds wrote , " When churches have antibiotic-like expectations for mental health treatment , they communicate , go get treated , then you can come back and you can be a growing Christian with us. " <p> 3 . Have a relationship that includes but transcends the struggle with mental illness . In a purely professional setting , a struggle with mental illness is why an individual is known and cared for . This adds to the stigma and results in a mindset that says I have to be " all better " to be known authentically . With a professional counselor or recovery group if you get better , you " graduate " from having people who know and care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles into categories of sin , suffering , and identity which can be caused by biology , environment , or choice . Emotional unrest and embarrassment make it difficult to sort out how to best categorize struggles . One of the main goals for this presentation is to equip people for these conversations . The more these conversations can be had effectively in natural relationships the earlier people will receive care , the longer they will stick with their care , and less ashamed they will be to embrace the care God wants for them . <p> 5 . Attend a counseling session with your friend , take notes , gain an understanding of their struggle , and serve as an echo of key truths or practices recommended by the counselor . This would require the permission of your friend and the cooperation of the counselor . But many counselors are willing to cooperate with this kind of counseling-advocate model , and it can greatly enhance both the short-term and long-term effectiveness of counseling . <p> This list is not exhaustive . Instead , it is meant to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger in thinking through what the church could do : our personal initiative gets lost in the corporate possibilities . For instance , we think " the church ought to mentor underprivileged students , " but we do n't  take the step of volunteering at the nearest school . <p> As you brainstorm possibilities , I would encourage you not to begin with programs your church could run or staff position that could be filled . Instead , begin with , " What conversations could I have about this material with someone I care about ? " It may be as simple as following up on something they shared with you or seeking their help in sorting through a struggle you 've not talked about . <p> Undoubtedly , mental illness is a difficult subject to address because of its complexity and highly personal nature . Everyone is affected by mental illness ; either personally or someone they love . As a result , it is a subject that must be discussed and addressed in the church . Let 's not let our silence hurt people by leaving them to struggle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Towards a Christian Perspective of Mental Illness , " which available for free in its entirety in both video presentation and PDF article formats . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

@@100509428 @4709428/ <p> By now , you have heard that the Supreme Court issued its long-anticipated decision , which imposed a 50-state same-sex marriage mandate . Pastors and churches have exhibited a great degree of uncertainty preceding the decision , wondering what the impact of the decision will be on their ministry . But now that the decision has been released , we can respond with greater clarity . <p> Here are the immediate things you need to know . <p> The Courts decision <p> The Supreme Court , in a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Kennedy , held that the Equal Protection Clause requires a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a same-sex marriage entered into lawfully in another state . In so holding , the Supreme Court struck down the state constitutional amendments of Michigan , Kentucky , Ohio , and Tennessee that defined marriage as between one man and one woman . The decision redefines marriage for the entire country to include same-sex couples . <p> The majority opinion stated with respect to religious opposition to same-sex marriage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who adhere to religious doctrines , may continue to advocate with utmost , sincere conviction that , by divine precepts , same-sex marriage should not be condoned . The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths , and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered . <p> The Courts statement is welcome to be sure . But the greatest threat for churches lies in the application of the Courts decision to believers who live in jurisdictions covered by so-called " non-discrimination " laws and ordinances . Everywhere that marriage has been redefined in the last several years has seen an awakening of non-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination in employment , housing , or places of public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . These laws are peppered throughout the states and local governments and are a lynchpin of the sexual revolutions broader legal and political strategy : to establish non-discrimination laws at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is not used as an excuse to discriminate . " <p> In the coming days , the threat from these non-discrimination laws will materialize in numerous ways as same-sex couples marry . But there are proactive steps your church can take to protect itself . <p> What should your church do ? <p> 1 . Churches should update their statement of faith on the issues of marriage , human sexuality , and gender <p> Now is the time for churches to maintain a clear witness to the biblical truth about marriage , human sexuality , and gender . Churches should update their statement of faith to include the churchs beliefs on these issues . Doing it in the wake of the Supreme Court decision will not be viewed negatively by a court if a legal issue ever arises . Instead , putting clarifying language in the statement of faith merely serves to codify a churchs long-standing religious beliefs . Alliance Defending Freedom has sample language in ERLC/ADF 's Protecting Your Ministry manual on these issues that provides a starting point . Clarifying the statement of faith can help a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that already , now is the time . <p> 2 . Pastors will not be legally compelled to officiate same-sex wedding ceremoniesfor now <p> In the near term , no pastor will be forced to officiate any wedding ceremony with which he disagrees . Pastors remain free to make a theological determination about who they will marry and who they will not . For example , pastors will normally not marry a believer to an unbeliever and many will not perform ceremonies for someone they know did not have biblical grounds for a previous divorce . Nothing in the Supreme Courts opinion changes the freedom of pastors to continue to make those theologically-based decisions about who they will marry . <p> Consequently , pastors should refrain from retreating from marriage ceremonies . Some have suggested that pastors disengage from " civil marriage " and only perform religious ceremonies . This type of reaction is not only legally unnecessary , but it sends a message that pastors have " abdicated the field " on the battleground of marriage . Instead , pastors should engage more fervently in advocating and expounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to who they will marry and who they will not . <p> 3 . Churches should ensure their facilities usage policies are revised to allow only uses consistent with the Churchs religious beliefs <p> In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling , some churches may be approached by same-sex couples seeking to be married in the church facility . Churches should not feel as if they have to close their doors to the community just to prevent wedding ceremonies with which they disagree . Churches must continue to be a welcoming presence in the community and can do that through updating or revising their facility usage policy . The key point is to tie usage of the churchs facility to the statement of faith and religious beliefs of the church . And then to make clear that uses inconsistent with those religious beliefs will not be allowed . Alliance Defending Freedom has a sample facilities usage policy available in our Protecting Your Ministry manual , available for free download . <p> There are other suggestions for churches contained in ERLC/ADF 's Protecting Your Ministry manual . Now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested guidelines to ensure your ministry is protected . <p> Despite the ruling of the Supreme Court , marriage has not changed . Society may suppress the truth in unrighteousness , but it can not anymore change the truth than it can the color of the sky . The Church has always proclaimed the Gospel to cultures and societies who have rejected truth . Now , more than ever , the Church must fulfill its mission . We may not know in every detail how the marriage decision will impact Americas churches , but we at Alliance Defending Freedom do know that we will continue to work aggressively to keep the legal door open for the spread of the Gospel .

As tears streamed from my eyes , little did I know the Lord would bring my dad back to Seattle so soon . While I was shocked on that day , July 18 , 2012 , to get a call from my brother informing me of my father 's dementia , I was at peace as I spoke to my father on the phone for the first time in six and a half years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know who this is ? " " Yes , I do , " dad said , " its my son David . " <p> Whenever I share this story of my father 's dementia , I usually I get the response , " I 'm so sorry to hear that and I will pray for you . " My family and I greatly appreciate this . Often , people want to their experience of a family member or friend going through a mental illness . I also appreciate these responses since they encourage and help me . In this article , I want to share how I handle caring for a parent with dementia . I 'd like to make it clear upfront that I 'm not an expert in dementia care . I 'm a theologian , not a psychologist . It is my prayer that as I share thoughts based on my experience , God might use my situation to help you through your own time of need . <p> Over the past two years I 've learned the best way to deal with a parent with dementia is to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:8 , " Think on what is noble and pure . " Honestly , thinking on what is noble and pure is hard in light of the devastating effects of such a debilitating disease as dementia . Thinking about what dementia will do to my dad causes me to tear up . Perhaps your family member has cancer or another devastating disease . Thankfully , there is coming a day when , the Bible declares , Jesus will wipe away every tear from every eye . I encourage you to feel however you need to feel in the meantime . <p> Scripture teaches that Jesus is fully God and fully man . As a man , Jesus experienced the full range of emotions and yet never sinned . He was tempted in every way but did not sin . I do n't  know about you , but this is what causes me to worship Jesus all the more . When I struggle with my dads dementia , I reflect on who Jesus is and His character , which changes my perspective . Rather than being down and glum , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive , that I can speak to him . <p> With that said , I would like to share a few things to hopefully help you deal with and care for a parent with dementia . <p> First , have a regular time in Gods Word , prayer and private worship . <p> Second , find a solid Bible-believing church and enroll in a small group . My small group regularly prays for my dad and asks how I 'm doing . This is important . Letting people get close to you can be scary , but as Christians we are called to love one another . The group knows me well enough to know when I 'm struggling . <p> Third , find godly friends who will encourage you . It is essential to find Christians not engaged with your local church . If you blog , connect with people through comments and emails . Get to know other bloggers . I always enjoy getting to know my readers and hearing what the Lord is doing in and through their lives . <p> All these things keep my focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a posture of servitude toward God and those he places in my life . <p> I do n't  know where you are in your own journey with Christ , or whether you or a family member suffer from dementia or another serious illness . This might sound weird , but I 'm thankful for my dads dementia . <p> The Lord has used my dads dementia to soften my heart towards himself , humble me and grow me in Gods grace . While experiencing the fires of affliction , we most clearly see the beauty , wonder and glory of the cross of Christ . We have a suffering Savior who knows and understands our every feeling and experience . <p> He invites us to boldly come before his throne of grace ( Heb. 4:16 ) , which is what I encourage you to do .

@@100509437 @4709437/ <h> 5 suggestions for raising non-narcissistic children <p> A recent study on the origins of narcissism in children concluded , " narcissism in children is cultivated by parental overvaluation : parents believing their child to be more special and more entitled than others . " The abstract of the study further explains , " children seem to acquire narcissism , in part , by internalizing parents inflated views of them . " Unfortunately , the " you are so special , so smart , so beautiful , so talented , so giftedyou can do anything you want to do and be anything you want to bemantra " is often believed , and our children suffer because of it . <p> Counterproductive praise <p> The study dovetails with New York Times bestseller Nurture Shock : New Thinking About Children by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman . Their research concluded that heaping praise on children detached from achievement in an effort to boost their self-esteem is counterproductive . They assert that the result of this " self-esteem above all else " approach to parenting has produced a generation of American young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear challenges . <p> Every Christian parent ought to know there are grave implications for nurturing children in this type of self-oriented flattery culture . Yet , Christian parents who possess a nice-centric worldview are often the worst offenders . Above all people , Christian parents who understand the gospel of Christ should know that a smiley-faced sentimental approach to child rearing is an impotent placebo for preparing their children for the spiritual war that is life . Over-praising children detached from achievement encourages them to live based on an image and makes them fearful they might be exposed as not being so special , smart , talented , beautiful and gifted . Such parenting makes children inordinately self-conscious and frequently discontent . <p> Purposeful parenting <p> Above all else , a Christian parents job is to create categories in their childrens daily lives that help make the gospel intelligible as they prepare them for adulthood . Foundational to a Christian worldview is the truth : " God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble " ( James 4:6 , 1 Pet . 5:5 ) . Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake , but for their childs sake . Teaching your children to live under appropriate authority is a gift that leads to contentment . A gospel-centered approach to parenting that cultivates a biblical worldview will not abandon honest conversation about the childs strengths ( appropriate praise is vital ) and weaknesses . <p> Children are created in the image of God with a responsibility to honor and obey Godand parents . Christian parents must love God and their children enough to demand obedience and honor from their children ( Exod. 20:12 , Eph. 6:1-3 ) . No child is helped by a parent who cultivates Gnostic-style categories of assessment that sever the childs actual behavior from who they are . For instance , the parent who thinks the proper response to a childs act of rebellion is to try to raise their self-esteem ( you are such a good person ) has lost touch with biblical reality . Some parents go so far as to give positive names to rebellious acts . I knew a parent whose child got out of bed during naptime , opened the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out what he had done she exclaimed , " He is so creative ! " which was not the descriptor that came to my mind . <p> Below are some simple suggestions on how to raise non-narcissistic children who have been taught the value of humility , submission and hard work . I do not offer these suggestions as though they carry " Thus saith the Lord " authority but as sanctified Christian common sense . <p> Tell your children the truth . No really , tell them the truth . Do not tell them the empty delusional clichTs like , " If you believe it , you can achieve it . " If they are not very good at something say , " You are not very good at . so here is how you can work hard to get better , and if you do n't  get better , here is how you can serve others or help your team . " After all , most people are not the best at anything , but they can strive to be their best at what they do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot like Pauls description of life in the church ( 1 Cor 12 ) . <p> Say " no " often and mean it . Saying " no " is a gift ; maturity can not take place without it , and it also makes it meaningful when you say " yes . " A parent who rarely says " no " to his or her children or only does so apologetically is cultivating an entitlement mentality and setting them up for failure as adults . Winston Churchill famously and insightfully said , " Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm . " Humbly hearing " no " from someone in authority and resourcefully pressing ahead with eagerness is a foundational life skill . Such ought to be obvious to a people who say , " Jesus is Lord . " <p> If they play sports , always support the coaches decisions about playing time . When the familiar family drama of playing time in the childs athletics arises , it is easy to react with all priority given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the kid who is starting in front of him or her . But , so what ? The real question is how he or she responds to the situation . What good will it do to tell your child they should be playing more and to talk to the coach about them getting more playing time ? Tell them , " Most coaches want to win , and if they thought you gave them the best opportunity to win , they would be playing you . If you want to play , then work harder and make it clear to the coach that you are the best option , and do not sit around and whine about it . " What a great opportunity to learn to be an adult employee to the glory of God . <p> Teach them their teacher is always right ( even if they are wrong ) . Teach your children that it is not the job of the teacher to adjust to them ; it is their job to adjust to the teacher . The teacher is the authority in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher does something immoral or unethical ( and you need to have those discussions with your children as well ) , then their authority should be honored in the classroom . The teacher may make arbitrary decisions in the classroom , and they may unfairly grade an assignmentI call that great life preparation . Children who grow up as fairness policemen of others rather than focusing on their own effort are generally unproductive in culture and the church . <p> Require that they use honorific titles . Doing so cultivates a basic respect for authority and a willingness to recognize hierarchal structures and roles that God has wisely ordained . Demanding your children use Mister , Miss(es) , Doctor , Officer , President , Governor and so forth is a consistent theology lesson . Few things are more detrimental to shaping a biblical worldview than a child walking up to an older man and saying , " Hey , Bob . " Or , as is often the case in my conservative evangelical circles , children who call the president " Obama " with a sneer , and parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents , do we really want to teach our children that they do not have to show respect for those in authority because they disagree ? What about when they disagree with you ? <p> I could offer countless other suggestions , but I hope these five will provide a helpful trajectory . If Christian parents desire their children to say , " Jesus is Lord " ( 1 Cor. 12:3 ) , take up their cross and follow him ( Luke 9:23 ) , and to count others more important than themselves ( Phil . 2:3 ) , then the empty , self-referential , flattery model of parenting must be abandoned in favor of a cruciform worldview. 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176 
@@100509438 @4709438/ <h> How to give social exegesis a try <p> These days , there seems to be an unending drama between some white police officers and some members of the black community . With the abundance of cell phone cameras and now body cameras on some police officers , Americans will continue to see a proliferation of controversial and sometimes hard-to-watch videos thrust upon us with regularity . Naturally , we are all left with the task of interpreting what we 're watching even though the story is still unfolding . <p> Depending upon our lens on life , many of us will jump to conclusions and make judgement calls based on what we initially see . Some of us will defend the police , whereas others of us will defend the ones being policed . And yet , when the smoke clears , we 'll be left further divided as a nation . <p> How can we better interpret these tragic episodes ? How can we remain passionate while becoming more objective , regardless of what door we may enter into the discussion ( or debate ) through ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can we find common-unity in these perplexing social ills that dominate the media and often fuel our fears ? <p> In perilous times like these , I recommend what I call social exegesis . <p> Social exegesis is the ability to see objectively and interpret soundly the complex pieces of society that create the whole . Rather than doing social eisegesis , which is the misstep of reading into a situation our personal beliefs , biases , and agendas , we must try our best , with the help of God , to do social exegesis . As with biblical exegesis , it is incumbent upon the interpreter to let the context speak for itself . <p> Here are four principles to use for the next social disturbance we 'll encounter on the pages of life : <p> 1 . Ask questions <p> Through initial observation , ask yourself : What happened ? What is it that I see plainly ? What is it that I do n't see so plainly ? What is the immediate context of this occurrence ? What is the surrounding context ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources am I relying on to give me my information ? What are the counter views ? Is there any validity to those perspectives ? Like the Ethiopian Eunuch needed help from Philip to interpret the Bible ( Acts 8:26-40 ) , who can help me from the black community and the police community with my initial questions ? <p> 2 . Dig deeper <p> What are the invisible yet very real factors that had bearings on this matter ? Go below the surface of this potentially divisive event and run it through the grid of each of these seven tenants : <p> Historical- What is the overall history of the town ? What is the immediate history between cops and civilians ? What is this town or vicinity known for ? How does this episode align with America 's proven history of discrimination towards minorities ? <p> Racial- How do we deal with the race issue without making race the issue ? Statistically , what people groups dominate places of power and what people groups have been targeted and impacted the most by community policing ? If race is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what instance would you point to where race was a factor ? What makes these two situations different ? To either deny race or blame everything on race is irresponsible . <p> Economical- What is the local economy like ? What role does wealth and poverty play in this episode ? How are the disenfranchised looked upon ? Are the neighborhoods overwhelmingly divided by race and class ? Do you feel most people are poor solely because they are lazy or made bad choices ? What role does systemic inequality play in your understanding of poverty ? <p> Educational- Is there a disparity of quality between the local schools and their respective districts ? If so , why is that ? Would you send your children to " that " school ? If not , why ? <p> Judicial- Are just people in office who care about the whole of the community and not just certain segments ? How would you know this ? Have there been any recently recorded instances of racial profiling , police brutality , or misuse of authority by governing officials ? What are the arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's representation of power disbursed between people groups ? <p> Cultural- What factors make some police appear combative ? What factors make some citizens resist the police and not trust them ? Who determines which idioms , expressions , and activities are right and wrong ? What underlying factors help influence behavior ? <p> Spiritual- What is the spiritual temperature of the community ? Do religious people have a private faith or one that manifests in the public sector ? How does politics influence which social ills are deemed appropriate for the religious community to confront ? Is the religious community divided by race and class ? If so , why ? How is Satan at work ? <p> As social observers , we must get below the surface of the iceberg in order to see the biggest and often unseen parts of the problem . <p> 3 . Be honest <p> We all have biases because we all have imperfections . If we 're honest , we 'll admit them . None of us are perfectly objective and due to our experiences and relationships we bring partiality to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , are you aware of your implicit biases towards Whites , Blacks , and Browns ? What about your prejudices towards the elderly , young people , men , women , police , politicians and the media ? What human , social , and cultural limitations do you admit to having in regards to interpreting this event in a fair manner ? What is it that you do n't know ? How have you committed social eisegesis by reading into the altercation things that are n't there based on an agenda ? Sometimes our agenda is that we have to always be right even when we 're wrong . It 's called pride and we all have it . <p> 4 . Do something <p> Now that we have more knowledge , what should we do with it ? Awareness should lead us to action . In the Bible , the tribe of Issachar understood the times and knew what Israel should do ( I Chronicles 12:32 ) . Besides praying , how can you be a force for good ? What can you do in your community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ways can you be a change agent ? A bridge builder ? A peace maker ? A reconciler ? A restorer of the breach ? How can you use your platform and sphere of influence to encourage healing , hope , accountability , and unity ? What can you say to your people that they may take heed to simply because you said it ? How can you change unjust systems and not just blinded minds ? What can you say or promote on social media that is educational , inclusive , and compassionate ? How can you put water on this fire and not gasoline ? How can you use this as a teachable moment with your children ? <p> Why not give these four steps of social exegesis a try ? It 's very likely that tomorrow will produce another tragedy . We ca n't change what will happen , but we can change how we interpret it . 43169 @qwx903169 43177 @qwx903177 43180 @qwx903180 43186 @qwx903186

The theme is " You Are Not Alone , " which is appropriate given the fact that one in eight couples experiences this painful phenomenon . Resolve is the National Infertility Association , which has been holding the annual awareness week since 1989 . <p> Infertility is my experience , too . <p> So , why have I not heard of this awareness week until just this year ? Perhaps it is because I have a growing sensitivity to infertility due to opening up publicly about my own journey . I began sharing about it on my blog around January 2014 . A few short months later , on Mothers Day , my husband and I announced that we were planning to adopt . The very next week , we found out that we could not naturally conceive . <p> I love how God placed the desire for us to adopt on our hearts long before we knew we could not conceive . Sure , we had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had children almost a dozen years into marriage . But , we were not compelled to really explore the infertility or treatment for it . <p> This is just our story , though . You see , everyone who has experienced infertility has a different story . Some couples grieve significantly over not being able to conceive naturally or have biological children . Some couples decide to go forward with infertility treatment . Some couples decide to adopt , while others do not feel called to that . <p> Your support matters . <p> There are so many ways you can support people who experience infertility . If you think you do n't  know anyone who has or is experiencing this , you are mistaken . Not every couple chooses to share their story . Trust me , it is very difficult . As a woman , it is easy to feel something is " wrong " with me ( other than the physical issues that have led to the infertility ) . We hear that children are a blessing from God and may be tempted to question what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , this kind of thinking is often unhealthy , irrational and unbiblical . <p> We may never know why some couples who long for a child are not able to conceive , but we do know that God is still good . He is still faithful . He can still bless us and use us to bless others . Infertility can be a thorn in the flesh , but we know that suffering leads to hope , and hope never disappoints ( Rom. 5:3-5 ) . <p> So , what do you need to know in order to support your friends who are dealing with infertility ? Here are a few tips : <p> We are all different . Our reactions are all different . Some couples who experience infertility are emotionally affected when a friend announces a pregnancy or when attending a baby shower . Some do n't  enjoy attending childrens birthday parties or working in the church nursery . I personally rejoice over all of this , but we are all different . Be sensitive to your friends who are walking down this difficult path . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attending your baby shower or childs birthday party . ( And , I also encourage those who are experiencing infertility to try and find the joy in those precious moments , and to rejoice with those who rejoice ! ) <p> Be cautious with your questions . I have been asked all sorts of questions . Examples include : Are you going to have children ? ; When are you going to have children ? Have you considered adoption ? Are you trying to have children ? Are you doing anything to prevent pregnancy ? What about IVF ? I am sure some of these questions stem from curiosity , while others are pretty personal . It is always surprising to me when someone asks questions that are actually related to my intimate life . To be quite frank , none of this is any of your business . It is likely that if you are close enough with someone , they will share some of this with you . But , please be cautious with your questions , and allow your friends to share with you what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  make assumptions . You may think you know someones story and why they do n't  have any children . The fact is , you may not know the whole story . I have had a number of friends who experienced secondary infertilitysince they already had one child , people would frequently question when they were planning have more children , not knowing that they had either experienced miscarriages or that they were unable to conceive again . I have also found this to be the case with friends who have had more than one child . Infertility is not just experienced by childless couples . <p> God has a different plan for every couple . During this years National Infertility Awareness Week , please help raise awareness . Recognize that we are all different , be cautious with your questions , and do n't  make assumptions . Instead , show Gods love , pray for your friends , and simply be there to support them . 43169 @qwx903169 43179 @qwx903179 43175 @qwx903175 
@@100509441 @4709441/ <h> 3 ways to minister to stepmoms on Mother 's Day and beyond <p> For many women , Mothers Day is a happy timea time to be recognized and praised by husbands and a day when " her children rise and called her blessed . " Its a day of reflection and gratitude for the woman who basks in the gift of motherhood . <p> Yet , for other women , Mothers Day is painful . Its a day that serves as a reminder of what never was or never will be . Most of these women walk through the valley of infertility or have suffered at the hands of miscarriage . <p> For others that fall into this category , this day is painful because they have n't had the chance to become a mothersimply because they would like to have married years ago , and there is no suitor in sight . <p> Thankfully , the church is having conversations that breed sensitivity toward the women who fall into these categories . And that is great news . <p> But there is another group of women who find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least , awkward . They are a relatively silent , yet growing number of women . <p> They are stepmothers . <p> My friend and stepfamily expert Laura Petherbridge explains this quite plainly : " Mothers Day can be such a painful day for a stepmother , because she has all of the hard work associated with the mother rolehelping with homework , cooking , carpooling , financial strainbut does n't  have the perks , like love , loyalty and devotion that come along with being a biological mom . " <p> In my seven-year experience as a stepmom , Mothers Day is n't as much painful as it is awkward . For example , when someone wishes me a happy Mothers Day , I am torn between offering a simple " thank you " and going into a full blown explanation of my situation . <p> After all , there is nothing simple about being a stepmom . <p> The Mothers Day church service can get particularly awkward for those of us stepmoms who do not have any children of our own . On that particular morning , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moments like this put us in a quandary : If we stand , we feel like frauds because we are not real moms . If we stay seated , we feel guilty because it may send the message to our husbandsand to others in the congregationthat we do n't  want to claim our stepchildren . <p> I am thankful to have positives in my situation that are not present in other stepfamilies . I have a good relationship with my teenaged stepsons . And their mother and I do n't  just get along ; we have developed a friendship over the years . I am grateful for such blessings . <p> However , stepfamily lifeeven mineis still complicated . Here are some ways the church can minister to stepmoms ( and stepfamilies , in general ) on Mothers Dayand beyond . <p> 1 . Acknowledge our roles <p> This can vary from church to church , but I have found that there are people who are afraid of saying " stepmom " or " stepdad . " They just do n't  know what to do with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people die . Do n't  be afraid to use honest language , as long as it does n't  tear down or destroy . <p> Also , please understand that you may get a complicated answer when you ask , " How many kids do you have ? " When I get that question , my answer is , " I have two stepsons . " Most stepmoms do n't  have an answer that tidy , as many of them brought children of their own into the marriage . And some of those have had additional children with their current spouse . <p> In acknowledging their role , there must be understanding as you learn about the stepfamilies in your church . There are no simple answers , becauseagainthere is nothing simple about stepfamily dynamics . <p> 2 . Sympathize with our struggles <p> As you grow to understand the stepfamilies in your church , you can minister to them by sympathizing with their struggles . <p> Stepfamilies have unique challenges . One example of this is holidays . Holidays are often the most stressful times in the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially difficult because they are without their children , depending on the sharing arrangements . And if the blended family couple does not have other family in their lives , or nearby , these times can prove especially lonely . <p> By getting to know the stepfamilies in your church , you have a window into struggles like this one . And in doing so , the opportunity to minister presents itself . Perhaps there is a lonely blended family couple in your church without their kids at the holidays that could benefit from an invitation to your home this Thanksgiving or Christmas . <p> 3 . Include us , do n't  single us out <p> Those of us who are in Christ , and who are also stepparents , possess spiritual gifts just like married couples in a traditional family . <p> The tendency is to segregate according to life stage . When it comes to church life , I have observed that stepparents get similar treatment as singles .

@@100509442 @4709442/ <h> All we need to know about religious mockery , we learned in Rome <p> Has any subject been depicted in art more than Jesus Christ ? Da Vinci painted the Last Supper . Michaelangelo sculpted the lifeless body of Jesus in the arms of Mary in his Pieta . How many great masters painted the Madonna and Child ? How many crucifixes adorn the bodices of Roman Catholics ? Images of Jesus are ubiquitous . <p> The earliest surviving depiction of Jesus , however , is probably unlike anything you 'll find in your local art gallery or religious bookstore . It was n't an oil painting or a sculpture in marble ; it was a bit of graffiti , hastily scratched into plaster . It was a cartoon . It featured a man , Alexamenos , worshipping a man who was hanging from a cross and who had the head of a jackass . The graffiti contains an inscription : " Alexamenos worships his god . " <p> 3 lessons from the Roman era <p> It was back in Rome , in the Kindergarten of Christianity , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockery . The lessons from that era remain valid today . Indeed , even as heroic members of my congregation have donned a uniform and have faced gunfire from Islamic terrorists in Garlandeven in this modern age of global war , those ancient lessons from Rome represent all that we really need to know . <p> 1 . In Rome we learned that the followers of Jesus do not answer with lethal weapons the sort of mockery that the Alexamenos graffito represents . There was no Christian guerilla brigade . Our Lord is the King of angels ; he does not need assault teams to defend his honor . Just as people sometimes need to be reminded about the simple lessons that they learned in Kindergarten , Christians have not always remembered this simple , nonviolent approach that served us so well in our earlier days . The episodes when we have forgotten have been the darkest , weakest chapters in our story . <p> In this era , the contrast serves the gospel wellours is the faith in which God sends his Son to die for us , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die for him . <p> 2 . In Rome we also learned that the followers of Jesus are not the cartoonists of the world . The great apologists answered the criticisms of our opponents , but they did so by making serious responses to important questions , not by trying to mock and provoke the followers of other faiths . We do not sit in the seat of the scoffers . We do not venerate Mohammed . We do not agree with what the Quran says about Mohammed . Neither do we lampoon Mohammed . We do not participate in Pamela Gellers anti-Islamic tirades and cartoons of Mohammed . <p> Actually , we talk about Mohammed as little as we can , because it is n't about Mohammed ; its about Jesus . We have no need to tear down Mohammed , because our mission is to lift up Jesus so that the world might be drawn to him . Efforts to offend Muslims by depicting Mohammed in cartoons are entirely beside the point , and Christians who participate in such activities have fallen victim to a distraction from their mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that Jesus wins in a fair fight . No . Wait . That 's not quite it , is it ? Jesus wins in unfair fights , too . In fact , no matter how much people stack the deck against Jesus , all fights are unfair in Jesus favor . That 's why we Baptists have tirelessly advocated for religious liberty and free speech as the rightful possession of all people from all faiths , including those who believe that they have no belief at all . When people attempt to stifle free speech and free religious exercise , they betray their fear of the power of faith and of their own comparative weakness . <p> But we , the servants of the Lord of hosts , have nothing to fear from the cartoons and jeers of detractors , or even from the sophistries of false religions most noble and eloquent advocates . We say let the cartoonists draw their cartoons , let the jihadis draw their weapons , and in the end , let every knee , nonetheless , bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord . 43169 @qwx903169 43177 @qwx903177 43180 @qwx903180 43186 @qwx903186

Concerned the server will misunderstand him , he says " Wait , Im worried what you just heard was , Give me a lot of bacon and eggs. What I said was , give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Do you understand ? " <p> Ron Swansons concern that his order would be misunderstood reminds me of a similar concern I have about evangelical approaches to Israels conquest of Canaan . There 's a danger that we reinterpret Gods call to Israel to " completely destroy " the Canaanites in Deuteronomy 13 and 20 as hyperbole for simply defeating their enemies . <p> In his order at the diner , Ron Swanson wanted to be clear that he demanded all the bacon and eggs . In his call for Israel to war against the Canaanites , God wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . If anyone had a heartbeat , whether soldier or man or woman or child or livestock , it had to be stopped . <p> Why is it that evangelicals often seem to misunderstand Gods command to " show no mercy " to the Canaanites as simply an instruction to " kill a lot of bad guys ? " Could it be that the reason we often sanitize the violence of the Old Testament is because we do n't  understand why it is necessary to the biblical storyline ? <p> When we understand the four reasons God commands violence in the Old Testament , it frees us to rightly understand Israels conquest of Canaan . <p> 1 . The violence of the Old Testament preserves the messianic bloodline . The seed of the woman ; the offspring of Abraham ; the prophet like Moses ; the greater Joshua ; the son of David : in all these ways , God promises to maintain a lineage that would bring forth a messiah . The violent scenes of the Old Testament show us the way that God preserves the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , if the enemies of God ultimately defeat the people of God , then the promise of God will fail . If God does n't  protect his people from their enemies , then the line of Jesus is cut off , and there is no salvation . If not for the violence of the Old Testament , then , you and I are headed toward hell right now . <p> 2 . The violence of the Old Testament purifies the people of God . A primary reason that God calls his people to defeat his enemies is so that the surrounding nations do not lead Israel astray through idolatry and sin . God knows that his people will join others in sin if they do not beat them first . <p> This call to purity is precisely why we see a pattern emerge in the violence of the Old Testament . While God fights for his people in their faithful obedience , he fights against his unfaithful people in their sinful rebellion . Victory for the pure ; defeat for the impure . Exodus for the faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect life of Christ that a new Israel comes as the only faithful One of God and achieves the ultimate crown of victory . <p> 3 . The violence of the Old Testament prophesies the judgment of God . As Gods people conquer Gods enemies in victory , it declares to the surrounding nations that Yahweh is the rightful ruler of the universe . And when Gods enemies conquer Gods people in defeat , it declares to Israel that rebellion , even by Gods people , is worthy of judgment . <p> The violence of the Old Testament signals a real-time foretaste of an end times reality for everyone : those who reject the King will receive his wrath . The Old Testament enemies of God received the military judgment of God in conquest . All those who are outside of Christ will receive the spiritual judgment of God in hell . <p> 4 . The violence of the Old Testament patterns the atonement of Christ . In the cross and resurrection , we see the convergence of the Old Testaments holy war pattern . Jesus is the conquering messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience . But Jesus is also the substitutionary wrath-bearer who God fights against in judgment because he takes on our sinful rebellion . <p> At salvation , we are united to Christ so that he grants us the victory we do n't  deserve and bears the penalty we owe . Covered by the righteousness of his shed blood , God sees Christians as his faithful people who he enables to find lasting victory in spiritual warfare by the power of the Spirit . <p> Ron Swanson had a reason to be concerned the server at the diner would misunderstand his order for all the bacon and eggs : it seems unnecessary and even outrageous that anyone would demand that much food . There 's the same risk that we will misunderstand the violence of the Old Testament : it seems unnecessary and even outrageous that God would demand that much conquest . <p> But if we understand the violence of the Old Testament in light of the unfolding kingdom central to the biblical narrative , it will allow us to recognize how this bloodshed preserves Gods messiah , purifies Gods people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope we all desperately long for . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> Over the weekend , a tweet from CNN promoted a new series called " Believer " with Reza Aslan that begins airing on Sunday , March 5 .

In the most recent release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the name and criteria for diagnosis of autism was changed .

Parents of children with ASD are used to advocating for their children . They are used to standing up for them and getting their needs met within the educational system . Ask them to teach you about ASD and what their child needs . Include them on decision making in developing programs , services and classes to meet those needs . <p> Care for their children : The service and care that a church can offer depends greatly on its size and resources .

They are always on guard and always alert to their childrens needs . They are constantly advocating for their children . They are weary and worn and it impacts other areas of their life . Consider ways you can provide respite for these families so that the parents can go out on dates or go to needed appointments for their own needs or simply get needed rest . <p> Consider it a ministry to your community : With the number of families impacted by ASD , it is a huge need in our communities .

American evangelicals are , sometimes frantically , trying to adjust to an increasingly post-Christian America . We can no longer pretend that we are a " moral majority , " sharing " values " with the American mainstream . In a quest to differentiate themselves from the activism of previous generations , some younger evangelicals wish to retreat into a libertarian cultural isolationism , and some wish to adjust to the ambient culture . <p> Those who wish to retreat are wrong . Pulling back from politics or cultural engagement is the wrong approach . What we need is actually a kingdom-focused revitalizing of politics . Many have rightly grown cynical of movements that are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right political boxes . They are disenchanted with movements that seem more content to vaporize opponents with sound-bytes rather than to engage in a long-term strategy of providing a theology of gospel-focused action in the public square . <p> But we must engage the culture . The question is why and how . We engage politically because we love our neighbors ; we care about human flourishing . And we do so on multiple fronts . We engage on Capitol Hill on issues ranging from stopping the abortion industry , to protecting religious liberty , to speaking out for human rights for the persecuted overseas . We also cultivate churches that see the holistic nature of the kingdom of God and who shape the consciences of people to live as citizens . But we always do that with the mindset that we are ultimately seeking to point people to the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world . <p> That means that we speak and we vote and we mobilize , but we do n't  do so as gloomy pessimists , continually wringing our hands or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanve utopians , believing we can organize our way back to a golden era . We do it as those who weep for those around us who are being sifted by the darkness . We do it as those who are cheerily marching to Zion , knowing that whatever the short-term setbacks , we are on the winning side of history . <p> We recognize that our vote for President of the United States is crucially important and we will be held accountable at Judgment for whomever we hand the Romans 13 sword to . But we know that our vote on the membership of our churches is even more important . A church that loses the gospel is a losing church , no matter how many political victories it wins . A church that is right on public convictions but wrong on the gospel is a powerless church , no matter how powerful it seems . <p> That means modeling a Christian political engagement that does n't  start or end with politics alone .

Her audience , mostly women in their 80s and 90s , grinned as she navigated all the parked walkers , canes and wheelchairs as if it were a playground . <p> Couples will often do the math for how old theyll be when their children hit certain milestones ; how old theyll be when their kids graduate from high-school , for example .

" Its not just free babysitting that 's on the line , however . Ailing grandparents who are too feeble to play with their grandchildren , or too beset with dementia to recognize them , is a tragic loss physically . But what about the spiritual cost ? How many little ones will never hear grandpa and grandma tell the stories of Gods faithfulness over the course of their long lives ? <p> In our culture , most young couples need more than a subtle nudge from a magazine article to start having babies .

They wanted to know why we were werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes you think you 'll be fertile when you 're finally ready ? " she asked .

He knew his ailing heart would likely cut his life short , and he did n't  have the luxury of waiting a long time to meet the next generation . He lived with an awareness of his mortality that those who are healthy pretend away . And so he spoke up . <p> His declining health gave him an urgency uncommon among other parents his age . If he were to meet his grandchildren , theyd have to be born soon . His prophetic bent proved true : He died at age 56 of congestive heart failure .

But many also believe it 's not their place to advocate for them early in their children 's ' marriages beyond an occasional joke or subtle jibe . I 'm glad Steves Dad was n't one of them .

@@100509450 @4709450/ <h> Its time for Christians to tell the truth about abortion politics <p> This week the pro-life movement was handed a once-in-a-decade moment to change the debate on politics of abortion . Will Christians have the courage to take advantage of this opportunity ? <p> Here is a breakdown of what happened . <p> Sen. Rand Paul announced his bid for the presidency on Tuesday , and by the next day reporters were already pressing him to defend his position on abortion . An Associated Press reporter asked Paul whether he would allow some exemptions in abortion policies . The senator answered , <p> The thing is about abortionand about a lot of thingsis that I think people get tied up in all these details of , sort of , you 're this or this or that , or you 're hard and fast ( on ) one thing or the other . I 've supported both bills with and without ( exceptions ) , you know . In general , I am pro-life . So I will support legislation that advances and shows that life is special and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) pushed that interview out to reporters at 1 p.m . Within minutes Paul was asked by another reporter to respond to the DNCs email and clarify where he stood on exemptions : <p> What 's the DNC say ? We always seen to have the debate wayyyyyy over here on what are the exact details of exceptions , or when it starts . Why do n't  we ask the DNC : Is it okay to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus ? You go back and you ask FL congresswoman and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she 's OK with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet . Ask her when life begins , and you ask Debbie when she 's willing to protect life . When you get an answer from Debbie , come back to me . <p> here 's an answer I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved . Period . End of story . Now your turn , Senator Paul . We know you want to allow government officials like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by your opposition to any exceptions , even when it comes to rape , incest , or life of the mother ? Or do we just have different definitions of personal liberty ? And I 'd appreciate it if you could respond without shushing me . <p> Sounds like her answer is yes , that she 's okay with killing a seven-pound baby . . . But Debbie 's position , which I guess is the Democrat Party 's position , that an abortion all the way up until the day of birth would be fine , I think most pro-choice people would be really uncomfortable with that . So I do n't know -- I really think she 's got some explaining to do . <p> The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman 's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy , including a safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay . We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right . Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman , her family , her doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians or government to get in the way . <p> That statement is carefully worded for maximum obfuscation . Knowlegeable abortion supporters know it means opposing any restrictions on abortion from the moment of conception until the baby has left the birth canal . <p> Many " pro-choice " advocates support Roe because they believe it puts restrictions on third-trimester abortions . It does not . Contrary to the popular perception , Roe does not limit abortion to the first trimester but institutionalized abortion on demand in all 50 states throughout all phases of a pregnancy . As the Supreme Court wrote in the 1992 case Casey v. Planned Parenthood , " we reject the trimester framework , which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of Roe . " <p> Because Roe protects partial-birth abortion , the Democratic Party platform endorses at least some forms of infanticide ( the question of where to draw the line on killing viable babies , inside or outside the womb , is left unclear ) . <p> The platform statement also refers to " doctors " helping the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved . " When most people hear the word " doctor " they think of a primary-care physician . But in this context it is referring to an abortionist . <p> The Doe v. Bolton case , decided on the same day as Roe , states that a woman may obtain an abortion after viability , if necessary to " protect her health . That determination about health is made by the " attending physician , " which , as Ramesh Ponnuru has explained , <p> The ' attending physician ' in real life , very often an abortionist with a financial stake in the decisioncan always say that in his medical judgment , the abortion was necessary to preserve the woman 's emotional ' health , ' especially considered in light of her ' familial ' situation . Any prosecution would have to be abandoned as unconstitutional . In other words : The Supreme Court has effectively forbidden any state from prohibiting abortion even in the final stages of abortion . <p> This radical support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream of Americans views on the issue . Almost two-thirds of Americans ( 71 percent ) support some restrictions , especially on late-term abortions ( 80 percent believe that abortion should be illegal in the last three months of pregnancy ) . <p> If more people were aware of where the Democratic Party stood on the issue , it might force them to moderate their position . But they are able to maintain their radical view in large part because many Christians , including pastors and religious leaders , refuse to speak freely . <p> Too many Christians refuse to directly criticize the Democratic Partys position on abortion because of a fear of being considered " partisan . " The assumption is that any direct pushback of the Democrats abortion policy is considered a tacit endorsement of the GOP . This is not just wrong , it is dangerous . While we may align with a political group , Christians should not be beholden to any party . We should hold all political parties accountable when they are espousing unbiblical and anti-human ideas . If this gets us called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay . The American church has a serious problem if we are more worried about being mislabeled as " partisan " than we are in protecting innocent human life . <p> By refusing to speak up we are not only failing the weak and vulnerable , but also failing our fellow believers . The reality is that there are a large number of committed pro-life Christians who are still completely unaware that the Democratic Party not only supports third-trimester and partial-birth abortions but that the party expects us to pay for them as well , regardless of whether it violates our conscience . <p> The reason our brothers and sisters in Christ remain unaware is that even when pastors and leaders speak out against abortion they often refuse to acknowledge who is enabling this policy . The reality is that the reason unrestricted abortion continues in American is not because of Planned Parenthood or the National Abortion Rights Action League but because of the Democratic Party . And they do so with both the direct and indirect support of the Church . <p> It shouldnt have taken a partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major political parties supports the right to kill a seven-pound baby who is days away from being born .

Ryle writes these words about the compilation of articles that will follow : " All of them , I venture humbly to think , will be found to contain some useful truths for the times , and words in season . " <p> Those words were written back in 1887 and yet , it is as though they were written for todayapplicable truths for this time , and needed words in this season . One of the articles in this book that impacted my heart most is an article written for parents about how to raise our children in the way they should go . Its a wonderful article full of convicting truth , but in every way seasoned with grace , intended to encourage , and full of hope . <p> Ryle calls the article " The Duties of Parents , " but I wonder , if he were one of our contemporaries and was writing today , perhaps J.C . Ryle would contribute to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every Christian Parent Must Do . " <p> The following 17 points are all Ryles points and words . The full article was several thousand words long , so I 've chosen favorite quotes from each point . I 'm writing them here not only to better remember them and engrain them upon my own heart , but also because I know others might benefit from these reminders , too . <p> 1 . Train them in the way they should go , and not in the way that they would . <p> The child knows not yet what is good for his mind and soul , any more than what is good for his body . You do not let him decide what he shall eat , and what he shall drink , and how he shall be clothed . Be consistent , and deal with his mind in like manner . Train him in the way that is scriptural and right , and not in the way that he fancies . <p> 2 . Train up your child with all tenderness , affection , and patience . <p> Love should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kindness , gentleness , long-suffering , forbearance , patience , sympathy , a willingness to enter into childish troubles , a readiness to take part in childish joysthese are the clues you must follow if you would find the way to his heart . Sternness and severity of manner chill them and throw them back . It shuts up their hearts , and you will weary yourself to find the door . <p> 3 . Train your children with an abiding persuasion on your mind that much depends upon you . <p> God gives your children a mind that will receive impressions like moist clay . He gives them a disposition at the starting point of life to believe what you tell them , and to take for granted what you advise them , and to trust your word rather than a strangers . He gives you , in short , a golden opportunity for doing them good . See that the opportunity be not neglected , and thrown away . Once let slip , it is gone forever . <p> 4 . Train with this thought continually before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to be considered . <p> Precious , no doubt , are these little ones in your eyes ; but if you love them , think often of their souls . No interest should weigh with you so much as their eternal interest . No part of them should be so dear to you as that part which will never die . The world , with all its glory , shall pass away ; the hills shall melt ; the heavens shall be wrapped together as a scroll ; the sun shall cease to shine . But the spirit which dwells in those little creatures , whom you love so well , shall outlive them all . <p> 5 . Train your child to a knowledge of the Bible . <p> See that they read it regularly . Train them to regard it as their souls daily foodas a thing essential to their souls daily health . I know well you can not make this anything more than a form , but there is no telling the amount of sin which a mere form may indirectly restrain . Fill their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly . Give them the Bible , the whole Bible , even while they are young . <p> 6 . Train them to a habit of prayer . <p> Prayer is the very life breath of true religion . Prayer is , of all habits , the one which we recollect the longest . Many a grey-headed man could tell you how his mother used to make him pray in the days of his childhood . Other things have passed away from his mind passed from his memory , and left no mark behind . But you will often find it is far different with his first prayers . He will often be able to tell you where he knelt , and what he was taught to say , and even how his mother looked all the while . Reader , if you love your children , I charge you , do not let the seed-time of a prayerful habit pass away unimproved . <p> 7 . Train them to habits of diligence and regularity about public means of grace . <p> Tell them the importance of hearing the Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sanctifying , and building up the souls of men . <p> 8 . Train them to a habit of faith . <p> I mean by this , you should train them up to believe what you say . You should try to make them feel confidence in your judgment , and respect your opinions as better than their own . Tell your children , too , that we must all be learners in our beginningsthat there is an alphabet to be mastered in every kind of knowledgethat the best horse in the world had need once to be brokenthat a day will come when they will see the wisdom of all your training . But in the meantime if you say a thing is right , it must be enough for themthey must believe you and be content . <p> 9 . Train them to a habit of obedience . <p> This is an object which it is worth any labour to attain . No habit , I suspect , has such an influence over our lives as this . <p> 10 . Train them to a habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times , that less than the truth is a lie ; that evasion , excuse making , and exaggeration are all half-way houses towards what is false , and ought to be avoided . Encourage them in any circumstances to be straightforward , and , whatever it may cost them , to speak the truth . <p> 11 . Train them to a habit of always redeeming the time . <p> Teach them the value of time , and try to make them learn the habit of using it well . It pains me to see children idling over what they have in hand , whatever it may be . I love to see them active and industrious , and giving their whole heart to all they do ; giving their whole heart to lessons , when they have to learn ; giving their whole heart even to their amusements , when they go to play . <p> 12 . Train them with a constant fear of over-indulgence . <p> Parents , I beseech you , for your childrens sake , beware of over-indulgence . I call on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their real interests , and not their fancies and likingsto train them , not to humor them , to profit , not merely to please . <p> 13 . Train them remembering continually how God trains His children . <p> There is no surer road to unhappiness than always having our own way . To have our wills checked and denied is a blessed thing for us ; it makes us value enjoyments when they come . To be indulged perpetually is the way to be made selfish ; and selfish people and spoiled children , believe me , are seldom happy . Reader , be not wiser than God ; train your children as he trains his . <p> 14 . Train them remembering continually the influence of your own example . <p> Be an example of reverence for the Word of God , reverence in prayer , reverence for means of grace , reverence for the Lords day . Be an example in words , in temper , in diligence , in temperance , in faith , in charity , in kindness , in humility . Think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You are their model picture , and they will copy what you are . Your reasoning and your lecturing , your wise commands and your good advice ; all this they may not understand , but they can understand your life . <p> 15 . Train them remembering continually the power of sin . <p> Children require no schooling to learn to sin . But you must not be discouraged and cast down by what you see . You must not think it a strange and unusual thing , that little hearts can be so full of sin . It is the only portion which our father Adam left us ; it is the fallen nature with which we come into the world ; it is that inheritance which belongs to us all . Let it rather make you more diligent in using every means which seem most likely , by Gods blessing , to counteract the mischief . <p> 16 . Train them remembering continually the promises of Scripture . <p> Train up your child in the way he should go , and when he is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think , too , what the promise contains , before you refuse to take comfort from it . It speaks of a certain time when good training shall especially bear fruit " when a child is old . " Surely there is comfort in this . You may not see with your own eyes the result of carefully training , but you know not what blessed fruits may spring from it , long after you are dead and gone . <p> 17 . Train them , lastly , with continual prayer for a blessing on all you do . <p> Without the blessing of the Lord , your best endeavours will do no good . He has the hearts of all men in His hands , and except He touch the hearts of your children by His Spirit , you will weary yourself to no purpose . Water , therefore , the seed you sow on their minds with unceasing prayer . The Lord is far more willing to hear than we to pray ; far more ready to give blessings than we to ask them ; but He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter of prayer before you , as the top stone and seal of all you do . <p> Conclusion <p> At the end of the article Ryle writes that he will pray for all who read this paper . Isnt that awesome ? Back in the 19th century , an old , gray-haired man was praying for all the parents who would read his wordsa prayer that , in Gods providence , would include fathers and mothers hundreds of years after his death . <p> The concluding words of Ryles prayer for the readers are these : " The Lord grant this , and then I have good hope that you will indeed train up your children welltrain well for this life , and train well for the life to come ; train well for earth , and train well for heaven ; train them for God , for Christ , and for eternity .

@@100509452 @4709452/ <h> I lost my dad in a plane crash , too <p> UPDATE ( May 19 , 2016 ) : Another mysterious airline tragedy is in the news today . EgyptAir flight 804 vanished from radar with 66 people aboard while making its way from Paris to Cairo . Incidents like this can fill us with fear and cause us to question the safety we perceive around us . This article was written last year to remind us of truth and point us to the solid Rock on which we stand . <p> One of the reasons I wanted to become an air traffic control officer in the Marine Corps is because I had faced my own aviation tragedy . When I was two years old in 1986 , my father was killed when the F-4 Phantom he was piloting collided with another F-4 off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean during a training maneuver . His body was never recovered . That event will forever shape my life . <p> Coping with the loss of a loved one in an aviation tragedy <p> As you can probably imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loved ones of a victim of an airplane crash face is not having a body to mourn . Sometimes bodies are recoverable , but in many cases , as in the recent Airbus tragedy , they are not . <p> An airplane crash makes death even more dramatic , too , since the loved one is seen by friends and family one moment only to take off on a plane the next and never be seen again . <p> Then there are the questions that follow in the wake of the tragedy . Did my loved one suffer ? Was it traumatic ? Did they have time for any last thoughts ? Did they survive the crash only to later ? <p> Then there are the deeper questions . Why did this happen to them ? What if they 'd taken an earlier or later flight ? If only . The " what if " scenarios can play out in your mind forever . <p> This Could Have Been Any of Us <p> Then there 's the question some may be thinking but probably not voicing : Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the myriad of plane trips I have taken ? <p> One idea prevalent in many world religions , including much of the modern West , is karmagood things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people . If we obey God and help others , in other words , God is obligated to give us longevity of life , nice possessions , healthy relationships , and good health . But if we 're selfish and harm others , we 're doomed to a terrible existence and possibly tragic death . <p> The reality according to the Bible , however , is that " good people " do n't exist . We are all sinners deserving death ( Rom. 3:23 ; 6:23 ) . <p> Paul puts it like this : " None is righteous , no , not one ; no one understands ; no one seeks for God . All have turned aside ; together they have become worthless ; no one does good , not even one " ( Rom. 3:11-12 ) . Even Christians , he later says , are still subject to pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now . the redemption of our bodies " ( Rom. 8:22-23 ) . <p> So the answer to the question is that these people who perished in the recent aviation tragedies were no worse than you and me . They were all sinners in need of grace . Perhaps some were even Christians . The reality is that because of sin , and unless Christ does not come back in our lifetimes , we will all die in some way . <p> Tragic Death Reminds Us to Flee to Christ <p> When I was a boy , God used my father 's tragic death ( he was a Christian ) to open my eyes to the sudden reality and finality of death and judgment . He used it as a beacon to lead me to Jesus . <p> Some people once asked Jesus about a devastating tragedy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been slaughtered by Pontius Pilate . Jesus replied to them , " Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered in this way ? No , I tell you ; but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish " ( Luke 13:2-3 ) . <p> Jesus ' point is that every one of us is a sinner deserving death and that death often comes unexpectedly , bringing us before the judgment of God . People who experience tragedy are no more deserving than we are . The suddenness of death reminds us to repent of sin and flee to Christ Jesus , so that we can escape eternal death in hell . That 's what Jesus is talking about . He continues : " Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them : do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem ? No , I tell you ; but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish " ( Luke 13:4-5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see R. C. Sproul 's article " When Towers Fall . " ) <p> What does Jesus mean by using the word repent ? He 's talking about more than a guilty conscience or convicted feeling regarding something we 've done wrong . He 's referring to a change of heart about who we are as people ( sinners before God ) and who Christ is ( our righteous sin-bearer ) . As John MacArthur explains , " Repentance is a spiritual turning , a total about-face . In the context of the new birth it means turning from sin to the Savior . " <p> How should we respond in the wake of tragedy ? <p> So how do we respond in the wake of such tragedy ? <p> We must first and foremost , seek God . Nahum the prophet wrote , " The Lord is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ; he knows those who take refuge in him " ( Nah 1:7 ) . Ultimately only God can provide peace and stability in the " day of trouble . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as much as possible about the last moments of their loved ones ' lives , and perhaps even find their loved one 's body . <p> We should remind ourselves that we too are still subject to death , and in fact will all die , unless Christ returns . We must continually look to our Savior , then , who has conquered death for us . <p> We should look for opportunities to share the hope of Christ Jesus , since everyone we know will also face death and ultimately stand before God in judgment . <p> We should thank God that those in Christ will experience a resurrection of life . Paul declares : " For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we shall be changed . For this perishable body must put on the imperishable , and this mortal body must saying that is written : ' Death is swallowed up in victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O death , where is your sting ? ' " ( 1 Cor. 15:52-55 ) .

@@100509454 @4709454/ <h> When Christian women seek the wrong validation <p> A well-meaning person in our church once openly questioned why my husband and I would choose to put our children in school rather than homeschooling them . This question came at a time when we were the only non-homeschooling family in our small group , and I had been privately wrestling with our choices as compared to theirs . I was wrestling , not because I felt convicted by the Lord , but because I longed for validation from people that I greatly respected . <p> Choosing man-made regulations <p> Admitting that we desire validation from others is difficult , but recognizing it in ourselves is even more difficult because it is a subtle , ever-lurking temptation . It tends to package itself together with pride , self-condemnation , or a desire for encouragement and approval .

Aside from living in a self-selected huddle , living by the goodness gospel does n't  bother us much . <p> The rub comes when we start questioning ourselves , like I did about our education choices . Of course , we must take into account that God may be leading us to make a change , but what I 'm referring to is when we feel not " good enough " in comparison to others and desire their validation .

This culminated in a panel on one of the Sunday talk shows suggesting that the law would return us to the days when signs would hang in stores detailing who would not be welcome to do business there . <p> The law , of course , does nothing of the sort . Indiana merely passed a state version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , the law that passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in 1993 and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton . The act was supported by a coalition spanning from the far Left to the far Right . <p> RFRA , of course , does not grant anyone the right to " discriminate " or deny service to anyone else .

But this contradicts the high view of work given in the opening pages of Scripture . Work shows up as part of God 's creative process . Genesis 2:2 reminds us that God " rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done . " If all of God 's creative acts are considered " work , " then one could deduce that work existed even before the creation of man and woman . <p> What 's more , God , in creating Adam and Eve in his own image , gave them important tasks . Adam was to " work and watch over " the beautiful Garden of Eden ( Gen. 2:15 ) . Rather than a punishment , work was a gift of grace from God to man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Work only became difficult when sin entered the world . Now rather than being an endless source of worship and creativity , work is toil . The earth , now touched by sin and death , would fight back ( Gen. 3:17-19 ) . But work itself is n't a result of the curse of sin ; it 's a gift from God . For this reason , Scripture counsels us against the sin of laziness ( Prov. 21:25-26 ) . To eschew hard work is to be unlike God , who took pleasure in his work as Creator ( Gen. 1:31 ) . <p> 2 . Remove the divide between secular and sacred work . <p> Many Christians hold a distinction between " secular " and " sacred " work . Work may seem useful for providing for our families , tithing a portion of our income , and serving as an opportunity for evangelism , but it 's often hard for us to see value in the actual work being done . So those who flip hamburgers or drive 18-wheelers may not seem as useful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work full-time for a church or Christian organization . But Scripture does n't offer such a workplace distinction because in God 's economy all work brings glory to him . <p> Creation was given to man to subdue , so every act of creation is a testament to the Creator . Tim Keller , author of Every Good Endeavor ( Dutton Adult ) , writes , " We 're continuing God 's work of forming , filling , and subduing . Whenever we bring order out of chaos , whenever we draw out creative potential , whenever we elaborate and ' unfold ' creation beyond where it was when we found it , we 're following God 's pattern of creative cultural development . " In his letter to the Colossians , Paul quotes King Solomon 's advice : " Whatever you do , do it enthusiastically , as something done for the Lord and not for men " ( Col. 3:23 ) . <p> We may be called to the mission field or to the pulpit or to the post office . Wherever our gifts and opportunities lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tasks he ordained before the world began ( Eph. 3:9-10 ) . <p> Work is an act of worship for the Creator who gave us hands and feet and minds to be employed for his service . <p> That 's why there 's no such thing as sacred or secular work . It 's all work on the grand canvas of God 's creation . I love Abraham Kuyper 's quote : " In the total expanse of human life , there 's not a single square inch of which the Christ , who alone is sovereign , does not declare , ' That is mine ! ' " <p> 3 . Revive a healthy work-life balance . <p> Since creation , God instituted patterns for healthy rhythms of work and rest . God worked six days and rested on the seventh . This pattern was enforced as law for the nation of Israel as a way of relaxing the body and soul and reminding the Jewish people of their humanity and need for God . Today , followers of Jesus are no longer under the rigid enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between work and rest . <p> Humans are given to two extremes that violate Sabbath rhythms . There 's the inclination to avoid work and pursue pleasure . And there 's the temptation to eschew rest entirely , yielding to pressure to be all about work and no play . <p> Scripture reminds us of the importance of rest . Jesus , in his full humanity , took periodic moments for rest of body and soul and counseled his disciples to do the same ( Mark 6:30-32 ) . Resting from our labors revives and refreshes the soul - it reminds us we are human and not God . A restless life is a sign that work , a gift from God , has supplanted him as the god . Be intentional about building regular times for rest , good sleep and periodic vacations into your schedule . The psalmist wrote about God 's understanding of our humanity : " He knows what we are made of , remembering that we are dust " ( Ps. 103:14 ) . <p> 4 . Resist the lust for materialism . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of materialism . It 's problematic because , though it 's easy to spot someone else 's greed , it 's difficult to find our own . <p> Scripture is clear that wealth is n't , in and of itself , evil . Some of God 's greatest men ( Job , Abraham , Joseph , Jacob , Solomon ) were men of means . Yet we know of the inherent dangers that prosperity can bring . Heed Paul 's warning to young Timothy : " But those who want to be rich fall into temptation , a trap , and many foolish and harmful desires , which plunge people into ruin and destruction . For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil , and by craving it , some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains " ( 1 Tim . 6:9-10 ) . <p> Greed , however , is n't a sin reserved for the rich . It is n't measured by the size of one 's pocketbook . It 's a matter of the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's easier to judge others for perceived greed than to spot the cancer in our souls . <p> The cure for materialism is to re-orient one 's gaze from money and toward the giver of good gifts . The gospel applied in liberal doses can convert greed into contentment and materialism into generosity . <p> 5 . Remember your real identity . <p> When meeting someone for the first time , the first question typically asked is , " What do you do for a living ? " We 're most often identified by our vocation . As Christians , we must rest in our identity as God 's chosen , redeemed children rather than the identity assigned to us by how we make a living . <p> This is especially important during seasons of extended unemployment and advanced age . In today 's struggling economy , there are many longtime workers who find themselves out of a job and seemingly without purpose . Some have been forced into the humility of taking jobs well below their training and pay grade . It can be embarrassing to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel gives the Christian an identity beyond what he does with his hands . Work is a sacred gift from God , but it should n't be the object of worship . If one is Christ 's , he or she has a higher identity . Like Paul who , after his conversion on the road to Damascus , was faced with the indignity of imprisonment , beatings , and betrayal , one can say with a heart full of joy , " Because of Christ I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them filth , so that I may gain Christ and be found in him " ( Phil . 3:8-9 ) . No negative evaluation from a boss and no hotly competitive workplace environment have the power to shape one 's worth in God 's eyes . He loves us and has secured our eternal destiny . <p> This is n't all Scripture says about work but may it start us on the path to seeing our work as a God-ordained opportunity to bring him glory and contribute to the flourishing of his creation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays .

@@100509460 @4709460/ <h> Does Jesus want you to be poor ? <p> We 've all heard the popular teaching of Joel Osteen and the promises of the " health and wealth gospel . " Preachers on television are promising us that God wants us to be happy , healthy and rich . The level of faith that we have directly parallels our financial and personal success . The Prayer of Jabez , after all , is an example of praying for our own personal prosperity and God blessed him and called him righteous , right ? <p> The opposite extreme sprinkled throughout evangelicalism today looks at the church in large . They consider the persecuted church , they examine revivals , history , and the overall nature of the church to say that no , Jesus is not concerned with making us rich , but that he wants us to give to the poor and to live a simple life . Ultimately they become various levels of ascetics . <p> Does Jesus want us to be rich ? Or does Jesus want us to be poor ? <p> We are called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his masters will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will , will receive many lashes , but the one who did not know it , and committed deeds worthy of a flogging , will receive but few . From everyone who has been given much , much will be required ; and to whom they entrusted much , of him they will ask all the more " ( Luke 12.47-48 ) . <p> This passage is extremely familiar . Surprisingly , however , it is speaking about actions and not finances . It is a principle that applies over and onto finances , but God is concerned about our hearts . Jesus himself said that all of the Law was summed up in these two : love God above all else and love your neighbor as yourself ( Matt. 22:37-39 ) . If we love God above all else , then our talents , our time and our finances will be spent to his glory and honor . If we love our neighbor as ourselves , we help meet their needs , we put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finances . <p> Paul makes the very clear assessment of our abilities ( which again , applies to finances ) : " For who regards you as superior ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ? " ( 1 Cor. 4:7 ) . <p> But most fundamentally we all know that " the Earth is the Lords and everything it contains " ( 1 Cor. 10:26 ) . <p> It all belongs to God . Everything . Including money . So whatever you have gifts , talents , finances , freedom , jobs , family it is all Gods . And he has allowed us to use it for a season . We are stewards of his belongings . <p> For my ascetic friends , I would like to point out the fact that many of our forefathers were among the richest men who ever lived . Solomon was worth , in todays dollar , approximately 100 billion dollars . That is substantially more than Bill Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others were granted physical and financial wealth in the roles that God gave them . <p> For my rich friends , I would like to point out the fact that the very humility exemplified by the creator of the universe was to leave the throne of glory and come to Earth , living without even a place to lay his head . He kept minimal possessions and when he sent the disciples out to serve him , they were to rely on the hospitality of others for their sustenance . <p> Our responsibility is stewardship of what God has given us . When we consider our finances , let 's ask this simple question , " Is God glorified in this ? " When you stand before God on Judgment Day , will you be ashamed of how you spent your money and time ? Will you be proud of the toys , clothes , house and other comforts that you bought ? Or will you know that you gave sacrificially to feed the hungry , clothe the naked and put one anothers needs above your own ? Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? <p> I used to wrestle with giving money to beggars . I always wondered for what they would use the money . But one day I realized that God would hold him accountable for how he used the help that he received . He would only hold me accountable for my willingness to help . I am confident that I will not stand before him and he say , " You should not have given that money to that beggar . You should have bought a new shirt with it instead . " Now , if God has given you the mind and ability to help the homeless establish themselves in jobs and fight addictions such that they are able to feed themselves , and all you do is throw a $20 in their cup , there might be something to answer for . But that is between you and God . <p> Jesus was comfortable with a woman pouring out extremely expensive perfume on his feet . There are times for extravagance in the worship of almighty God . Jesus does not say that to follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are to care for the poor . So we must be stable enough to be able to give in order to care for the poor . <p> Its about our heart .

I know how to get along with humble means , and I also know how to live in prosperity ; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry , both of having abundance and suffering need . I can do all things through Him who strengthens me " ( Phil 4.11-13 ) . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

Just to provide a little bit of context , here is a brief explanation of PTSD : <p> According to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( 2013 ) , those with PTSD have experienced a horrifying event that has resulted in them re-experiencing the trauma , avoiding reminders of the trauma , having negative thoughts and moods , and experiencing increased arousal ( such as irritability or trouble with sleep ) for more than a month . In order to receive this diagnosis , one must be assessed by a mental health professional and meet certain diagnostic criteria based on what is listed above . <p> According to the National Institute of Mental Health , 3.5 percent of adults suffer from PTSD ( 2013 ) . However , the National Center for PTSD states that twice that will experience PTSD at some point in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can increase significantly . For example , it is believed that among Vietnam veterans , 30 percent have PTSD ( NCPTSD , 2014 ) . As of yet , it is harder to pin down a number for those who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan , but it is believed to be anywhere from 11-20 percent . In addition to combat experiences , sexual assault can trigger PTSD , and approximately 23 percent of women report this experience during their military careers ( NCPTSD , 2014 ) . Men also experience sexual trauma while in the service and develop PTSD as a result . <p> Offering support and holding out hope <p> Supporting those with PTSD may not come easy . Those who are struggling with this difficult disorder may have a tough time with sleep . They may have a difficult time being in crowds . They may jump at the sound of firecrackers or a car backfiring . Things that most people consider enjoyable may lead to fear in those with PTSDfor example , going to the movie theatre , shopping at a mall or attending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans changed or cancelled , deal with someone who is irritable due to insomnia , or be awakened in the middle of the night because a loved one has had a nightmare , again . Sometimes , the symptoms of PTSD are even more severe and cause significant problems within relationships . <p> However , families can work together to cope with this disorder . One of the most important factors is the installation of hope . PTSD does not have to be something that the service member deals with forever . It does not have to be something that robs those with PTSD from having healthy relationships and joyful lives . There is hope for recovery and stability . And , having the family there for support , and possibly involvement in the PTSD therapy , may aid in the effectiveness of the treatment for the individual with PTSD ( Monson , Macdonald , and Brown-Bowers , 2012 ) . <p> Does someone you care about have PTSD ?

If they are willing to try shopping , for example , be willing to leave when your loved one is ready to or drive separate cars and allow them to leave when they are ready . Do n't  force your loved one to continue with the status quo as if nothing has changed . They may no longer like crowds or fireworks or large family gatherings .

It may also be helpful for you to participate in a support group for those whose loved ones have PTSD ( Many Vet Centers offer these . ) . <p> Pray . John Bunyan said , " You can do more than pray , after you have prayed , but you can not do more than pray until you have prayed . " As Christians , we must pray .

@@100509462 @4709462/ <h> What does the Bible say about sexual assault ? <p> Never before has the issue of sexual assault against women seemed so ubiquitous . In January a Nashville jury convicted two Vanderbilt University students of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery when they assaulted a student in a dorm room in 2013 . Amid widespread campus sexual assault , 80 percent of which goes unreported , many hope this strong ruling will communicate to other victims of rape that they , too , will be heard . The case is just one of many instances of on-campus sexual assault , some of which have gone unaddressed , despite being reported . And sexual violence on college campuses is not the only mainstream news story concerning rape . Last fall witnessed the staggering number of allegations of sexual assault committed by comedian and household name , Bill Cosby . According to these women , their assaults have been kept quiet for the better part of a lifetime . From college sophomores to senior adults , women are speaking out and seeking justice . <p> The Bible is not silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heartbreaking , even gruesome . But they are not brushed under a rug or hushed up . In fact , of the three accounts describing a woman who was sexually assaulted , each of them precipitated civil war . When Jacobs daughter , Dinah , was violated by the son of a neighboring ruler , Shechem , her brothers murdered him , his father , and the all of the men of his city in revenge ( Gen. 34 ) . After the Unnamed Concubine was gang-raped and left for dead by men in the tribe of Benjamin , the other tribes went to war against them upon hearing of her injustice ( Jgs. 19-21 ) . And after Tamar was raped by her half-brother , Amnon , her brother Absalom killed him , and incited a rebellion against his father , King David ( 2 Sam . 13 ) . Rape was neither covered up nor ignored . Instead , it was answered and avenged . It was such a cultural convulsion that it was answered with outrage and further violence . The cases of rape in Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing today : These women must be heard and they must be protected . <p> The Old Testament Law gives us an even greater picture of just how much God takes up the cause of the victim and the vulnerable . There is one passage in particular , Deuteronomy 22:23-29 , that safeguarded women who had been violated . Like all of the legal codes , these laws reveal the heart and character of God . <p> Deuteronomy 22:23-24 <p> " If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man , and another man finds her in the city and lies with her , then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death ; the girl , because she did not cry out in the city , and the man , because he has violated his neighbors wife . Thus you shall purge the evil from among you . " <p> Compared to the other scenarios in this passage , these verses describe a consensual encounter . This law does not use terms like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds " ( matsa ) . The significant thing in this verse is the surroundings it defines . Since it is described as happening in city , it implies that there were people nearby who could have helped her had she cried out . Since she did n't  , the implication is that she did not resist , and , therefore , she is also responsible . Because she was betrothed to another man , she was already considered his wife , making this equivalent to adultery ( Deut. 22:22 ) . <p> Deuteronomy 22:25-27 <p> " But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged , and the man forces her and lies with her , then only the man who lies with her shall die . But you shall do nothing to the girl ; there is no sin in the girl worthy of death , for just as a man rises against his neighbor and murders him , so is this case . When he found her in the field , the engaged girl cried out , but there was no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first read this passage ! Not only did the rapist receive the death penalty , but the woman was protected from all recourse . She was neither shamed nor shunned . The word used for " force " ( chazaq ) in this verse is rather specific , especially since it is n't used in either of the other two laws . It means to take or keep hold of , specifically to seize with violence . The location is significant here also . Unlike the first scenario in which the woman was within earshot of help , this woman was caught in a secluded place , alone and defenseless . She cried out for help but was overpowered , " but there was no one to save her . " God defends her innocence and ensures both her protection and her reputation . He shielded her from blame for the assault and shame after it occurred . <p> Deuteronomy 22:28-29 <p> " If a man finds a girl who is a virgin , who is not engaged , and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall become his wife because he has violated her ; he can not divorce her all his days . " <p> The implications of this law are more subtle , but equally significant . This verse does not use the word for " force " ( chazaq ) ; it uses the word for " seize " ( taphas ) , which can also mean to lay hold of or wield . Its other uses have the idea of capturing or overwhelming ( 2 Kings 14:13 ) . Unlike the other two scenarios , this one concerns an unengaged virgin and does not specify where the violation took place . Also , there 's another detail in this law that is quite telling . The verse uses the phrase " they are discovered . " The language moves from an individual man and an individual woman to a " they . " ( Hang with me , here . ) Coupled with the fact that this verse does not use the same verb for " force , " I believe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she overwhelmed ? Yes . Did this dishonor her ? Unquestionably . Is the man responsible for violating her ? Absolutely . <p> But the Holy Spirit inspired a different word in verses 28-29 than the verb used in verses 25-27 and He did it intentionally ( 2 Tim . 3:16-17 , 2 Pet . 1:19-21 ) . The detail that they are discovered together implies some level of mutual responsibility that is different from what we see in verses 25-27 ( If you 've season one of Downton Abbey , think Mary Crawley and the Turkish diplomat ) . The man is held accountable and must marry ( and provide for ) the woman . Plus , he can never divorce her for the rest of his life . Exodus 22:16-17 describes a similar scenario , where a young woman is " seduced , " and adds that the father can refuse to give his consent to the marriage . But the man still had to pay the price of a dowry , which means he was out the money set aside for a bride , and he still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl . For the young woman who was seduced , there is no indication that she was ostracized from her community or shunned by her family . Instead , she was vindicated and her honor was restored . What does this mean ? He could n't use her and lose her . A man couldnt take a woman as an object of pleasure and then bear no responsibility for her . God was protecting the woman in this situation from being left without protection and provision . Women were not to be used and discarded . <p> An assault against Eden <p> Some look at these laws and claim that the Bible permits , even legalizes sexual assault ; therefore , the Bible is oppressive to women . Yet , in each of these scenarios , the victim is protected and the violator is punished . Where the woman was not at fault , she never received blame . If fact , she was vindicated . None of these situations were supposed to happen . God never intended for women to be violated and He certainly does n't  turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set Gods people apart from their surrounding cultures .

@@100509464 @4709464/ <h> Why do pastors receive a tax exemption for housing ? <p> A federal judge recently ruled that an Internal Revenue Service exemption that gives clergy tax-free housing allowances is unconstitutional . In her ruling U.S. District Court Judge Crabb claims that , " Some might view a rule against preferential treatment as exhibiting hostility toward religion , but equality should never be mistaken for hostility . " <p> Despite the judges claim , appealing to " equality " is not enough to make the action non-hostile nor is it in line with previous court decisions . Not only has the Supreme Court previously stated that the Establishment Clause prohibits hostility against religion as much as it prohibits the establishment of a state religion , it has also noted that its " precedents plainly contemplate that on occasion some advancement of religion will result from governmental action . " <p> But aside from the question of constitutionality , the clergy exemption raises a question that many people whether religious or not are likely to be wondering : Why exactly do ministers receive a tax exemption for their housing allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how taxation of church property , including clergy housing , has historically been considered . <p> Since at least the time when Joseph served in Pharaohs Egypt , religious property has been exempt from certain forms of taxation . ( Genesis 47:26 ) The practice continued in the Roman Empire and through medieval Europe and was part of the common law , which America adopted from England . The common law granted tax exemptions to established churches and , through the equity law tradition , to all churches . From the 15th century to the 19th century , most pastors lived in the parsonage , a house provided by the church . Housing was thus a form of non-cash payment that was exempt from taxation since the parsonage was church property . <p> By the early 20th century , though , both clergy housing and taxation had changed considerably . So in 1921 , Congress passed the Revenue Act , which exempted from the gross income of ministers the rental value of any " dwelling house and appurtenances thereof " provided by a church as a part of clergy compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers who lived on property owned by their church and disadvantaged ministers whose churches provided a housing allowance rather than a church-owned parsonage . In 1954 , Congress amended the tax code to allow ministers to exempt a portion of their income to the extent used by the minister for housing . According to the Senate Report , the purpose of this addition was to eliminate the disparity in the tax code between ministers who lived in a church-owned parsonage and those who were given a stipend with which to secure housing . <p> The clergy , of course , are not the only ones to receive such an exemption . Congress included several categories of tax-free housing allowances to demonstrate a willingness to give tax breaks to classes of taxpayers who have little choice about their personal living space , such as members of the military , members of the Peace Corps , members of the Foreign Service , etc . As Peter J. Reilly explains , <p> Whether the employer provides a cash allowance or a home , each benefit serves the same purpose ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its employees . Many times , these classes of employees frequently relocate , thus preventing them from settling down and hindering long term close friendships . Further , the employers frequently require them to use their homes to conduct employer business . Additionally , the employees place of service may not be desirable . These employees must reside where their employer requires and must frequently use their residence for employer business . Some employees sacrifice amenities that most citizens take for granted , such as long term stability in one locale and privacy . <p> The constitutionality of the parsonage exemption would be difficult to challenge since it has been encoded in statutory law for over almost a hundred years . That is why critics of clergy exemptions have focused on the housing allowance . <p> The obvious counter might appear to be for churches to simply buy a parsonage and directly provide housing for their ministers . But this ignores the fact there may be theological reasons based on church polity for not providing a parsonage . As Justin Butterfield , Hiram Sasser , and Reed Smith explain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " congregations choice to offer a housing allowance rather than allow the minister to live in a church-owned dwelling is not one of mere accounting or convenience , but rather one rich with theological and ecclesiastical underpinnings . " <p> The parsonage exemption , for instance , provides a preference for institutional churches whose ecclesiastical properties are owned by a central governing body ( e.g. , Roman Catholic ) . Smaller , independent , local churches often have less money to provide a parsonage . It also presents a bias in favor of wealthy , established churches over younger congregations and church startups . For instance , how could a congregation that cant even afford a church building afford to buy a parsonage ? <p> Because of this reality , the courts can not allow the parsonage exemption and exclude the housing exemption without showing preference for certain religious groups over others . <p> Both the parsonage and pastor housing exemption are part of a legal tradition that serve to prevent the entanglement of the state in ecclesiological concerns . By her decision , though , Judge Crabb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax code . In her attempt to prevent an imaginary violation of the Establishment Clause she has inadvertently created a real infringement .

@@100509470 @4709470/ <h> The Quaker Exemption and Religious Liberty Today <p> As oral arguments begin in Hobby Lobbys challenge to the HHS abortifacient mandate , we might ask what the Founders would think about this case ? On one hand , they could not have imagined it . The public sale of government-approved contraceptives and abortifacients ( and to be fair , that of most modern medicines of any kind ) would have been unfathomable in 1776 . And the notion of a government requiring businesses to provide contraceptive and abortifacient coverage ? Such an idea could never have occurred to them . <p> But part of the debate would have struck them as quite familiar : the concept that certain laws might require exemptions for those who objected on religious grounds . For the Founders , the most common cases of such exemptions involved Quakers . The Quakers were one of the most radical groups emerging from the English Reformation , and in the 1680s they founded Pennsylvania . Quakers were pacifists and refused military service . They also objected to the swearing of oaths , a common practice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Quakers opposition to oaths was based on a plain reading of Matthew 5:33-37 , in which Jesus said " cometh of evil . " ( KJV ) Early Americans assumed that requiring an oath for legislators or participants in court cases would help guarantee honesty and integrity , but those requirements functionally banned Quakers from accessing some of the most basic institutions of government . <p> By the eighteenth century , many American colonies had begun to enact exemptions for Quakers so they would not have to swear oaths . Typically this involved allowing objectors to " affirm " that they would tell the truth or do their duty , a compromise which satisfied Quakers objections . This policy became so entrenched in American law that the Constitutions oath of office for the President of the United States . " According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear ( or affirm ) to uphold the laws and Constitution of the United States , concluding with the petition , " so help me God . " But the act also noted that the " words , so help me God , shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath . " <p> Quakers were also afforded exemptions from military service , and along with Baptists , they asked for and sometimes received relief from the religious taxes imposed by many of the colonies to support established denominations , usually either the Anglican or Congregationalist Church . Often the colonies would require dissenters like the Baptists to produce a certificate showing that they were really active in a dissenting congregation and not just trying to avoid the tax . But that system was clumsy , and Baptists in the Revolutionary era resented having to do anything to get out of paying a tax they considered a violation of conscience in any case . <p> The Baptists opposition to state establishments of religion , and to the exemption certificates , set the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious establishments of any kind . That campaign helped to end most official state support for particular denominations . Along with prominent political leaders such as James Madison , Baptist pressure helped ensure a national commitment to full religious freedom , as articulated in the First Amendment . <p> The great Baptist champion of religious liberty , John Leland , a staunch ally of Madison and Thomas Jefferson , acknowledged that religious dissenters could not be allowed to " disturb the peace " and harm fellow citizens under the cover of conscience objections . However , he insisted that governments which really valued religious liberty should afford exemptions to laws that " prevent liberty of conscience , ... because men can not stretch their consciences like a nose of wax . " Sincere religious non-conformists should not be treated like common vagrants , he said . <p> Extending exemptions for cases of religious conscience is a longstanding part of Americas effort to ensure both the rule of law and real religious liberty . Secularist advocates today will argue that religious freedom does not extend beyond the walls of congregations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religious liberty was public liberty . <p> Secularist advocates will similarly argue that we can not account for the messiness of religious liberty claims we can never judge the validity of the many possible conscience claims , they say . The public good ( meaning , in the case of the HHS Mandate , broad access to health care , including abortifacients ) must trump dissenting religious concerns . But again , the Founders realized that government would have to accommodate sincere religious objections , even when majorities in a legislature believed that a law served the public good . <p> Any reasonable observer can see that the Green family of Hobby Lobby ( as well as their co-litigants Conestoga Wood ) has a sincere religious objection to providing abortifacient coverage to employees . Their convictions represent an honest , longstanding objection to abortion held by many other Americans . The HHS Mandate , conversely , represents an abrupt , intrusive requirement of the national government that has obvious ramifications for the consciences of many American employers .

But think of the qualifications Jesus gives for his churchs pastors . They must not be " quarrelsome " and they must be " well thought of by outsiders " ( 1 Tim . 3:3,7 ) . That 's in the same list as not being a heretic or a drunk . <p> Your presence should be one of peace and tranquility . The gospel you believe ought to be what disrupts . There 's a big difference . <p> 2 . Honor . The Scripture tells us to fear God , to obey the king , and to honor ( notice this ) everyone ( 1 Pet . 2:17 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan , they are still your parents . If cousin Betty V. does Jello shots in her car , just to take the edge off the cocaine , well , she still bears the imprint of the God you adore . <p> You can not do the will of God by opposing the will of God . That is , you cant evangelize by dishonoring father and mother , or by disrespecting the image-bearers of God . Pray for God to show you the ways those in your life are worthy of honor , and teach your children to follow you in showing respect and gratitude . <p> 3 . Humility . Part of the reason some Christians have such difficulty with unbelieving or nominally believing extended family members is right at this point . They see differences over Jesus as being of the same kind ( just of a different degree ) as our differences over , say , the war in Afghanistan or the future of Sarah Palin or the Saints winning streak this year . <p> Often the frustration comes not because of how much Christians love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be right . The professional Left and Right cable-TV and talk-radio pontificators may value the last word , but we cant . <p> Jesus never , not once , seeks to prove he is right , and he was accused of being everything from a wino to a demoniac . He rejects Satans temptation to force a visible vindication , waiting instead for God to vindicate him at the empty tomb . <p> Often Christians veer toward Satanism at holiday time because we , deep down , pride ourselves on knowing the truth of the gospel . The rage you feel when Uncle Happy says why " many roads lead to God " might be more about the fact that you want to be right than that you want him to be resurrected . <p> Plus , we often forget just how it is that we came to be in Christ in the first place . This was n't some act of brilliance , like being accepted into Harvard or some exertion of the will , like learning to put a Rubiks cube together in 20 seconds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Apostle Paul asks us , " And if you received it , then why do you boast as though you did n't  receive it ? " ( 1 Cor. 4:6-7 ) <p> Satan wants to destroy you through his primal flaw , pride ( 1 Pet . 5:7-9 ; 1 Tim . 3:6 ) . He does n't  care if that pride comes through looking around the family table and figuring out how much more money you make than your second cousin-in-law or whether it comes by your looking around the table and saying , " Thank you Lord that I am not like these publicans . " The end result is the same ( Prov. 29:23 ) . <p> Unless you 're in an exceptionally sanctified family , you 're going to see failing marriages , parenting crises , and a thousand other shards of the curse . If your response is to puff up as you look at your own situation , there 's a Satanist at your family gathering , and you 're it . <p> 4 . Maturity . The Scripture tells us that if we follow Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to suffering , and ultimately to glory . Often we think these testings are big , monumental things , but they rarely are . <p> God will allow you to be tested . Hell refine you , bring you to the fullness of maturity in Christ . He probably wo n't do it by your fighting lions before the emperor or standing with a John 3:16 sign before a tank in the streets of Beijing . More likely , it will be through those seemingly little places of temptationlike whether you 'll love the belching brother-in-law at the other end of the table who wants to talk about how the Cubans killed JFK and how to make $100,000 a year selling herbal laxatives on the Internet . <p> Some of the tensions Christians face at holiday time have nothing to do with outside oppression as much as internal immaturity on the part of the Christians themselves . <p> I 've had young men who tell me they feel treated like children when they go home to see their extended families . Their parents or parents-in-law are dictating to them where to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents or parent-in-law are hijacking the rearing of their children ( " Oh , come on ! He can watch Die Harder ! Do n't  be so strict ! " ) . Some of these men just give in , and then seethe in frustration . <p> Sometimes that 's because the extended family is particularly obstinate . But sometimes the extended family treats the young man like a child because that 's how he acts the rest of the year . Do n't  live financially and emotionally dependent on your parents or in-laws , passively dithering in your decisions about your familys future , and then expect them to see you as the head of your house . <p> Be a man ( if you are one ) . Make decisions ( including decisions about where , and for how long , you 'll spend the holidays ) . Teach and discipline your children.Your extended family might not like it at first , but theyll come to respect the fact that you 're leaving and cleaving , taking responsibility for that which has been entrusted to you . <p> 5 . Perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every idle ( that means seemingly tiny , insignificant , unmemorable ) thought , word , and deed . At the Judgment Seat of the Lord Christ , you 'll be responsible for living out the gospel in every arena to which the Spirit has led you including Aunt Flossies dining room table . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509473 @4709473/ <h> What to think of Bill Cosby <p> This Washington Post report about Bill Cosby is profoundly disturbing . We have to acknowledge that he has yet to be tried in a court of law . Still , this story stirs up in me two feelings that I suspect are common among those who have been Cosby fans for a long time , as I have been . <p> There is the sense of profound sadness over the revelation that a revered icon may be a serial fraud . Cosby is so gifted at making us laugh , so representative of a father figure we wish everyone could have , so emblematic , in his sitcoms , of the kind of wholesome two-parent family we believe is Gods best design for human flourishing . And yet it seems that everything he portrayed on TV is the exact opposite to the kind of man he is reported to be . <p> This is the kind of deep and terrible disappointment that comes when someone we admire is not even close to what we thought they were . In the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of their own sins . One by one institutions and people we 've come to trust are proving no longer trustworthy . This is bad for our culture , but also reminds us that all meneven revered public figuresare tainted by sin and that there is only one real , perfect example in Christ upon whom we can truly project our longings . <p> But there is another feeling that moves beyond disappointment to rage . There is a morally justifiable anger at a powerful and connected man who is alleged to have used his position to systematically prey upon vulnerable young women . Even if only a fraction of the allegations are trueand with over twenty women coming forward , its hard to escape the overwhelming circumstantial evidenceits a scandal that Cosby wasnt prosecuted long ago . <p> I 'm a father of three girls .

First is the recognition that as fallen sinners , we are capable of the very crimes Bill Cosby is alleged to have perpetrated . Only Christ can redeem us and replace hearts of stone with hearts of love , made possible by the blood of his cross and his triumphant resurrection . <p> The other idea we hold is that , as Christs ambassadors of reconciliation , we fight for justice in the world . This means fighting against injustice . The gospel does n't  just make us nice people . It makes us warriors and healers . <p> It is this prophetic voice the world needs to hear when it comes to alleged predators like Bill Cosby . There is a tendency to want to ignore or even protect him because he portrayed , on the screen , a kind of family structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no defense of Bill Cosbys alleged actions . <p> The Church , specifically Christian men , have to speak out loudly against assault against women . We must be a refuge for the voiceless , the vulnerable , and the violated in a Fallen world . They must hear of a God who loves them and a Christ who came to set them free . They must find in us an advocate for justice , their justice . <p> Its sad that well never remember Bill Cosby as we once knew him . But his fall from grace is not the real tragedy here . Not even close . The real tragedy is the lost innocence of the many female victims , whove had to live scarred lives because of this predatory behavior . <p> Let 's make sure we do n't preach a partial gospel that only preaches forgiveness for the worst sinners ; let 's preach a gospel that also offers healing and hope for those victimized by the Fall . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> I was young when I first saw the Academy Award-winning film , " To Kill A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every aspect of what was happening in the story , but what I picked up on had me in tears ....

@@100509475 @4709475/ <h> Wanted : Parents willing to get too attached <p> Its been just over eight months since my husband and I brought our sweet baby boy home from the hospital . Memories of what life was like before his arrival are faint . We cant imagine our day-to-day without his crinkled-nose smiles or his excited shrieks of delight . Life as a family of three is our new normal , and while being a mommy to our little one is more exhausting than I thought possible , it is also more joy-filled and abundant than I expected . This deep joy of motherhood , however , is also mingled with sadness ; sadness because the time is soon approaching when our days will no longer be filled with this little ones sweet shrieks of delight . My heart aches knowing that while we have been able to enthusiastically cheer on his first attempts to crawl , it is unlikely that we will be able to experience his first steps , first words , or his first day of school . <p> Our little one is not terminally i 'll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital nearly nine months ago is our foster son . In the next month or two he will likely leave our home and be adopted by his extended family members . Were grateful that our foster son has family members who want to raise him as their own . Yet , deep grief fills our hearts knowing we will not be able to make this son we love a permanent part of our family . Its overwhelming thinking of the day we will have to strap him in his car seat for the last time , kiss his big , soft cheeks , and say our good-byes . <p> At times I wonder if we were crazy to get ourselves into this . Foster care is a messy , complicated process , filled with messy , complicated emotions . When we tell people he is our foster son , they usually commend us then quickly add , " I could never do foster care , I would get too attached . " But that 's the point . <p> Great pain for a great need <p> We do n't  have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakable . And detachment is n't feasible , nor is it desirable . Parents who are willing to get " too attached " are precisely what children in foster care need . And the need is enormous : <p> There are over 510,000 children in the foster care system in the U.S. Of those kids , over 100,000 of them are waiting to be adopted , but nearly 19,000 will age-out of the system every year before they have the chance . <p> The kids who leave foster care without being linked to " forever families " are highly likely to experience homelessness , unemployment , and incarceration as adults . Thirty percent of homeless people in the U.S. were once formerly in the foster care system . <p> The issue of attachment looms large . Having never learned how to attach to people or places , they struggle to have healthy relationships , stay in school , and hold down a job later in life . <p> It is crucial at each stage of developmentinfants , toddlers , and young childrento learn how to attach . Even if children do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , it is better for them to go through the pain of loss than to never attach to anyone at all . <p> By Gods grace , we will survive the grief of giving up our foster son . Though the pain will be great , we have the coping skills and resources to deal with the loss . But if he were to go without the love and attachment he needs at this point in his development , it would n't be something he could simply catch up on later in life . Its crucial for his sake that we risk the pain of getting " too attached . " <p> Jesus says , " Whoever finds his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it " ( Matt. 10:39 ) . We want to lose our lives for the sake of our foster son ; not only because he needs us to , but because Christ met our even more desperate need . Every dirty diaper , every night-time feeding , every heart-wrenching visit with his birth parents , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are losing our lives . We are giving our hearts away to this little boy we have no promise of keeping . Still , no matter the sacrifices we make , they pale compared to all that Christ sacrificed to save us . <p> Children are a gift . They are never ours to possess . That seems obvious with foster care . But its no less true with biological children . After suffering a miscarriage last October , we were delighted to find out we were expecting again four months later . A week after the positive pregnancy test , we received the phone call for our foster son . It has been a crazy season , but as I care for the two children the Lord has given us , one inside , and one out , I am reminded that they are gifts . I am not promised tomorrow with either of them . We are never promised to keep any of the children the Lord entrusts to us .

He is the creator and sustainer of lifeall of it . <p> God over foster care <p> Whether I become a mother biologically or through foster care , my children belong to God , not me . Expecting a new baby does not make the loss of another baby easier . The thrill of expecting a baby and the sorrow of anticipating the loss of another do not cancel each other out . Deep joy and profound grief are mingled together in our hearts . In the midst of these muddled emotions , we have found much instruction and comfort in the book of Job . Though the giving and taking did not perhaps happen at the same time for Job , he blessed the Lord for both . He recognized that the same God who had given him everything he had was the same God who was taking it away . Even more , in all his suffering , he " did not sin or charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to acknowledge the goodness of God both in the joyful blessings and in the painful takings . <p> The same God who gave and took our first child through miscarriage is the same God who brought our precious foster son to our home a few months later . The same God who gave us another new life inside of my womb is the same God directing the number of days our foster son will spend in our home . Daily we are trusting that he is good in all of it : the giving and the taking . " He gives and he takes away , blessed be the name of the Lord " ( Job 1:21 ) . <p> Opening your heart to love any child is risky and requires a loss of self . Opening your heart and home to a foster child may seem especially risky . But in losing ourselves , we gain . We grow in understanding how Jesus loved us and gave himself up for us . In seeking to love sacrificially , we pray others will see a picture of the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lead our foster son to one day trust in Jesus , the one who gave him far more than we ever could . We also pray that believers everywhere will join us and risk becoming " too attached " for the sake of the children in need , and the glory of the one who alone makes such risk possible . 43172 @qwx903172 43176 @qwx903176

@@100509478 @4709478/ <h> TRANSCRIPT : Should a Christian listen to the Serial podcast ? <p> Questions and Ethics with Russell Moore Should a Christian listen to the Serial podcast ? <p> Dan Darling : Welcome back to Questions and Ethics with Dr. Russell Moore . Dr. Moore , our question comes in today from Twitter . A fan of the podcast , Serial , which both you and I have listened to , has asked should our consciences bother us about this podcast given that its a real-life crime story , and they are obviously profiting off of this ? How should we think through this ? But before we get to that , I just want to know what do you think ? Do you think Adnan is guilty ? Do you think someone else murdered this girl ? <p> Russell Moore : We have had this debate , and for those of you who are listeners , we actually had a really intense debate over this here in our ERLC offices in Nashville a week ago and another one today in our Washington , D.C. , offices just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our team coming down where I would expect that they would come down on this . So , Dan , I think you , after listening to this all this time , you think Adnan is innocent . <p> Darling : I do . I absolutely do . <p> Moore : Okay . And why ? <p> Darling : I just think the states case is so flimsy . I think there is not any , you know , forensic evidence . I just think they are basing it onI mean the timeline is shaky . Jays testimony is shaky . I do n't  know . I am not saying Adnan is a guy I would want teaching my kids Sunday School , but <p> Moore : He gives his cell phone and his car to somebody else and then just disappears and does n't  remember where he was the entire day when his ex-girlfriend is murdered and then never calls her to check on her after she disappears ? They have a record that he did not try to call her pager or to check on her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean <p> Moore : He s clearly guilty . <p> Darling : Thats the strongest part of their case , to be honest with you . <p> Moore : That is the case ! <p> Darling : I mean , the one thing that really bothers meits just like I felt like there are leads that they did n't  pursue , or there are other angles . Like , for instance , you know , her existing boyfriendit seems like they did n't  <p> Moore : Her existing boyfriend has a solid alibi . He was at LensCrafters the whole day . <p> Darling : I justif it was me , and I was innocent , and they had that much little evidence actually , and they convicted me , I would just likethat would be bad <p> Moore : Well , but you are basing that on the evidence that they have that she is displaying in the Serial podcast . We do n't  know that that 's what the jury has . <p> Darling : Right . <p> Moore : It could beI mean they did convict him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more info . Now , what I would agree with you on is if I were sitting on a jury having to make this decision beyond a reasonable doubt , and all that was presented to me is what I have heard on this Serial podcast , which I 'm not assuming is what the jury heard , but if that was the case I would n't vote to convict based upon that amount of evidence . There are all sorts of situations where on a jury you can say I think somebodys guilty , just on the basis of circumstance and on the basis of intuition , but that does n't  mean that you vote to convict . <p> Darling : But the case is weak , yeah . And I think there 's a possibility that he is guilty but the case is weak . <p> Moore : Yeah , sure . <p> Darling : I mean , Im open to that . He is obviously the lead suspect . So , let 's get to the question of should Christian consciences be bothered by listening to this ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing this , taking a real story and serializing it for profit ? <p> Moore : Well , this has caused a little bit of controversy , not in the way that this questioner is asking . I thought it was a good question to raise because its not something that I 've heard anyone really grapple with previously . There has been some controversy over , for instance , Best Buy . For those of you who listen to Serial , part of the story is the question of the payphone at Best Buy . And they do n't  have any evidence that there ever was a payphone at Best Buy from which the telephone call was made after the murder . Best Buy tweeted , " Weve got everything you need this holiday season except a payphone . " <p> Darling : Yikes . <p> Moore : Yeah . And that was in very poor taste because I think Best Buy isI think whoever did this in the Best Buy organization is just assuming that this is a murder mystery in the way that its easy to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I talk about this caseI have a pastor friend in Alabama that I text back and forth with all the time after the new episode of Serial comes out as to whether or notwhat do you think ? My latest thing to him was to say I think this is going to end as a romance between Sarah Koenig and Adnan Syed because she seems to be really taken with him , so I just think its going to end with them breaking out of jail and going to Mexico . Its easy to look at this , and its almost like you are just watching a multipart drama without reminding yourself , no , this is a real murder that was taking place . A real human being was killed , and a real human being is imprisoned . And so , I think that 's where the problem came in with Best Buy trivializing this . Having said that , I do n't  think that there is an ethical problem with Sarah Koenig , with This American Life doing this broadcast , nor with Christians listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its true , as this questioner says , that they are turning a murder into at least in some way a commercial product . They are selling advertisements . MailChimp is on there every time . Maybe for this broadcast MailChimp will advertize on our podcast . We will wait and see . They are making some money off of this . That 's clear . But , its notI do n't  think that what 's happening here is exploiting the murder . I do n't  think that there is a glorification of the murder itself . I do n't  think that the podcast is trying to appeal to peoples baser instincts in terms of bloodlust . I mean , there are certain genres that do that . They come awfully close to what was happening with the gladiator games that our Christians forefathers said were morally wrong . I do n't  see any of that in here . There 's not a dwelling upon the darker aspects of this . I think instead what is happening is there 's a narrative that is being told that 's being walked through in order to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , in that , I actually think that there are some morally good things that are coming out in here . One of those is just the question of dealing with innocent people who are in prison . Now , again , I do n't  think Adnan Syed is an innocent person who is in prison , but I think having the podcast working with The Innocence Project and saying what are the sorts of things you look at . How is it that people can be convicted when innocent ? I think that 's a good and important issue to raise . Shining a light on it . <p> Darling : To me , that was one of the more helpful broadcasts when they talked to The Innocence Project and figured out kind of what they look like . To close , I think a good question would be what do you think podcasts like Serial and crime shows , what do you think it says about our desire to see justice in the world ? That seems like its a natural human desire , right ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see justice . I also think that there is a natural human desire to recognize what Proverbs says , which is , the one who justifies the wicked and the one who puts condemnation on the innocent , both are an abomination to God . Now , I think that is exactlythat intuition is there where you say that if you have people who are guilty of murder going free , there is something wrong about that . So , when we are listening to this podcast , we are likewe are sitting here thinking to ourselves who killed Hae ? because we know , even though we do n't  know her , most of us , we have never met her or even heard of her , something awful and morally wrong happened there , and there ought to be an accounting for that . And then on the other hand , there is this sense of people who are innocent should n't be in prison . So , you are thinking through . No ones thinking well , who cares if Adnan is innocent and he s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is in prison for the rest of his life , that 's morally wrong . So , I think there is that intuition which of course as Christians we believe is n't just about morality . Its also ultimately about the gospel because Proverbs uses that language , he who justifies the wicked is an abomination to God , and then turns around in Romans , chapter 3 and 4 , and talks about the God who does what ? justifies the wicked . So , how is God not an abomination to himself ? Thats Pauls argument is that in the cross he punishes sinevery sin is accounted for and punished . So he is both just and in the life of Christ , who is innocent before the tribunal of God and righteous before God , he is the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus .

@@100509479 @4709479/ <h> 3 ways to think biblically about Black Friday <p> My husband and I like traditions . Part of it is owing to my own familys love for all things familiar , but the other part is that we just enjoy doing fun things together . We like to celebrate , and like many Americans , we like Black Friday . <p> Yes , that is correct . We are some of the many crazy people who venture out on the biggest shopping day of the year . We scour the newspaper ads the day before , while watching the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade . We make our list and check it twice . And we love every minute of it . Before we had kids , we even got up at hours of the morning that no one should be awake just to find a deal . Now we wait until our kids get up to face the crowds ( although my husband is not opposed to going out by himself in the wee hours of the morning ) . But we still are avid Black Friday shoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm over Black Friday is owing to our interest in seeing what craziness is out there ( or in my husbands case , his love for a good deal ) . But the biggest reason we endure the crowds and the crazy is because there is nothing like being able to finish your Christmas shopping before December even arrives . <p> Avoid Black Friday ? <p> There are many reasons Christians might avoid Black Friday shopping . Perhaps the most compelling one is the rampant consumerism that seems to dominate all things Christmas in our culture . Black Friday has turned into Black Thursday , Black Wednesday , and Black All Night Long . Some even boycott stores that stay open on Thanksgiving , in protest of the perceived greed that drives many retail stores to forego the Thanksgiving break and get right into the Christmas spirit . <p> And I 'm with them on the problems of greed and consumerism . As Christians , we know that Christmas is about so much more than getting everything on our wish list , getting the best deal , and fighting with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ of Christmas puts to death the greed and consumerism that so easily entangles us this time of year . <p> Embrace Black Friday ? <p> But as one who enjoys partaking in a little Black Friday shopping , I hope to offer a different way to think about this day that does n't  involve boycotting , fighting for toys , or coveting what we can not have or can not afford . <p> Black Friday shopping can be a form of good stewardship . While my husband loves getting a good deal , his purpose in seeking deals is not for bargains sake . He wants to steward our money well . He knows we have been given a set amount of resources , and he wants to multiply those resources in a way that honors God and serves others . Black Friday shopping can serve this purpose as well . <p> Perhaps getting all of your shopping done early enables you to truly focus on the Christ of Christmas , this is good stewardship of time . Perhaps saving a few dollars on your Christmas presents affords you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend in need . This also is good stewardship of your finances . <p> Black Friday shopping can be a way to love your neighbor . Jesus commands us to love our neighbors as ourselves ( Matt. 22:39 , Mark 12:31 ) . Nowhere do we see overt self-love like we do on Black Friday . But , as Christians , we have the Holy Spirit , who enables us to respond differently to the frenetic pace of the holiday season . Black Friday gives us the opportunity to love our neighbor by treating those around us differently . When the pressure rises to fight for a new gaming console or push someone aside in frustration , we can die to our own selfish desires for the next big shiny thing . We can treat our neighbors like we would want to be treated , with love , kindness , and patience . <p> But we also can love our neighbor in a less obvious way this Black Friday . We can love our neighbor by buying stuff . Boycotting stores for their holiday practices only hurts the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs the most this Christmas . By heading out to stores with open wallets , we can love the workers by keeping them in business . <p> Black Friday shopping can encourage a healthy spirit of giving . All of us have been given an abundance from our heavenly Father . He delights in giving good gifts to his children ( Matt. 7:11 ) . He lavishes his kindness on us in Christ ( Eph. 1:7-9 ) . As image bearers , we get to experience a small ( and broken ) taste of this joy when we also give gifts to those we love ( 2 Cor. 9:7 ) . Because Black Friday can be a day of stewardship for Christians , it also can be a day where we have the resources to buy the gift our loved one so desperately wants or needs . <p> Black Friday shopping does n't  have to be all about greed and consumerism . It does n't  have to be about excessive spending and fights with people over the last flat screen television . It can be a time for Christians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and not of it .

@@100509480 @4709480/ <h> 3 keys to shaping your childrens view of marriage <p> There was a time when little boys and girls grew up and dreamed of getting married . It was a goal of most people in American society . I 'm not much of a nostalgic , take-America-back type of guy , but you do n't  have to be a sociologist to realize that marriage as an institution is changing . This means Christian parents must teach the next generation about marriage . We cant assume our children will automatically understand Gods creational design for men and women and why this venerable institution represents Christ and his Church . <p> While this is n't cause for fear or alarmism , but it does call for a redoubling of our efforts as parents toward what we should have been doing anyway . Here are three keys to remember : <p> 1 . We must teach our kids what marriage is . Every generation of parents must teach their children , from the Scriptures , exactly what marriage is and why it was created by God . We must pass down a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have imbibed some false views of marriage . The Human Rights Campaign offers a distorted view of marriage , and the bridal magazines offer another .

Angela and I have found that the best opportunity for these lessons are not only in family worship time , but in random teachable moments . <p> 2 . We must model for our kids exactly what marriage looks like . Part of the reason so many are disillusioned with marriage is because very few have actually seen , up close , what a good marriage looks like .

The danger in being intentional about teaching and modeling marriage is that we can raise up little finger-pointing , angry marriage Pharisees without realizing it . There are broken marriages and broken relationships all around us . Christians are not here to simply model the sexual ethics of the Kingdom , but to be on mission in the world , a world crushed by sexual and relational sin ( John 17 ) .

@@100509483 @4709483/ <h> The Church must respond to marijuana 's destructive march <p> Marijuana supporters continue to succeed with their plan to legalize this dangerous drug across the country . Their strategy is now quite obvious . They begin by playing on the publics compassion with medical marijuana , and then follow up with their true agenda : the widespread legalization of recreational marijuana . <p> A quick look at the 2014 vote results reveals this strategy very clearly . Oregon and Alaska , which both legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday , have had legal medical marijuana since 1998 . The medical marijuana efforts passed in those states because voters were told it would help relieve peoples suffering . Fast forward to 2014 , and they now have legal recreational marijuana . <p> Once a state legalizes medical marijuana , proponents know its just a matter of time until they can advance their real agenda . Apparently , it takes about 15 years to desensitize the public enough to the dangers of marijuana to achieve the next step toward full legalization . The other two states to legalize the recreational use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 1998 and Washington State did so in 2000 . Then , in 2012 , the two states legalized marijuana for recreational use . <p> The town of South Portland in Maine followed this path on Tuesday as well , voting to legalize recreational use of the drug . Maine legalized the medical use of marijuana in 1999 . The District of Columbia , which also legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday , is the outlier . The District legalized medical marijuana in 2010 , but given the extreme liberal disposition of the majority of the Districts voters , the more rapid fall is n't really surprising . <p> Tuesdays marijuana votes proved medical marijuanas status as the Trojan Horse of the marijuana legalization movement . No state has legalized recreational marijuana without first legalizing medical marijuana . The lesson for all the states is clear : if you legalize medical marijuana , its just a short matter of time before you will be contending with the likelihood of legal recreational marijuana . Floridas voters saved themselves from this fate on Tuesday when they rejected an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalization of medical and recreational marijuana , its safe to say that Florida has bought itself more time before it must deal with the question of legalized recreational marijuana . <p> With so much at stake , the church must respond . First , Christians must make sure they balance their compassion with discernment . While we want to do all we can to help people , we must see through what has become the obvious true goal of legalizers . Christians must not allow themselves to be used for an agenda that will result in thousands of destroyed lives . Marijuana is an addictive , mind-altering substance that is nearly impossible to use in moderate doses . It has been a gateway drug for millions of users . Making it more accessible will lead to more drug addiction and all the social costs associated with drug abuse . <p> Second , Christians must not allow themselves to be persuaded that marijuana is an acceptable medical remedy . Using marijuana exposes a person to multiple toxic compounds and serious personal negative repercussions . Marijuana puts the user at higher risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart attacks . It interferes with work and relationships . <p> Third , Christians must stay engaged in local debates and politics to help keep their communities as drug-free as possible . The path from medical marijuana to recreational marijuana does not have to be inevitable . California , which was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 , rejected the effort to legalize its recreational use in 2010 . The Maine town of Lewiston also rejected an effort to legalize the recreational use of marijuana on Tuesday . Neighbor love requires that we look out for our fellow citizens . We can help by resisting the deceptive messages of the marijuana purveyors and show up at the polls every time our state is asked to take the next step toward marijuanas legalization . <p> Finally , churches must engage their communities . Churches must continue to promote healthy lifestyles as a key to human flourishing for their own members as well as for the public in general . Drug abuse is not compatible with human flourishing . Christians can emphasize this by maintaining drug-free lifestyles themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal potential . In addition , churches should provide services that can help people in their communities overcome drug addiction and reclaim their lives . Jesus not only saves the soul ; He also restores broken lives .

The Bibles call to personal purity and sobriety has not changed . We must remain faithful to its call and not be deceived by the cultures call to personal indulgence . As a world steeped in confusion follows a path to destruction , Gods people should be like Daniel and his friends who chose a healthy lifestyle over the kings table .

@@100509485 @4709485/ <h> How not to read the news <p> We live in a time where we are exposed to more news headlines than at any time in human history . In the ancient days of news , anchors checked the AP newswire for stories and reported on them and people in their homes watched or people in their cars listened to radio . Today , everyone , is essentially checking the wire , all day , through social media . We also live in a time when its has never been easier to publicly express an opinion . Before the Internet , if something happened , you might have picked up the phone to call someone or perhaps you might discuss it at work , around the water cooler . But today we are all pundits , all with commentary on what is happening right now . <p> Quite often this new reality is leveraged for good . If a disaster strikes , more people can be informed than in previous generations . Social networks can be good conduits for raising money for important charity , for networking and communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new paradigm has flattened leadership , forcing organizations to be more transparent and less hierarchical . All this is good . <p> Still , followers of Christ need to think through how they process the news , particularly how we react to the headlines that come across our screens every day . Here are three tips I think that might help : <p> 1 . Do n't  react to headlines , get the full story . I think James 1:19 is instructive here . If I could paraphrase , I 'd say we should be " swift to hear , slow to tweet , slow to outrage . " We often get it backwards . Two things work against us slowing down and getting the story right : confirmation bias and our need to be the first and most clever to speak . First , because we can tailor our news intake ( more on that below ) to our specific point of view and bias , we tend to gravitate to news headlines that confirm what we already want to believe about people and personalities we might not favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the first to comment and to have the most clever reaction ( measured in retweets ) . There is an inherent danger in being so reactive to headlines . If you have not read the full story and , perhaps , ready other stories about the topic , a quick reaction can make you appear foolish . It also works to divide the body of Christ . There is nothing wrong with principled , sharp engagement with news stories . Christians need thoughtful commentary on cultural events , but we need it to be critiquing things that actually happened , not caricatures of things that happened . There 's a difference here . Before you start a brushfire online , before you email your allies with damning information about someone with whom you disagree , before you forward and post negative things , make sure you are actually getting the full story . <p> 2 . Do n't  consume news from only one point of view . Its a good habit to follow , on Twitter and in our other consumption of news , people from other " tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other ideological perspectives . Its good to have a mix of people in your twitter feed : advocates , opponents , and straight-up journalists . This gives you a much more nuanced view of what is actually going on . It also keeps you from tin-foil hat conspiracy theorists that seem to dominate on all sides of various issues . You should also have an operating principle of not reacting to a story unless you 've read two or three versions of it from diverse news outlets . In other words , do n't  just take the news story that best confirms what you already believe about something or someone . Get the full picture here . I can think of one story in particular that I thought was newsworthy , even worth commissioning an article for ERLC . But then I asked a few folks , read a few more articles , and realized there was more to it . <p> 3 . Try to see the human side of the news . This is especially important when news stories involve personalities , whether politicians or preachers . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger culture and in the church world ( unfortunately ) . Remember that the person you are about to destroy online with a clever hashtag probably has a family who can google their name . Do you want to be the one who caused their daughter pain ? Followers of Christ should operate by different principles . This should have two effects on our public witness : First , when expressing public disagreement , we are to consider every person , even those with whom we viscerally disagree , as people created in Gods image and worthy of respect ( James 3:9 ; 1 Pet . 2:17 ) . Were also supposed to be especially charitable to fellow Christians ( Gal . 6:10 ) . Secondly , to knowingly spread false witness about someone by not getting the facts right says to the world that we do n't  value some humans like we value others . Its also sin . All of us are wise to consider our platforms and how we are influencing those who follow us. 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174 
@@100509486 @4709486/ <h> Satan 's strategy to destroy your marriage before it begins <p> Tim and Jess had only been married for eight months , but the honeymoon was most certainly over . The sweet conversations that once marked their relationship had been replaced with constant bickering . Their laughter had dulled and their distance had grown . Their sexual intimacy had almost ceased . <p> What had gone wrong ? How had Satan slipped into this young couples marriage ? As we unpacked some of their history , I discovered that he had n't  sabotaged them on their honeymoon or in the early months of figuring out married life . Instead , hed begun his work before they even made it to the altar . You see , though Tim and Jess are Christians , their dating and engagement was marked with sexual impurity . <p> The early days of their relationship had been fine , but over time , they made consistent compromises that developed into a deeper pattern of sexual sin . When theyd sin , they confessed to each other and made oaths to not let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , they never truly let anyone else in on what was happening , and in hindsight they admitted that their courtship had been a big cover-up of deceit . <p> Unfortunately , Tim and Jesss story is all too familiar . Many unmarried Christian couples struggle with sexual sin . And this should be no surprise , we have an enemy who is set against us and set against our impending marriage ( 1 Pet . 5:8 ) . This enemy hates God and he hates marriage because marriage itself is a portrayal of the gospel ( Eph. 5:32 ) . Satan wants to do whatever he can to undermine marriage . <p> One of Satans most effective strategies to corrupt the gospel portraying union of marriage is to attack couples before they say " I do " through sexual sin . What follows are several of Satans most common ploys to attacking marriages before they begin . ( Eph. 6:11 ; 1 Pet . 5:8 ) <p> 1 . Satan wants us to make a pattern of obeying our desires instead of Gods direction . <p> Gods ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not . This has been his plan from the first call to compromise in the Garden of Eden ( Gen. 3:1-6 ) . His end goal is for us to develop a consistent pattern of resisting the Spirit and following our sinful desires once we get into marriage . He wants us to learn to resist service and to pursue selfishness . <p> If we learn to do what we want to do when we want to do it before we get married , well carry that pattern into the days that follow our wedding . This is deadly because service and sacrifice is essential to a healthy , Christ-honoring marriage . Love in marriage is shown by a thousand daily decisions to do the dishes when you do n't  want to or change a diaper when you do n't  want to or watch a movie instead of a basketball game . If your relationship before marriage is characterized by giving into urges of the immediate desire , you 'll most certainly struggle when you get into the nitty-gritty of married life . <p> 2 . Satan wants us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants us to think that we wont take our sin to the next level . He wants us to think that were stronger than we really are . He wants to make us think that well never go " that far . " This is a powerful trick because it plays upon our well-intended desire to honor God and our pride at the same time . Trust me , you 're weaker than you think you are . You can go where you think you wo n't go . Sin is like an undercurrent in the ocean , if you play in it , you will be overpowered and carried away into certain destruction . <p> One of the ways Satan works this angle is to tempt you to think that purity is a line rather than a posture of the heart . He wants you to think that purity before God is not kissing or not taking off clothes or not having oral sex or not " going all the way . " He wants you to think that if you do n't  cross a certain line , you 're " staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Jesus says if we lust in our heart , we 've sinned and are condemned before God ( Matt. 5:27-30 ) . <p> Purity is much more about the posture of our heart than about the position of our body . The age old question of " how far is too far " may be revealing a desire to get as close to sin as possible rather than a desire to " flee " as God calls us to ( 1 Cor. 6:18 ) . So I ask you , what 's the posture of your heart ? Are you seeking to find ways to flee from lust or getting as close as you can ? Be careful to not underestimate your vulnerability , or as Paul said , " let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall " ( 1 Cor. 10:12 ) . <p> 3 . Satan wants couples to weaken their trust for each other . <p> When we compromise sexually were showing the other person that were willing to use and abuse them to get what makes you happy . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other into sin we are communicating , even though we do n't  mean to , " you cant trust me because I 'm willing to use you and disregard you to get what I want . " <p> And even worse than that , we show that we care more about our desires than about what God wants from us. 1 Thessalonians 4:3 says " this is the will of God , your sanctification : that you abstain from sexual immorality . " And verse eight says , " whoever disregards this , disregards not man but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you . " So when you sin sexually against each other before marriage you are saying , " You cant trust me because I 'm willing to sacrifice both of our relationships with God to do what I want . " <p> This is certainly one of the most deadly of all his strategies and the one I suspect hurt Tim and Jess the most . They did n't  trust each other . They never really did . So much of their dating relationship was wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never developed a deep mature battle-tested trust for each other . <p> It is important to point out however that when we resist sexual sin , God blesses a relationship with the exact opposite effect . Every time we say " no " to sexual sin and turn to prayer and tell each other that we value them and their walk with God too much to go one step further , God uses that to strengthen trust between couples . My wife regularly tells dating couples that one of the reasons she trusts me is because I literally ran from compromising situations before we were married . We werent perfect in our courtship , but the Lord used that season to build trust in each other . <p> 4 . Satan wants to deceive you with the forbidden fruit of lust . <p> There is a world of difference between pre-marital sex and sex within marriage . One of the reasons for this is that in pre-marital sex the forbidden fruit of lust portrays sex as something that it is n't always in marriage . Most normally , pre-marital sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , the feelings are intense , and the drive to go further is fueled by the fact that you know you should n't ( Rom. 7:8 ) . <p> Sex in marriage is different . There 's still passion and there 's still intense feelings and emotionsbut sex in marriage is based primarily on the hot coals of trust , devotion , and sacrifice ( 1 Cor. 7:1-5 ) . Couples who built their sexual expectations on the passion that the forbidden fruit provided are often disappointed and confused about why sex is so different in marriage . <p> Now , to be candid , my wife and I laughed at this idea when our pre-marital counselor told us . We were sure that we were gon na be the exception to the rule . But the reality is , that almost six years and three children later , he was right . Couples like us can have a strong sex life , but it is fueled by deeper characteristics than fleeting passion . Satan wants couples to get used to running on the caffeine and sugar of lust rather than mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts <p> Wait in Faith . The Christian posture is always one of waiting . We wait for Christs return . We wait for an eternity with him . And people who are n't  married wait for the blessings of marriage . Say no to sins promises by faith in Gods promises . Renew your mind with Gods Word and keep waiting in faith . <p> Dude , you 've got ta lead . While both people in the relationship are responsible before God , the man in the relationship must set the pace for purity . Too often our ladies are forced to draw lines and say no . That 's just wrong and cowardly . Its the dudes responsibility to care for his future wife by leading her toward Jesus and away from sinand not into the darkness and pain of evil . If he sets the wrong pattern here , hell be digging out for years afterwardand may never regain the ground he loses apart from Gods grace . <p> Involve others every step of the way . Do n't  allow your relationship to remain unexamined by other godly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faithful friends who keep you accountable . Encourage them to ask you tough questions and always give honest answers . God uses transparency to give spiritual strength . <p> If you sin , go to the gospel . does sin , we have one who speaks to the Father in our defenseJesus Christ , the righteous One " ( 1 John 2:1-2 ) . If you sin , flee to the cross . Flee to the empty tomb . Look to Christ , confess your sin deeply , and repent . God blesses this kind of posture ( Prov. 28:13 ) . <p> Sexual sin does n't  need to be dagger in the heart of your courting relationship , engagement or marriage . God is a merciful God who delights in restoring what sin seeks to destroy ( Joel 2:25-2 ) . He will not however bless on-going disobedience and presumption upon his mercy .

But consider that 50 percent of the app users are 13 to 17 , according to USA Today . According to another survey conducted this year , 54 percent in that age group send or receive sexually explicit images or texts . <p> Whether these images are ever released or not , The Snappening is a perfect prompt for parents to talk to their kids . If your teen is caught sexting , there could be legal ramifications as well as significant reputational and emotional damage . And , science says that a youth involved in sexting is at greater risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Talk to your teens <p> Its time to talk . But do n't  expect the conversation to be easy . <p> The Snappening is happening on the heels of The Fappening , a leak of hundreds of photos of celebrities and A-listers that did get posted publicly . Among them , Jennifer Lawrence , who defended her nude selfies by saying , " Either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he is going to look at you . " That kind of response is only going to normalize sexting as teens conform to the standard of the world in an effort to desperately control their sexual lives and relationships . Here are a few things you should cover in the conversation . <p> 1 . Ask your tween or teen point blank if they have ever sent or received a nude photo or sexually explicit text . The fact is , our kids do n't  report this one at the dinner table . Many of them may feel bullied or victimized but experience insecurity about how to ask for help . Be the parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to ask them if they 've had sex or oral sex or anything kind of like it . ( Did I mention this wasnt going to be easy ? ) Determine the level of risk and seek help accordingly . <p> 2 . Talk to them about the idea of consequence and permanence . If they understood these things , theyd be adults . Do n't  let them fool you into thinking they are . The prefrontal cortex of their brains , which controls executive functionthat is , self control and awareness of riskisnt fully developed until they are in their early twenties . If they thought many people would see the photo or there could be legal consequences , they would n't have participated in sexting . The fact is : they did n't  think . Its your job to help them . <p> 3 . Explain that anyone who is caught with a nude photo of a minor on their phone is at risk of uncertain legal consequences that wo n't quickly go away . Last week , 30 high school students who were found with sexually explicit photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently laws on the books about sexting . They may be going to court to fight serious felony charges that could land them on the sex offender registry . While laws differ from state to state , we simply do n't  have a plan in place to deal with children under the age of 18 who contribute to what is , in fact , child pornography . <p> 4 . Discuss the reputational and emotional risk . Jennifer Lawrence emerged rather gracefully as something of a spokesperson for other victims . Uncertain of how the photos would affect her career , she considered the leak to be " a sex crime " and a " sexual violation . " These are powerful words that reveal the emotional turmoil the twenty-four-year old felt , but Lawrence has a fully developed mind and body and an established career . What kind of impact would it have on a much younger student who is not as confident in their life direction ? You wont have to dig deeply on the Internet to find many stories of teens who commit suicide in similar circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics . Sex is a gift to be shared between a man and wife within the context of marriage . Tell them this often from the age of nine or ten until they are married . Otherwise , the world will tell them quite loudly and quite often . ( Case in point : Jennifer Lawrence . ) <p> The Hebrew word for sex in the Old Testament is yada , which means " to know , to be known , to be deeply respected . " You cant know or be known by the pixels on your screen . God created the act of sex to bring one man and one woman into a mutually exclusive act of intimacy that is fueled with respect and commitment . Sexting is one of the most disrespectful activities that exists and does n't  protect the exclusive intimacy of sexuality . It is a cheap counterfeit .

@@100509492 @4709492/ <h> Simple ways your church can keep and reach Millennials <p> It seems that everywhere we look in the pop Christian blogosphere , someone is talking about Millennials . The conversation is usually focused on what these Millennials want and how the local church can reach them . <p> For example , in a September article on their website , Barna Research Group offered new survey findings to produce " 5 Ways to Connect with Millennials . " As a pastor of a church that reaches over 1,000 Millennials each Sunday , I personally believe the vast conversation focused on Millennials is a little overblown . It has become more of a content-generating selling point than actually helping us come any closer to reaching Millennials . <p> Two issues were facing <p> My suggestion is that we not make this generation so complicated . There are some simple truths we need to understand about the Church and Millennials , but once we know them , we should not overcomplicate how Millennials are reached and connected to the local Church . <p> There are two glaring issues the Church is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep those Millennials who are in the Church . <p> 2 . We need to reach the ones who are not . <p> Worldview is key to keeping Millennials <p> The Great Commission calls us to both of these important aspects of Christian mission : evangelism and discipleship . Figuring out how to answer this call for Millennials should not be any different , and I do not think we need yet another study , book , or conference . Starting with Sundays , the simple fact is that many churches have services and programs that people do n't want to attend , especially a generation with ever-decreasing loyalties . It is n't worth peoples time or energy to come to a Sunday morning service that is , in their eyes , lame , cheesy and awkward . Millennials are also obsessed with an " experience , " and they are n't getting that at most churches . While I 'm not suggesting we create consumer cultures or even more " attractional " models , I am claiming we need to make Sundays worth the drive and time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Millennials in their gatherings , and it has everything to do with worldview . The Barna article states , <p> " Millennials need help learning how to apply their hearts and minds to today 's cultural realities . Millennials need guidance on engaging culture meaningfully , and from a distinctly Christian perspective . " <p> Barna concludes from research that Millennial Christians are more than twice as likely to say their church helped them learn " about how Christians can positively contribute to society " compared to those who drop out of church ( 46 percent versus 20 percent ) . The conclusion of that research is obviously important , but that is far from the biggest issue . As this generation grows increasingly progressive , we are seeing a decline in their confidence in the Scriptures , beginning with the exclusive belief that Jesus Christ alone is the way to salvation , along with other essential Biblical truths . The Church must teach convictional confidence in the Scriptures in order to keep Millennial Christians and help them develop a Biblical worldview . <p> So while many want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not sure we ever had them in the first place . For many Millennials , views on faith and church were shaped by or inherited from their parents and grandparents . When you 've been part of a church for years out of family obligation , image , or tradition , that shelf life will eventually expire . Keeping Millennials in the Church might begin with actually helping them move from a cultural faith of heritage to a convictional belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ . We must create environments , reason from the Scriptures , and help this generation see why the local church matters . <p> Reaching Millennials requires non-Christian relationships <p> We must also understand the different challenges between keeping Millennials in the Church , and reaching those who have yet to come . Changing your service style and increasing confidence in the Scriptures can help you keep Millennials , but it wo n't help you reach them . <p> You have a band ? So does the local bar in town . <p> You serve coffee ? So does the place they frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is that people of all generations come to church on the arm of a trusted friend . So why isnt the Church reaching Millennials ? I think the answer is actually simple , but rarely discussed . Christian Millennials largely do not have relationships with non-believers . <p> If one asked what the greatest hindrance to the Great Commission in America is today , likely answers would be militant secularism , religious liberty , rapidly vanishing Christian influence in the public square , and the rise of the " nones . " These would all qualify as urgent matters the Church is facing and must be addressing . However , I believe the biggest hindrance to the advancement of the Church , especially within this Millennial generation , is the bubble of the Christian subculture . <p> The hindrance of two Christian subcultures <p> Today , the subculture is represented by two types of Millennial Christians . One group I am going to call the " Savvy Millennials " ( SMs ) . They use buzzwords , such as " authentic " and " transparent , " while modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian . They dress in the latest trends , love bands that have n't been discovered by the mainstream and have no problem spending their Friday evening sipping wine at the local hot spot . " Cultural engagement " is the name of their game , and this generation of Christians plays it with pride . Putting on the latest threads from Urban Outfitters , these SMs head out to a concert or a bar for the night , posting pictures later that display newfound freedom from their separatist forefathers . To SMs , this lifestyle is sometimes even considered being on mission as they take part in the culture around them . <p> Yet , I continue to find myself asking this perplexing question : If a generation of Christians is so missional , authentic , and culturally engaged , then why do we face the dilemma of a missing generation in the Church ? While only God can open the eyes of ones heart to the gospel , something still does n't add up . Yes , there is a major absence of Christians who simply are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe there is a larger issue in this missing generation being unreached . Many Christians who profess to be culturally engaged and missional are really not either of those . <p> The Savvy Millennials love a good social justice cause but are often indifferent to the Great Commission . They love to be as cool as the world and join in on some the fun , but the dirty little secret is that they are doing this with their Christian friends and not the lost . Without even realizing it or admitting it , the SMs are in the center of Christian bubble they love to hate . In reality this cool crew has no more interaction with non-Christians than their culturally removed ancestors they are trying so hard to distance themselves from . <p> There is another group within the Christian subculture bubble that is n't as hip or trendy , but they are very engaged . . . online . . . with each other . We will call these folks the " Gospel Centered Millennials " ( GCMs ) . They critique books , listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions of " missional " and " cultural engagement . " Social media is big within this camp . It allows them to link articles and quote the gospel definitions of their heroes . They talk and write about evangelism and will share their faith as a cold call next to the person on an airplane . While any evangelism is better than no evangelism , you wo n't find this group actually building relationships with non-Christians . In other words , you wo n't find them being missional , you 'll just find them talking about it . <p> Theologically , this camp is orthodox and , thankfully , unashamed of the gospel . Unfortunately , the gospel message they possess does not reach being on mission frequently enough in the day-to-day of their lives . They will go preach to hundreds in unreached countries but have never engaged with the lost through relationships in their own city . They are separatists without even realizing it because they are n't  aware that the conversations they are having about gospel and mission are actually not linking gospel with mission . GCMs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian sub-culture and seem to know more about their favorite blogger than their own neighbor . It seems this group never gets questioned , due to appreciation for their gospel convictions . While I do affirm those convictions strongly , any conversation about effectively reaching Millennials has to critique this tribe and their practice of commenting on culture without engaging in relationships . <p> The solution is in merging subcultures <p> What is the solution for Christians to move beyond the subculture bubble and reach lost people ? I believe it is a full blending of the best practices of each of these types of Millennial Christians . If the culturally aware practices of the Savvy Millennials could be merged with the theological convictions of the Gospel Centered Millennials , I believe it would inevitably lead to a localized fulfillment of the Great Commission . If an everlasting truth was taken to an ever-changing culture , if cultural engagement accompanied a proper gospel proclamation , then Millennials would be reached for Christ and connected to local churches . <p> Eating with tax collectors and sinners still works . Those coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only works if the culture is actually , well , engaged . This is difficult to accomplish when the SM thinks the mission of the Church is to make it " cooler " and uphold social justice , while the GCM makes theological dialogue and gospel policing the mission . <p> Christianity will never be made cool in a society that thinks we are nuts . We need theological vigor that leads to relational urgency with those who do not know Christ . We must be able to explain , reason , apply and model the message of Christ . I 've never met someone who came to Christ because they thought a Christian had great taste in skinny jeans and obscure folk rock bands . I 've also never met someone who came to Christ because a friend can make the case for elder rule in Church government . I am not trying to set up false dichotomies but rather stating that if a generation is going be reached , we must actually try to reach them and actually reach them to something . The SM must be challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be like the culture . The GCM must put feet to their tweets and blog posts about being gospel centered and on mission . <p> I 've learned that people who are actually gospel centered and " on mission " do n't really talk and tweet about it . They just do it . It is an intentional and purposeful lifestyle . They are unashamed of the message of Christ and live life along those who need Christ . Its that simple : have friends , and open your mouth about the gospelthat 's how you reach Millennials.

@@100509494 @4709494/ <h> 6th Circuit delivers a win for citizens to define marriage <p> Late this afternoon , the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rights of citizens to define marriage in Kentucky , Tennessee , Michigan , and Ohio . <p> In a 2-1 ruling , Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook bucked national trends , siding with citizens and their rightful constitutional authority to define marriage . <p> I want to spare readers the thick legal arguments made and highlight a few relevant portions of the ruling that assert the validity of state marriage laws that define marriage as the union of a man and woman . At a time when most justices write marriage opinions with rhetorical flourishes , Sutton and Cook demonstrated great judicial restraint , which is commendable . As they note in the very opening of their opinion , the question before the court is about " changeand how best to handle it under the United States Constitution . " <p> A few relevant portions of their ruling : <p> Of all the ways to resolve this question , one option is not available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for that matter all federal judges , about whether gay marriage is a good idea . Our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority , one that would allow just three of usjust two of us in truthto make such a vital policy call for the thirty-two million citizens who live within the four States of the Sixth Circuit : Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio , and Tennessee . What we have authority to decide instead is a legal question : Does the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a State from defining marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman ? ( 8 ) <p> What may be the most assuring portion of the ruling comes on pages 19-20 : <p> A dose of humility makes us hesitant to condemn as unconstitutionally irrational a view of marriage shared not long ago by every society in the world , shared by most , if not all , of our ancestors , and shared still today by a significant number of the States . Hesitant , yes ; but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the definition . What is it ? Two at a minimum suffice to meet this low bar . One starts from the premise that governments got into the business of defining marriage , and remain in the business of defining marriage , not to regulate love but to regulate sex , most especially the intended and unintended effects of male-female intercourse . Imagine a society without marriage . It does not take long to envision problems that might result from an absence of rules about how to handle the natural effects of male-female intercourse : children . May men and women follow their procreative urges wherever they take them ? Who is responsible for the children that result ? How many mates may an individual have ? How does one decide which set of mates is responsible for which set of children ? That we rarely think about these questions nowadays shows only how far we have come and how relatively stable our society is , not that States have no explanation for creating such rules in the first place . <p> Once one accepts a need to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create stable family units for the planned and unplanned creation of children , one can well appreciate why the citizenry would think that a reasonable first concern of any society is the need to regulate male-female relationships and the unique procreative possibilities of them . One way to pursue this objective is to encourage couples to enter lasting relationships through subsidies and other benefits and to discourage them from ending such relationships through these and other means . People may not need the governments encouragement to have sex . And they may not need the governments encouragement to propagate the species . But they may well need the governments encouragement to create and maintain stable relationships within which children may flourish . It is not societys laws or for that matter any one religions laws , but natures laws ( that men and women complement each other biologically ) , that created the policy imperative . And governments typically are not second-guessed under the Constitution for prioritizing how they tackle such issues . Dandridge v. Williams , 397 U.S. 471 , 48687 ( 1970 ) . <p> Sutton and Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws : <p> By creating a status ( marriage ) and by subsidizing it ( e.g. , with tax-filing privileges and deductions ) , the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring . That does not convict the States of irrationality , only of awareness of the biological reality that couples of the same sex do not have children in the same way as couples of opposite sexes and that couples of the same sex do not run the risk of unintended offspring . That explanation , still relevant today , suffices to allow the States to retain authority over an issue they have regulated from the beginning . ( 21 ) <p> <p> How can we say that the voters acted irrationally for sticking with the seen benefits of thousands of years of adherence to the traditional definition of marriage in the face of one year of experience with a new definition of marriage ? A State still assessing how this has worked , whether in 2004 or 2014 , is not showing irrationality , just a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition has worked elsewhere . Even today , the only thing anyone knows for sure about the long-term impact of redefining marriage is that they do not know . A Burkean sense of caution does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment , least of all when measured by a timeline less than a dozen years long and when assessed by a system of government designed to foster step-by-step , not sudden winner-take-all , innovations to policy problems . ( 21 ) <p> On page 23 , the justices expose a glaring inconsistency in the argument about whether to redefine marriage , namely whether the definition of same-sex marriage that 's advanced by activists holds up to its own logical coherence . The justices believe it does not . <p> If it is constitutionally irrational to stand by the man-woman definition of marriage , it must be constitutionally irrational to stand by the monogamous definition of marriage . Plaintiffs have no answer to the point . What they might say they can not : They might say that tradition or community mores provide a rational basis for States to stand by the monogamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that is exactly what they claim is illegitimate about the States male-female definition of marriage . The predicament does not end there . No State is free of marriage policies that go too far in some directions and not far enough in others , making all of them vulnerableif the claimants theory of rational basis review prevails . ( 23 ) <p> This is a sturdy ruling , one that deserves to be read for its willingness to inject logical argument into the question about marriages definition . This decision reaffirms what may be the most overlooked principle in the question about redefining marriage : No situation experienced by same-sex couples necessitates the redefinition of marriage . All of the situations that supposedly demand redefinition can be remedied apart from redefinition . That 's the purpose of public policy , which is to address some citizens needs in an equitable manner that does justice to other citizens and their constitutional rights to make policy . <p> While the outcome of todays ruling will likely result in an eventual ruling from the Supreme Court , those concerned about the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about marriage and the authority to make marriage policy in their states . <p> They end on a call to act and do what is it that citizens in a free country do : To settle issues as citizens . <p> In just eleven years , nineteen States and a conspicuous District , accounting for nearly forty-five percent of the population , have exercised their sovereign powers to expand a definition of marriage that until recently was universally followed going back to the earliest days of human history . That is a difficult timeline to criticize as unworthy of further debate and voting . When the courts do not let the people resolve new social issues like this one , they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in these change events are judges and lawyers . Better in this instance , we think , to allow change through the customary political processes , in which the people , gay and straight alike , become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington , D.C. has excellent analysis of the overall arguments available at National Review , which I commend . 43169 @qwx903169 43181 @qwx903181 43187 @qwx903187 43178 @qwx903178

" - Diana Schaub , National Affairs <p> Baseball is uniquely a sport that fathers pass on to their children . <p> When Willie Mays speaks of his dad teaching him how to walk when he was 6-months old by enticing him with a rolling baseball , he is telling the story of baseball . Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman tells how his CPA father took a late lunch every single day so he could throw him batting practice after school . After 16 years in the big leagues , Chipper Jones headed home and had his mom video his swing so his dad could help him rebuild it . In historian Doris Kearns Goodwins memoir Wait Till Next Year , she explains the formative role her fathers love of baseball had on her life and career pursuits , " By the time I had mastered the art of scorekeeping , a lasting bond had been forged among my father , baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers progress provided my first lessons in the narrative art . " <p> A game that 's taught , not caught <p> No child will love and pass down the game of baseball simply because someone bought him a glove , ball and bat . He can not play catch with himself , hit himself ground balls or throw himself batting practice . No child will figure out on their own what in the world a suicide squeeze , sacrifice , infield fly , frozen rope , Texas leaguer or balk means . The mechanics , mystery , nuance and jargon of baseball demand that one has to be personally discipled in its craft and patiently taught its glories . A baseball scorebook resembles mysterious hieroglyphics until the signs and symbols are patiently given meaning by a learned tutor . Very little in baseball is seeker-friendly or self-evident , and few people pick up the game on their own . <p> Almost no one ever develops a passionate love for baseball as an adult ( my wife being a glorious exception ) . That is not the way the game works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passed on through generations like a treasured family heirloom . Baseball demands the daily attentiveness of its zealous followers in a consistent and rhythmic sort of way . When columnist Thomas Boswell asserts , " Conversation is the blood of baseball , " he is describing the warp and woof of its distinctiveness ( How Life Imitates the World Series ) . As famed Orioles manager Earl Weaver once quipped , " This ai n't  football . We do this every day . " Football and basketball are sports of athleticism and can be peer oriented , but baseball uniquely remains a sport of persistence and usually demands a fathers involvement and investment . In almost every case when a Major League Baseball player is asked , " How did you develop a love for the game ? " his first words are , " My dad . " <p> My passion and love for the game began with my dad placing a baseball in my crib . It grew with countless conversations and times of catch , ground balls and batting practice with my father . The makeshift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little Dixie Youth Baseball Park , Joe Marshall Field in Montgomery , Ala. , will always be more sacred to me than Fenway or any other big league park . As we picked up balls after another round batting practice , the conversations between father and son helped usher me from boyhood to manhood . <p> Losing our American pastime <p> But I write this post with a fear that we are losing the great game . I do not mean losing at the turnstile , but we are losing what has always made the game enduring and great . I fear we are losing what has made the game of baseball so much more than " just a game " in our national ethos . <p> George Will explains , " Baseball , it is said , is only a game . True . And the Grand Canyon is only a hole in Arizona . " Jon Meacham asserts , " To wave off baseball as just a game is like referring to the global events of 1939-1945 as just a war. " These serious cultural thinkers understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850s , has been the quintessentially American game and a significant culture reflecting and shaping institution . Branch Rickey wrote in The American Diamond , " It is almost impossible to find any team sport that so critically and clearly tests the mettle of each man alone on almost every play and yet fuses them all together into a group working in team competition . That is the paradox of this game that makes it so well suited to the American temperament . " <p> Baseball requires a kind of individual moral courage that keeps persisting for the good of the team in the face of inevitable repeated personal failures . The national game reflected the national character in a way that uniquely embedded it in the American family experience . Fathers naturally related the daily and rhythmic narrative of baseball to the narrative of life as they reared children . <p> Absentee fathers and cultural decline <p> But , I fear baseball is becoming " just a game " in the American experience because fatherhood is in decline . The youth baseball experience is being abstracted from the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the cultural decline of baseball as the national pastime in America . But it must be noted that there are varying kinds of absentee fathers . Some tragically do not live in the home with their children , but others are in the home but hire or farm out much of the parenting . Even in Christian families , providing stuff and paying for opportunities is often counted as engaged parental involvement because we have lost a theology of presence . <p> The emergence of baseball academies , specialized paid instructors , and travel baseball teams is a symptom of a larger cultural problem . All of these opportunities can be helpful and have a place as a supplement to a players baseball development , but they too often become substitutes for what has made the game of baseball great and deeply entrenched in American culture . <p> Every time I see a father fiddling with his iPhone while paying another man $40 an hour to sit a ball on a tee or soft toss for his son , I realize we are losing the game . Baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have linked generations with a connectedness and shared language . The familial rootedness of baseball contributed to its emergence as the national pastime , and the hectic , virtual world we inhabit today makes its value largely unintelligible . Our industrialized , mass production culture has led to an unthinking value of quick , cheap , and disposable over slow , valuable , and lasting . The downgrade is evident in the range of American performing artsincluding sport . <p> Severing baseball from fathers and local communities is turning the great game into " just a game . " Any American father can be privy to a wealth of resources in books and on the Internet about the fundamentals of baseball that is unparalleled in history . With minimal effort , he can learn drills and patiently work with his son on a daily basis to learn and develop the needed skills . But , it seems many dads would rather pay $40 and be an absentee dad for the instructional hour . <p> After all , the baseball academies and instructors dangle the possibility of obtaining a college scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their professional lessons . Baseballs value is corrupted when it is simply seen as a possible means to some utilitarian end . Such notions are fantasy any way . Only two percent of High School baseball players receive any scholarship money to play baseball in college . A familys time would be more wisely invested by trying to hit it big in the lottery ( which I do not recommend ) . <p> A fathers presence and the gospel <p> Absentee dads , whether physically absent or emotionally absent , will not hand down a love and passion for baseball . A father who refuses to take the time to teach a game like baseball that demands patience will probably not take time for other complex and mysterious things eitherfar more important things . <p> It is not just baseball that demands a fathers presence . The good news of Jesus Christ is a simple yet infinitely profound message . The Bible takes us through the most important story in the history of the cosmos . The biblical gospel story has all kinds of twists and turns , nuances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:26-27 ) . It is the story that defines every one of our personal stories . Passing on " the faith once for all delivered to the saints " ( Jude 3 ) to the next generation takes time , patience , and never-ending conversations ( Deut. 6:4-9 ; Psalm 78:1-8 ) about " the mystery of the gospel " ( Eph. 6:19 ) . <p> Just like the dad dropping his son off with the baseball professionals , too many Christian fathers act as if they do not have time to read the long complex story of the Bible and have countless conversations with their children about the gospel and biblical truth . It is much easier and efficient to drop them off and allow the professionals at the church with seminary degrees to take care of serious religious stuff . Too many dads think what really matters is paying for their children to have the best opportunities and college one day . They tend to prefer the gospel tract approach to teaching faith and life , just the facts , hopefully get them saved , and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in a faith with a Savior who took on human flesh and dwelt among us , we ought to know better . Faithfully teaching our children about the glory of the incarnate , crucified , and resurrected Christ demands time , patience , and presence . <p> Without fathers , there is no baseballand unfortunately , that is one of the smallest tragedies of absentee dads . There is a reason grown men have often cried when Field of Dreams ends with Ray playing catch with his dad . But I fear we are heading toward a time when many men will be unmoved and puzzled by what they see as a strange ending to the movie .

@@100509496 @4709496/ <h> The solution to domestic violence in the NFL <p> Multiple domestic violence cases in the NFL in the past few weeks have caused outrage in the media , throughout the league , and among the fan base . Many fans and media outlets appear to be just as outraged by the way the Commissioner initially handled the earliest reports of the recent domestic violence cases . Consequently , the Commissioners critics continue to call for his resignation , which he currently refuses to give . <p> Far too many women suffer from domestic violence regardless of their race , social status , or geographic location . Growing up as a child , I witnessed my mother in my early pre-teenage years suffer domestic violence at the hands of her husbandwho was not my father . I witnessed firsthand the ugliness of this gross sin and the emotional trauma that it causes a child . However , I also know very well that the fundamental solution to the sin of domestic violence , which is not limited to the NFL , is not merely policies , procedures , training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , just as any form of discrimination and injustice , is the gospel of Jesus Christ . <p> As I saw my mom beaten by her husband , there was no law or policy that could make his spiritually dead heart want to stop kicking her in the head after he threw her on the ground , or from smacking her in the face , or from hitting her till she was severely bruised . Even when people in my family came to my mothers rescue with violent threats and defensive actions against this coward of a man , he eventually returned to his violent actions against her after protective family members were no longer a threat to him . The only solution to his cowardice , to his rage , to his violence , and to his sin against my mom was the transforming power of the gospela gospel which this man did not personally embrace and obey . <p> And the gospel of Jesus Christ is the real solution to the problem of domestic violence in the NFL . <p> As I listen to and watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this domestic violence , I have heard very few offer ridiculous excuses for the players ( e.g. bad social environment , difficult home life , etc . ) . However , I have heard both unhelpful and helpful solutions to rectifying this problem within the league . I have not yet heard anyone on ESPN or in the mainstream media offer the gospel of Jesus Christ as the solution to this egregious problem . <p> Regardless of how much money NFL football players make , how famous they are , how difficult their childhoods were , and how much God-given talent they have , we must remember that they all are totally depraved sinners and guilty before God because of their sin , just as every other son and daughter of Adam and Eve . Many of these men are simply spoiled , violent , entitled , and self-worshipping idolaters , just as Adam , Eve , and their descendants ( e.g. Gen. 3:1-7 ; 4:8 ) . And many of them overtly practice the sins within their own hearts by doing what is right in their own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:1-10 ) . <p> As a result , these men do not fundamentally need rehabilitation or parental or marital classesalthough these things can be helpfulas though these actions will by themselves change the evil within their violent hearts and that shows itself via their violent actions toward women . Instead , they need to hear , believe and be transformed by the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ . They need to hear and respond by faith to the gospel message that a Jewish Messiah violently suffered the wrath of God on the cross and resurrected from the dead for sinners who were alienated from God and one another so that those same sinners would be peacefully reconciled to God and one another by faith in Jesus Christ ( Eph. 2:11-22 ) . <p> These men need to repent of their sins , embrace Jesus Christ as Lord by faith , and seek to live in faithful obedience to him in their social interaction with the women in their lives . <p> The reason some of these men in the NFL beat their wives , beat their girlfriends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fundamentally because of their race , their society , or their environment , but rather because of the spiritual deadness of their own hearts ( Eph. 2:1-10 ) . <p> Yes , ones environment affects how one acts , but sin makes ones environment sinful . The gospel can radically transform these men . If the gospel can transform a violent persecutor of the church like Saul of Tarsus into the greatest missionary in the history of Christianity ( Acts 7:58-8:3 ; 9:1-31 ; Gal . 1:12-16 ) , it can transform an unregenerate domestic violence offender in any sports league . <p> To clarify , my point is not that the NFL is filled with domestic violent offenders . There are many good men in the league ( e.g. Peyton Manning ) . Furthermore , my point is neither that only Christian NFL players are law-abiding citizens . There are non-Christian players who love their wives and their kids . And my point is not that ones embrace of the gospel will automatically result in peaceful relations with ones wife . Christians fail daily to love their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have even sinfully committed domestic violence against their wives . <p> The point that I 'm accentuating is that the gospel of Jesus Christ will transform the human heart that is dead in sin . <p> It provides the solution to the problem of sin and the provision for how sinners can be saved from Gods wrath ( Rom. 1:16-17 ; 3:21-4:25 ; 5:6-10 ) . It will supernaturally enable Christians to pursue love , joy , patience , kindness , gentleness , faithfulness , and self-control ( Gal . 5:22-23 ) and put away enmity , strife , and fits of anger ( Gal . 5:19 ) . By the Spirit , it will enable Christians to avoid the unfruitful works of darkness ( Eph. 5:10 ) , one of which is domestic-violence . <p> I hope the NFL will quickly take the appropriate actions to rid its league of domestic violence offenders . In addition , I hope that the league will take the measures to allow their Christian chaplains to have even more freedom to preach boldly and freely the gospel of Jesus Christ to these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love and follow Jesus and to love their wives as Christ loves his church ( Eph. 5:21-33 ) . And I hope that gospel-believing players , coaches , and owners will use the horrible reality of domestic violence in their league as an opportunity to proclaim the violent gospel of Jesus Christ that accomplishes peace with God and with ones fellow-man .

According to Article 3 , Section 1 , a church ceases to be in friendly cooperation with the Southern Baptist Convention when a church acts to " affirm , approve , or endorse homosexual behavior . " <p> Let us be clear : Cortezs arguments will be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him will become precedent for future pastors and churches looking to somehow escape the difficult and controversial topic of homosexuality and same-sex marriage . <p> In response , it is necessary for the Southern Baptist Convention to be proactive in creating its own precedent to lovingly and biblically respond to churches that violate official Southern Baptist teaching . False teaching threatens to lead astray not just Southern Baptist churches , but all churches that confess allegiance to Jesus Christ . This is not a matter of fidelity just to the Southern Baptist Convention . A response to such error is a matter of fidelity to the demands of the gospel and to the clear commands of Holy Scripture . <p> Cortez makes arguments that are gaining in popularity , despite their foreignness to Scripture and deviation from long-held understandings of Gods purpose for sexuality . For the sake of helping Christians and churches think through challenges and responses that come with cultures embrace of homosexuality , we want to review a few of the arguments that individuals like Danny Cortez use with increasing frequency and examine them against Scriptural exegesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we neither intend nor desire to offer a full and exhaustive response to every argument in use . <p> 1 . Argument : The use of " bearing fruit " in Matthew 7:15-20 is evidence that whatever produces a good outcome is therefore acceptable . Love , commitment , and intimacy for same-sex couples produces positive results in their lives . And since the Bible promotes or affirms whatever produces good fruit , same-sex relationships must be considered wholesome , moral , and praiseworthy . <p> Response : This argument simply assumes that the relevant biblical texts can not mean anything negative about homosexuality . In an ironic twist , it is based on an assumption about Matthew 7:15-16a text warning about false teachers , " You will know them by their fruits . " Because opposing homosexuality harms homosexuals ( a bad fruit ) , the traditional texts must be reinterpreted in a way that is no longer harmful to gay people . <p> Not only is this approach a gross misinterpretation of Jesus words in Matthew 7 , 1 it is also an uncritical use of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences that accrue to human actions . No human action is inherently good or evil in this theory , only its consequences . Thus one must not pronounce judgment on human actions , only on the consequences that flow from those actions . The problem with this theory is that it elevates our evaluation of consequences above Scripture as the standard for evaluating what is right and wrong . Also , consequentialism provides no objective definition of what defines a good or a bad consequence . A good consequence for one person may be a bad consequence for another. 2 <p> This argument alleges a variety of negative consequences that flow from calling homosexuality a sin . We must , therefore , modify/reinterpret the Bible so that people no longer feel badly about its sexual ethic . That is why Cortez and others have no problem sweeping away the 2,000-year old consensus of the Christian church . That consensus understanding of scripture causes some people to feel badly , so it must be done away with . I agree with Richard Hays comments on this approach to ethical reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequentialist ethical reasoning . The New Testament teaches us to approach ethical issues not by asking What will happen if I do x ? but rather by asking What is the will of God ? " 3 <p> Matthew 7:15-16 does have a warning for usto watch out for wolves in sheeps clothing . In this instance , Cortezs argument conceals the wolf of consequentialism in the clothing of Matthew 7 . In doing so , it manipulates readers so that they feel they are doing the right thing when they suppress the message of key texts : Romans 1:26-27 , 1 Corinthians 6:9 , 1 Timothy 1:10 , and Ephesians 5:21-33 . Readers would do well not to be taken in by the ruse . <p> 2 . Argument : According to Cortez , Paul is using Romans 1 and temple prostitution as a vivid and graphic display of humanitys wickedness and fallenness . Paul does not have in mind loving , committed same-sex relationships . <p> Response : The key verses to consider are Romans 1:26-27 , which read this way : <p> For this reason God gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural function for that which is unnatural , and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another , men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error . ( Rom. 1:26-27 NASB ) <p> One interpretation of this text says that Paul only aims to speak against excessive lust , not against committed same-sex relationships . The problem with this interpretation is that it has little basis in the text . These two verses express Gods judgment on the sin of idolatry . There are some people who exchange the truth of God for a lie and worship idols ( Rom. 1:25 ) . Gods judgment on idolaters is to " hand them over " to " degrading passions . " In other words , Gods judgment upon human sinfulness is to abandon people to desires that do not honor Him . For some people , that means that they are given over to same-sex desires and behavior . Such desires and behavior are " degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " error . " In short , same-sex desire and behavior are sinful ( Rom. 1:25-26 ) . <p> Paul is not singling out excessive lust for censure . Paul explicitly indicates that all same-sex desire and behavior is sinful and wrong . We know that because he describes it as " unnatural . " For Paul , both women and men who abandon the " natural function " of sexuality to engage in same-sex acts are committing sin . Revisionist interpreters say that " natural " refers to ones sexual orientation and that this verse only condemns people who participate in same-sex activity who have a heterosexual orientation . On that view , its not a sin to engage in homosexual behavior if one does so " naturally " that is , if one behaves in accordance with their own homosexual orientation . <p> But that 's not what Paul is talking about , is it ? For Paul , " natural " is not defined by ones personal orientation ( whatever that may be ) but by Gods intention and design in creation . For Paul , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Garden of Eden before the fall : one man and one woman in a covenantal heterosexual union . Any other kind of union is " unnatural " and sinful in Pauls way of thinking . In this way , this text rules out all same-sex desire and behavior , not just that which is based on lust . <p> 3 . Argument : Theres simply too much historical and cultural distance to know with accuracy whether Paul was speaking in universal terms about homosexuality . The brutality , misogyny , and sexual abuse seen in antiquity is a different world than what we know of modern same-sex relationships . It is difficult to talk about homosexuality today because it meant something entirely different in antiquity . <p> Response : There is not too much historical and cultural distance to understand what Paul means in the text . We have thirteen extant letters from Paul . We know the animating concerns of his theological outlook . We know of his concern for sexual purity among Gentile Christians ( e.g. , 1 Thess. 4:3ff ) . We also know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basis for new covenant norms ( 1 Cor. 5 ) . Paul is not being innovative or new in his approach to homosexuality . He is alluding to and sometimes even quoting the Old Testament to show that all sexual activity should be kept within the covenant of marriage . Any activity outside of the covenant of marriage is sinfuleither heterosexual or homosexual . This is no great mystery but has been the clear consensus of the entire 2,000-year history of the Christian Church . For all the differences that exist among Christians , this is not one of them . Sexual activity is only to be enjoyed between one man and one woman within the covenant of marriage . <p> It is not at all clear that ancient homosexuality is somehow qualitatively different than what we face in 2014 . Romans 1 teaches that some people have sexual desires for persons of the same sex . That is exactly what we have today . We can not relativize this teaching by a facile dismissal of the Bibles relevance to the modern world . To do this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral witness of Scripture . Are we to conclude that the Bibles prohibition on adultery is nullified now that we live in more humane conditions ? Are we to conclude that the Bibles condemnation on incest is null and void because ours is a kinder and gentler cultural moment ? Of course not . We understand the Bibles teaching to be timeless and authoritative no matter the time or culture . <p> 4 . Argument : The New Testament rendering of " homosexual " is a novelty . The words used in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 are innovations and not associated with todays understanding of sexual orientation . Further , there 's little use of it in antiquity . The evolution of the word gives us sufficient reason to cast doubt about the reliability of our translations . <p> Response : The term often translated as " homosexuality " is arsenokoit- " s , and it appears in both 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 . There is a second termmalakosthat also appears in 1 Corinthians 6:9 , and it means something like " soft . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for those who are lawless and rebellious , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers 10 and immoral men and homosexuals arsenokoit- " s and kidnappers and liars and perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching , ( 1 Tim . 1:9-10 ) <p> Taken together , these texts render an unambiguous judgment on these two terms . They are both sinful . Yet pastor Cortez argues that the terms do not refer to homosexuality in general but to excessive lust and pederasty ( same-sex relations between a man and a boy ) . According to Cortez , therefore , Paul may oppose exploitative same-sex relationships but not committed same-sex relationships . <p> Cortez has again adopted a revisionist interpretation that fails on a number of levels . It may very well be true that Pauls Greco-Roman context was dominated by the practice of pederasty . It is an illogical reduction , however , to shoehorn Pauls use of these two terms into that narrow frame . Paul is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . In fact , the term arsenokoit- " s appears nowhere else in Greek literature until Paul coins the term here . There were other words for homosexual behavior , but Paul did not choose them . Rather he coined a term that derives from the Greek translation of Leviticus 20:13 : arsenos koit- " n . In other words , Pauls sexual ethic is based entirely on his Jewish tradition whose scriptures were unambiguously opposed to all forms of homosexual behavior , not just exploitative ones . As commentators Roy Ciampa and Brian Rosner put it , " Paul opposed homosexual behavior on the basis of creation theology and because it is marked as a vice in the Torah and was stressed as a vice by Jews . Pauls opposition to all homosexual behaviorseems to derive from Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 , which represent absolute bans . " <p> Time and again , Paul quotes from the Jewish scriptures as the basis for his views . This is certainly the case in 1 Corinthians and especially in this particular section , which is freighted with material on sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 in his comments on an incestuous relationship . Later in chapter 6 , Paul quotes Genesis 2:24 to admonish men in the congregation who were visiting prostitutes . Likewise , in this text , Paul is alluding again to Leviticus to establish the sinfulness of homosexuality . The wider context of 1 Corinthians and its intertextual connections to the Old Testament make this clear . Paul uses the terms malakos and arsenokoit- " s to refer to the active and passive partners in a homosexual encounter . Like Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 , Paul identifies both halves of a homosexual coupling as sinful . Paul prohibits all forms of sexual relationships between same-sex couples . <p> Conclusion <p> It is a key assumption in arguments like those above that the writers of the New Testament lacked a modern comprehension of individuals with a same-sex orientation . But this approach to interpretation defies how the Scripture understands itself and distorts any credible doctrine of inspiration . If the Churcha pillar and buttress of the truth ( 1 Tim : 3:15 ) has been wrong on homosexuality , what else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical and eternal consequence that these arguments require us to address . The clarity and purposes for which God created us as sexual beings are n't  ancillary to the gospel . They are , rather , endemic to the gospel . Throughout the Old and New Testaments , sexuality served as a means of marking out Gods community amidst the world . In a very real way , if you want to see what Gods reign and rule looks like , you do so by observing the sexual patterns that order those within church . When we thwart Gods purposes for sexuality , we obscure His reign , and we bear false witness to the gospel ( 1 Cor. 6 : 9-20 ) . <p> One last word is warranted . The gospel never confronts us with the false alternatives of love and truth , or as Russell Moore described it " affirmation or alienation . " Those that would discard the biblical witness on sexuality often frame their newfound viewpoint around the obligation to either lovingly affirm their same-sex attracted friend or to persist with a biblical interpretation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether inside or outside the church . For many , this debate is framed as a choice between either Scriptural faithfulness or love of neighbor . The gospel does n't  pit love versus faithfulness ; truth versus grace . Love , of course , is the supreme command of God . We are called to love and serve God , while also loving and serving our neighbor . <p> The Scriptures never place love and faithfulness in opposition to one another . They co-exist with one another , since truth begets love and love begets truth . Where our same-sex attracted neighbors have experienced hardship , alienation , and bitterness from Christians , we must insist that it is Christians that have failed to obey Gods Holy Word at this very important point . But it is not a justification for abandoning love and truth . Subjugating truth to an unbiblical appropriation of " love " abandons love altogether . To our same-sex attracted neighbors within the church , we exhort you : Seek holiness as the Bible defines it . Seek love from your local community of believers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you , empowering you with His Spirit to overcome the temptations of the flesh . <p> For further study of the types of arguments made by Vines and Cortez , see : <p> 1 The " fruit " metaphor appears a number of times in Matthews gospel . Contrary to Vines , it does not signify bad outcomes generically . In the metaphor , fruit grows from a root . If a root is evil , then so will its fruit be evil . Conversely , evil fruit always comes from an evil root . In Matthew 3:8 , " fruit " symbolizes behavior that comes from a repentant heart . In Matthew 12:33 , " fruit " stands for blasphemous words which flow from an " evil " heart . In Matthew 13:8 , 23 , it signifies " a lifestyle which responds to the preaching of the word " ( R. T. France , The Gospel of Matthew , NICNT Grand Rapids : Eerdmans , 2007 , 291 ) . The good or bad quality of the fruit is determined solely by its conformity to Gods revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ( as Vines has it ) . Furthermore , Vines misuse of Matthew 7:15-16 would create ethical anarchy if applied consistently . To wit : It may cause someone personal distress and psychological " harm " to tell them that they should not murder their neighbor . That would be a " bad fruit " on Vines definition . Nevertheless , no one would permit murder just to avoid that " bad fruit .

Theatre of the Absurd , including Endgame , portrays the human condition absent any purpose , rationality or meaning - a picture , essentially , of life after the death of God . The term " endgame " refers to the final stage of a game when all meaningful moves have been played out . <p> I was reminded of Becketts play , and this particular line , upon reading a recent post at Slate presenting a melodramatic scene of a doctor announcing the sex of a newborn child ( never mind that the sex of most children is identified via ultrasound well before birth ) .

Theories about the " constructedness " ( as opposed to givenness ) of human sexuality and even of natural law itself have been trickling down from the ivory tower for decades , as evidenced in another passage fromEndgame about a toy dog one character is making : <p> Post-structural theorists who traffic in these deconstructive notions openly acknowledge that what is at stake is no less than an attack on the logocentrism that is the heart of both Judeo-Christian tradition and Western civilization . Yet , despite the ever-widening circulation of such ideas , its hard to take the Slate essay seriously - but not for the obvious reasons . <p> Such absurdity is , after all , to be expected " when gender identity is severed from its natural connection to sexual identity , " as Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote in response to the article . Even more , with the procreative purpose of sex all but played out ( as it is in our brave new world of reproductive technology and mix-and-match family-making ) , neither sexual identity nor sexual activity is connected to bodily form , but instead is but a game of genital roulette played out with any number of ambiguous chambers . <p> But the reason the article can not be taken seriously is simply that it does n't  take itself seriously . For if our physical bodies have nothing whatsoever to do with our identity as male or female , then , to paraphrase Becket , there is no more male or female . Why would a child assigned at birth as an " it " need to choose a gender at all ? Why even retain the binary of female/male ? After all , genderqueer is here , while Facebook offers 56 gender options for user profiles . The only logical outcome of the articles argument is asexuality . <p> The irony , of course , is that identity depends upon difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the seductive tyranny of caprice .

Both of these are horrifying conditions , which often result in harm to self and others , but we do not need a diagnosis to misuse or abuse what God has intended for good . <p> Feelings of guilt and pain can be easily corrupted .

Wallowing in false guilt is the fruit of fixing ones gaze on oneself rather than on the acceptance and freedom found in the gospel of Jesus Christ . <p> We are objectively guilty because we have sinned against God . Our subjective feelings of guilt , when they accurately reflect what the Scripture names sin , are a path to confession , repentance and a renewed experience of the grace of God .

@@100509507 @4709507/ <h> When to speak up and when to submit <p> Submission . It 's a word loaded with a powder keg of emotions . We live in a culture more accustomed to questioning authority than submitting to it . Those in leadership are often viewed with mistrust rather than respect . Many have felt the sting of poor leadership in their homes , churches , and government . For some , this word is associated with weakness and inability rather than strength and dignity . <p> However , the Bible provides us with simple and clear commands regarding submission . Wives should submit to their husbands as to the Lord ( Eph. 5:22 ) . Civilians should submit to their governing authorities ( Rom. 13:1 ) . God 's people should submit to their leaders in the church ( Heb. 13:17 ) . Jesus serves as the perfect example of submission , praying on the eve of his crucifixion , " Yet not my will , but yours be done " ( Luke 22:42 ) . Submission is part of the Christian life . None of us is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit in some form , Scripture also provides examples when God 's people disobeyed those in leadership so they could faithfully follow God 's commands . Rahab failed to submit to her king when she hid the Israelite spies . She chose to align herself with the people of God and was rewarded because of her actions ( Josh. 2:1-6 ; Heb. 11:31 ; James 2:25 ) . Abigail did n't submit to her husband 's sinful injustice toward David . She secretly met David and his men in order to rightly repay them for their service . Her discernment saved her family from the disaster that was upon them ( 1 Sam . 25:3-42 ) . Peter and the other apostles did n't submit to the Jewish leading council when commanded to refrain from speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus . They boldly replied , " We must obey God rather than men " ( Acts 5:29 ) . <p> These passages clarify that submission is not merely passive obedience to authority . It is an active and thoughtful obedience first to God and then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us will wrestle with God on how to apply the clear commands of Scripture in the complicated and gray areas of our experience . <p> How are we as believers to navigate the waters of submission when we find ourselves in a clash of callings ? What are we to do when our obedience to God or the betterment of his people collides with the call to submit to our husbands , churches , or governments ? Two biblical principles can guide us as we seek to honor God in our submission . <p> Principle #1 : It is Sinful to Submit to Sinful Commands <p> First , we must acknowledge that we should never submit to authorities by following their leadership into sinful actions . When King Darius ordered that no one could petition any god expect himself , Daniel was right to disobey the lesser command from Darius and continue his regular habit of prayer ( Dan . 6 ) . If a husband were to command a wife to stop reading the Bible or meeting with God 's people , she would be right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching of Scripture ( Col. 3:16 ; Heb. 10:25 ) . <p> In the book of Acts we are told the story of Ananias and his wife , Sapphira . Ananias sold a piece of property to give to the disciples but kept back for himself some of the proceeds , with the knowledge of his wife . When Peter confronted Ananias with his sinful actions , immediately Ananias fell down and died . A few hours later when Peter asked Sapphira about the piece of property , she continued in the lie and suffered the same consequence as her husband ( Acts 5:1-11 ) . A husband 's headship does n't mean his wife will escape judgment for her complicity in their sinful actions . When a husband , church , or government asks a Christian to sin , the believer always has the responsibility to obey God . <p> Principle #2 : It is Not Sinful to Influence or Persuade God-Given Authorities <p> An authority over us may choose a less wise course of action , but not necessarily a sinful one . Perhaps a wife truly believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children or would like to attend a more biblically based church , but her husband disagrees . Perhaps a church makes what some in the congregation feel is an unwise decision on using funds . Perhaps a government makes laws that seem to promote injustice , while not necessarily causing an individual to sin . While a believer may be called to submit in these areas , it is also appropriate to respectfully engage and present one 's case before his or her authority . <p> Here are a few principles that can guide us as we approach those in leadership with our concerns regarding their decisions . <p> 1 . Seek the Lord in prayer . <p> Before Nehemiah approached King Artaxerxes to speak with him about rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem , he went before the Lord in prayer and fasting . For four months he patiently prayed and waited before bringing the matter up to the king ( Neh. 1 ) . Prior to Esther presenting her request to her husband , she asked that Mordecai gather all the Jews together to fast on her behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first spend time in prayer and fasting , asking the Lord to bless our requests . It 's also important to pursue wise council and support from godly people . <p> 2 . Choose an appropriate time and place . <p> Esther asked King Xerxes to join her for a private feast before asking him to save her people from destruction . She did n't offer her request before all his officials in court but waited until they were alone , with only Haman there to hear her request ( Esther 4-5 ) . Each of us would be wise to consider the timing we choose to bring up areas of disagreement with those in authority . A wife might ask if she could meet her husband for lunch or dinner to discuss a specific topic . A church member would be wise to wait for a moment other than Sunday after the sermon to discuss his particular concern with his pastor . Choosing an appropriate time and location demonstrates respectful consideration of the person in authority over you . <p> 3 . Present your request with respectful boldness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very much afraid . " Esther also felt the weight of her request , telling Mordecai , " If I perish , I perish . " Yet both of them went before their leader with a respectful boldness that won them favor . They had the courage to ask , but they did so in a manner that honored the one of whom they made the request . As we seek to influence those in leadership over us , we can boldly put our requests before them , but we must do so a way that demonstrates respect to the role and authority God has given them in our lives . <p> 4 . Submit to God 's providence . <p> In the end , a husband may not agree to his wife 's request . A church may continue down a path that seems unwise . A government may make choices that fail to promote the welfare of those it governs . In these moments we must submit , trusting in the Lord and leaning not on our own understanding . Proverbs 21:1 encourages us : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of the LORD ; he turns it wherever he will . " Ultimately , God is providentially at work through the authorities in our lives . They are the human agents by whom God is fulfilling his good purpose for each of us ( Rom. 8:28 ) . <p> We are called first to submit our lives to God and second to those in authority over us . The way may not always be as clear as we would like , but our willingness to humbly entrust our submission to God forces us to a new and deeper understanding of his sovereign goodness . Thankfully , we follow first and foremost a Savior who knows not only the painful cost of submission , but also the joyful purposes for which God intends to use our willing obedience . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

Every soul lost through abortion is an image bearer of the King . But to take this even further , Christians are to also care about the least defended , the least protected , and the helpless .

You might even be surprised to notice that many abortion clinics are either right in the heart of an urban , poor neighborhood , or near a university campusnot a coincidence at all . In some cities there are people who are willing to pray outside these clinics and even seek to counsel women away from abortion as they arrive at the clinic . <p> If you want to be even more involved , find out where the local crisis pregnancy center is located .

Psalm 139:13 says : " ... for you formed my inward parts ; you knitted me together in my mothers womb . " This is where we start in the pro-life discussion . Life matters .

But this does n't  mean Dad was n't a teacher . Dads life spoke to me in ways that I still think of today . Most of these lessons were simply by following his example . <p> My father grew up in a broken home . He did n't  know his real father until he was fourteen years old . He dealt with the devastating effects of alcoholism and was forced to grow up fast . While still in high-school , he got up early to work at a bakery , using this income to support his mother ( my grandmother ) as she helped raise six children with my fathers step-dad . <p> While in his late teens , my father came to faith in Christ through the ministry of Billy Graham . He later met my mother , a Jewish girl who converted to Christianity , and they got married . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-collar guy , a licensed plumber , who has always been known for the quality of his work . It was n't the specific job he did but the way Dad carried himself that taught me the most about life , about manhood , and about living out the gospel . These five lessons are ones Ive adopted as I seek to honor the Lord with my life : <p> 1 . A real man acknowledges his dependence on God . Even though my father is a rugged , hardworking , " mans man " , he has always been unafraid to admit his weakness and need for Christ . I remember getting up every morning and seeing my father , up early , reading his Bible . <p> Now to be sure , I 'm not a morning person , so my sons do n't  find me up early reading the Bible . I do my Bible reading at other times , mostly at night . But I have tried to carry Dads dependence on the Word with me . Dad taught me the value of making Scripture the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of his children are actively following Christ to this day . <p> 2 . A real man takes his family to church every week . I guess I did n't  realize the importance of this until I became a father and had my own children . It was just assumed that every Sunday we went to church . There was never a question . No matter what was going on that week , no matter how tired Dad was , no matter who was playing whom that Sunday , we were in church . Dad had a pretty iron-clad policy : if you stayed home sick , then you were sick that whole day . You did n't  play hooky , pretend to be sick , and then play outside on Sunday . <p> For a young man , this is an important visual statement . Kids need to see their fathers faithfully leading them to church every week . This tells the family that worship of the risen Christ matters so much so that we voluntarily set aside a day each week in worship . What 's more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Bible-believing church . Dad gave himself , his time , his money , and his talents to the work of the Kingdom . I hope that one day my kids will say the same thing about me . <p> 3 . A real man works hard to provide for his family . Again , I did n't  realize how rare this is until I grew older and observed the sad lack of purpose and vision among contemporary men . Dad modeled what it looks like to get up every day , whether he liked it or not , and go to work for the family . Plumbing is a hard job . Its physically demanding and requires focus and discipline . But Dad never wavered in his commitment to provide for us . <p> I remember asking Dad , " Dad , do you ever get tired of doing this every single day ? " His reply , " Son , yes . I do . But then I remember that I do n't  get tired of eating . I do n't  get tired of having a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs taken care of . So I quickly get untired of working . " <p> Great answer . Not every day at work , even in your chosen vocation where you are working in your giftedness , is a day at the beach . Many days are mundane . Some are frustrating . Some days you want to quit , even in the best of jobs . But a real man , a man of God , labors to provide for the ones God has called him to love and serve . By Gods grace , I 've tried to carry on this work ethic , and it will benefit me my entire life . <p> 4 . A real man loves his wife unconditionally , in good times and bad . My parents have been married for thirty eight years . There have been many hardships along the way . My mother endured seven miscarriages . Shes been afflicted by illness . Dad has seen his own share of health challenges and , lately , unemployment struggles as the housing industry in the Chicago area has suffered . Dad has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , everyday faithfulness . Not all of life is easy . Many seasons are hard and difficult and make you want to get up and walk away . Dads faithfulness in good and bad seasons has shown me what a real man does : he endures . <p> I pray its said of me that I have the same character and faithfulness Dad exhibited . He is n't perfect and neither am I. We are both in need of Gods amazing grace to cover our many sins . But if I could be half the man Dad has been in his life , that would be enough for me . <p> 5 . A real man is a living witness of the gospel in the daily grind of life . This is related to point #3 . Dad not only worked hard , he took pride in his work . I remember asking Dad when I was working alongside him at 14 years old why he cared that the drain pipes we were installing inside the walls had to be so straight . " Nobody will see them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them . God sees them . That matters . " Dad did his work with excellence , even staying an extra hour to get that one thing right that did n't  much matter to me . But it does matter , because the work we do with our hands reflects the Creator . He s given us a job to do , and we should do it wellto His glory . <p> Dads work was his witness to an unsaved and watching world . The construction trades are not exactly a haven of clean-living . Dad never heard of the words missional and incarnational . He just got up every day and did the very best job he could . And this work was a witness . He was unafraid to vocally share his faith on the job , even though those opportunities were rare . I can tell you , however , that everyone who worked with my father knew he was a Christian , mostly because of the quality work he did . <p> Too many people in our day and age do n't  know the treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , that I do . In fact , my father is one of my heroes because he showed me what it looks like for a Christian man to live out his faith in the nitty-gritty , daily grind of life , among a lost and sinful people . And I 'll never , ever forget it . 43169 @qwx903169 43173 @qwx903173 43174 @qwx903174

Along the way , policies were implemented to help shape these attitudes : taxes on cigarettes and bans on smoking in public locations , to name a few . <p> At its best , public policy incentivizes people to behave in healthy , beneficial , and productive ways . As with smoking , we ought to craft policies that recognize the damage broken families have on our society . <p> Though many are experimental , there are countless policy ideas that could help strengthen families in America : tax credits to offset the cost of raising children , education and training programs ( like the Oklahoma Marriage Initiative ) , reformed divorce laws , career academies and many others . <p> Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family breakdown is a crisis with wide-ranging societal ramifications .

@@100509519 @4709519/ <p> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ; fools despise wisdom and instruction . <p> -Proverbs 1:7 <p> In our first post of this series on thinking biblically about faith , work , and economics , we suggested five tools , or mental models , that should shape and support our thinking and decision-making , as well as help us build a holistic biblical worldview . By using these tools , we can take biblical principles and apply them to various situations that we encounter in our daily lives . <p> We have looked at the first two , " personal vision " and " gifts and talents , " now we want to turn to the third tool , " wisdom and knowledge . " <p> At first glance , it seems that the authors of the Bible use the words " wisdom , " " knowledge , " and a third term , " understanding , " almost interchangeably . A closer examination shows a difference in the way the three terms are used . This difference is very important for our understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Simply put , these gifts as they are called in the Bible are defined as : <p> Those with knowledge are able to collect , remember , and access information . But , it is possible to have knowledge and lack understanding and wisdom .

They " see through " the facts to the dynamics of what , how , and why . Understanding is a lens which brings the facts into crisp focus and produces principles . <p> Those with wisdom know which principle to apply in a given context . Understanding without wisdom can appear contradictory ( Proverbs 26:4-5 ) . For example , the statement , " He who hesitates is lost , " is true , but so is the idea that " haste makes waste .

But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom . <p> The following table may help you visualize the difference between these three terms : <p> Knowledge <p> Understanding <p> Wisdom <p> Facts <p> Meaning <p> What to Do Next <p> Information <p> Principles <p> Application <p> Memory <p> Reason <p> Action <p> Scholars <p> Teachers <p> Practitioners <p> In any given situation , God rarely gives all three gifts to any one person .

But first let 's look closer at this idea of knowledge . <p> The New Testament word " disciple " literally means " a learner . " Christians are called to a careful study of the Bible . This will help us acquire the knowledge that we need in order to do what God has call us to do . Jesus said , <p> If you abide in My word , you are My disciples indeed .

@@100509520 @4709520/ <h> TRANSCRIPT : How should churches think about the topic of sexual abuse ? <p> One of the questions that has come up , related to the theme of the conference of The Gospel and Human Sexuality , is about the issue of sex abuse . So how should churches think about the topic of sexual abuse , and what counsel would you give to pastors if somebody were to come to them reporting an experience of sex abuse ? How should they handle that kind of situation ? <p> Well , if someone comes and says I 've been abused sexually , or I know someone who has been abused sexually , you have to first of all recognize that there are two authorities at work here , and both of them need to be involved : Caesar has a responsibility to deal with this at the civil level ; The church has a responsibility to deal with this at the ecclesial level . You immediately call the police , even if you do n't  know whether or not this is trueyou do n't  know whether or not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Caesar has a responsibility ; the government has a responsibility to investigate this . You also though have toyou ca n't simply say well , we have sex abuse happening , and that 's a civil issue so the civil state deals with it . They do . But you also come in and deal with it in terms of church discipline , which means you are saying if this is someone who is sexually predatory in our congregation , we are also going to deal with it at the level of church discipline , and we are going to deal with this very , very seriously . <p> All the way up to that point you do a number of things as well . And I think churches are getting better at this , though not good enough in many cases . You come in and say how do we do background checks on people who are going to be working with children or with teenagers in our congregation ? How do we inform people in our congregations what to do if they suspect that there might be something bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they let them know ? You start communicating that . And I think sometimes churches just do n't  do that because they are saying we do n't  have a problem here right now , and if we say that , that is going to alarm people . But it does n't  alarm people . Instead it gives people a sense of you actually know how serious this is , and you are taking proactive measures to make sure that it does n't  happen . <p> And then you also have in place ways to minister to people who have been sexually abused , whether somebody who was sexually abused very recently , or whether it iswhen you just look around at our culture and how many people have been preyed upon sexually , there are people in your congregation , no matter where you are , right now , and some of them are battling with all sorts of psychological issues that come with people saying to them or implying to them that somehow they were at fault or to blame . You need to eradicate that and say no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ministering to you as somebody who was a victim or who is continuingly a victim of what has been done to you . To be able to talk about this so its not something that someone who has experienced this is thinking well , I am the only one , and if I were to come forward about this they are going to act as though I am crazy , or they are going to act as though I did something to cause this to happen . Or they are going to act like I am somehow spiritually defective . No ! None of those things are true . So that person who has been abused , we need to be the people who are ministering to that person as well . And so I think that means being very diligent about protecting and then also being very diligent about ministering to those who have been hurt . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> In the United States , April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month , an observance to raise public awareness about sexual violence and to educate communities on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sexual assault in America : ...

@@100509522 @4709522/ <h> Issue Analysis : Human cloning <p> For the first time , scientists have cloned cells from two adults to create human embryos . This technical breakthrough follows similar research last year , which created cloned embryos from infant and fetal cells . Here is what every Christian should know about human cloning : <p> What is cloning ? <p> Cloning is a form of reproduction in which offspring result not from the chance union of egg and sperm ( sexual reproduction ) but from the deliberate replication of the genetic makeup of another single individual ( asexual reproduction ) . Human cloning , therefore , is the asexual production of a new human organism that is , at all stages of development , genetically virtually identical to a currently existing or previously existing human being . <p> How does therapeutic cloning differ from reproductive cloning ? <p> The use of the term ' therapeutic ' and ' reproductive in reference to cloning is misleading . All cloning produces a human embryo and is therefore reproductive in nature . The more accurate phrasing is ' **27;148;TOOLONG ' and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the creation of an embryo for subsequent destruction and one that is created in order to continue the normal process of human development . <p> What is the process of human cloning ? <p> Cloning is achieved by a technique referred to as somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) . The process involves introducing the nuclear material of a human somatic cell ( donor ) into an oocyte ( egg cell ) whose own nucleus has been removed or inactivated , and then stimulating this new entity to begin dividing and growing , yielding a cloned human embryo . <p> Does cloning produce an exact genetic replica of the donor ? <p> No . All human cells , including eggs and sperm , contain small , energy-producing organelles called mitochondria . Mitochondria contain a small piece of DNA that specifies the genetic instructions for making several essential mitochondrial proteins . SCNT transfers the nucleus into the oocyte , which contains mitochondrial DNA of the egg donor . Just as in sexual reproduction , the embryo produced by cloning contains genetic material from two different individuals . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those produced by sexual reproduction or in-vitro fertilization ? <p> Due to missing , but crucial interactions between the sperm and egg , genetic reprogramming errors are inherent to cloning . This leads to random , widespread genetic imprinting and epigenetic defects that are both known causes of cancer . In addition to the epigenetic defects , cells derived from cloning that are injected back into the donor are rejected because of epigenetic mis-expression , genetic differences due to mitochondrial DNA , and the incompatibility of cells too immature in development to interact with adult tissue environments . This is the major stumbling block for using material from cloned embryos for the treatment of diseases . <p> What are the ethical problems concerning human cloning ? <p> The primary moral objection to cloning-for-research is the same as for all embryo-destructive researchit creates human life solely for the purpose of destroying it ; using a human embryo merely as a means to an end ( e.g. , " spare parts " ) . <p> The objection to cloning-to-produce children are similar in that it poses a threat to the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if the process could be made safe , though , it has the potential to alter the " DNA ecosystem " in ways that are un-predictable and thus potentially injurious to human and non-human life . For these reasons , Christians should continue to oppose all forms of human cloning as unethical and unnecessary . <p> Isnt concern about the moral status of the embryo based on religious premises ? Why should someone who does n't  agree with that position reject cloning ? <p> While it is true that many people oppose the cloning of human embryos for religious and ethical reasons , the issue is not divided along the typical left/right political spectrum . Even pro-choice advocates and others who hold liberal and progressive political views find sufficient ethical concerns for opposing the procedure . <p> In recent testimony , one researcher stated that stem cells might be able to provide up to 1.7 million therapies per year . This would require a minimum of 5-8 million human eggs per year assuming a very optimistically high success rate of 1 stem cell culture out of 3-5 clonal embryos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From women in this country or abroad , and it is highly likely that many of these women will have to become repeat donors . Egg donation can have significant health impacts on women . Of particular concern are ( 1 ) the super-ovulating drugs that women are given in order to provide the eggs for embryo cloning , ( 2 ) numerous hormone treatments given to ease egg extraction , and ( 3 ) the extraction process itself . Risks to women from egg donation include a potential link to ovarian cysts and cancers , severe pelvic pain , rupture of the ovaries , bleeding into the abdominal cavity , acute respiratory distress , pulmonary embolism , and possible negative effects on future fertility . Most women who are lured into this process are economically disenfranchised and perform this operation because they are in financial need and seek payment for their eggs . <p> Does n't a ban on therapeutic cloning remove a promising venue for biomedical research ? <p> Currently , the primary justification for therapeutic cloning is as a means of harvesting embryonic stem cells . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that use . Cloning , however , not only compounds the ethical concerns of embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) research but also adds a significant number of other moral problems . This Machiavellian approach would be difficult to justify even if ESC research were to lead to miraculous cures . <p> But ESC research has proven to be a failure . There are more than 70 conditions currently being treated with adult stem cells , and zero with embryonic stem cells . Despite the media hype of the early 2000s , embryonic stem cell research has proven to be useless at treating medical conditions . When tested on animals , embryonic stem cells turned into tumors . As biological engineer James Sherley once explained , " Figuring out how to use human embryonic stem cells directly by transplantation into patients is tantamount to solving the cancer problem . " <p> When time and money are limited it 's both irrational and immoral to divert funding and attention from promising areas of research to ones that have absolutely no evidence of producing results . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we asked that question after the arrival of a newborn or after receiving the result of a sonogram ?

@@100509523 @4709523/ <h> Issues Analysis : End-of-life - The dying process <p> End-of-life issues are the various topics and ethical concerns that arise during the time surrounding death . ERLC is developing issue analysis briefs to address a broad range of issues , from decision-making to euthanasia , that concern the end of life . <p> The purpose of this brief on the " dying process " is to provide a broad , general overview on how Christians should think about death and dying . <p> What is the Christian view of death ? <p> Death is common , but not natural . Death entered the world because of the sin of one man , but was conquered by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ ( 1 Cor. 15:21 ) . Death is so unnatural that God sent his one and only Son as a sacrifice so that we might have life ( John 10:10 ; Revelation 1:18 ) . <p> Death should therefore be considered an enemy but a defeated enemy . Although this enemy may win a temporary victory over us , those who know Jesus will ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when we lose our life we will gain it back in the resurrection . <p> We do not need to fear death , nor hold on to life too tightly . We can trust that God is in control and that for those who love God all things work together for good ( Romans 8:28 ) . <p> What does it mean to say that a person is dying ? <p> When we say that someone is dying , we mean that they have entered the dying process . The dying process is the final stage of the living process , since those who are in the process of dying are still in the process of living . Those who are dying must therefore be treated with the same respect and consideration due to all living human beings . ( John 13:35 ) . One way that we can express love for the dying is to show that we are grateful for their continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving a person is a way of saying , " Its good that you exist ; its good that you are in the world ! " Those who are nearing the end of lives need to know that it is good that they exist , that its good that they are still in the world . And they need to know that we are with them , loving them , as they enter this final stage of their lives . <p> How do we know when someone has entered the dying process ? <p> When a person suffers a potentially fatal threat to their health ( e.g. , disease , injury ) , their impaired condition may be either reversible or irreversible . If the condition is reversible , appropriate medical intervention and treatment exists that may possibly restore a person to a state where they are no longer in imminent danger of dying . However , if no effective intervention or treatment is possible , the condition is irreversible ( i.e. , terminal ) and the impaired condition will lead to death . This is what is meant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the dying process . <p> Two key considerations in end-of-life issues are the persons ( 1 ) nearness to death and ( 2 ) their ability to interact with the world . <p> Nearness to death Although we may not be able to know with certainty , we can often determine how near a person is to death , whether death is imminent or non-imminent . Imminent is when a person is expected to die in a relatively short period of time , such as hours , days , or weeks . If a person is not expected to die for months or years , then death is considered to be non-imminent . <p> Ability to interact with the world A person in the process of dying may be either conscious ( or potentially conscious ) or permanently unconscious . A person who is conscious and in the dying process maintains the ability to communicate with those around them and express their wishes for continued medical intervention and treatment . A person who is permanently unconscious and in the dying process must rely on other people to determine their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the dying process be treated ? <p> Whether death is imminent or non-imminent , our first consideration for dealing with people in the dying process is that we take no action with the intention of hastening the end of their life . As bioethicist Gilbert Meilander explains , " Allowing to die is permitted ; killing is not . Within these limits lies the sphere of our freedom . " <p> Within these boundaries lies four types of care that we owe the dying : curative care , symptom care , comfort care , and respect care . <p> Curative care Life is a gift from God that we may not choose to discard . When life can be continued , we must choose that option . Medical intervention that restores health and reverses the dying process should therefore be the first option . <p> Symptom care In some situations , a person may not be in imminent danger of dying yet may have a fatal condition that is not reversible . For instance , a person may have an inoperable cancerous tumor on their lungs that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the non-imminent dying process , they may suffer symptoms such as shortness of breath that requires medical intervention , such as artificial respiration . Out of respect for life and to prevent unnecessary suffering , all necessary symptom carea form of palliative careshould be provided until death become imminent . <p> Comfort care People in the dying process should not suffer needlessly . When death becomes imminent , palliative care should shift from symptom care to comfort care . The main distinction is that comfort care focuses on providing direct relief from the stress and pain of dying . Comfort care is provided to make the last state of dying as comfortable as possible . <p> Respect care The dying process often leads to deterioration of the body . Because a person is often unable to care for their own bodies , they may feel a loss of control . Our duty is to provide such care for people unable to take care of themselves in a way that restores their sense of dignity . We should , for example , ensure that their bodies are adequately cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from unnecessary exposure . No matter what stage a person is in the dying or living process , respect care should be provided to all who are in need . <p> ( Note : Because of the broad range of ethical issues that arise when dealing with people who are permanently unconscious and in the dying process , a separate issue analysis will cover this topic in more detail . ) <p> How should we prepare for the dying process ? <p> The most important step an individual can take when preparing for the dying process is to ensure that they know Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior . ( Romans 6:23 ) . We have no reason to fear either death or the eternal consequences of our sin when we believe in Jesus ( John 3:16 ) . <p> The second step is to ensure that we have made every effort to be at peace with those we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sinned against you , tell them their fault and attempt to reconcile ( Matthew 18:15 ) . Forgive those who have harmed you and let go of any anger and resentment you may harbor in your heart ( Matthew 6:14-15 ; Proverbs 19:11 ) . <p> The third step is to recognize that we do not enter this world alone and , if we are blessed , we will not leave alone . Just as families are involved in birth , they should be involved in death . While we do not want to put unnecessary burdens on our families when they will be going through a difficult period of sadness and grief , we should include them whenever possible in the ethical and medical decisions that will need to be made . <p> Communicate to your loved one the principles and priorities that should guide your end-of-life treatment . But do n't  use this time as an opportunity to exercise unrestrained self-autonomy . Explain to them your wishes , but allow them within ethical boundaries to have some say in how you will be cared for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the issue analysis on end-of-life decision-making . ) <p> The last step is to cast your anxieties upon Jesus ( 1 Peter 5:7 ) .

Waste no time chastising yourself for the failure to be strong , but simply give your weakness up to God .

And so as long as our kids do n't  know that there is Laverne and Shirley out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What happened is that those children , when they went to anyone elses home are immediately in front of the television , and they are just glued to this because it is this sense of the forbidden that their parents wont even talk to them about , so they think it must be great . And you know , we are saying we want to play outside , and this is just the information channel giving you what 's on the other channels ; this is n't even anything to watch . But it was something they really were driven toward . I think the same thing can happen here . <p> I think we are living in the sort of world where keeping children from understanding what is going on in the outside is n't going to be possible .

You do not want to create that in your children . <p> And so to create the sort of children who recognize what the scripture teaches , what we believe as a family , while also loving people in their neighborhood , not being harsh or condemnatory toward people in their neighborhood . I had to deal with this last night , not about the situation you mentioned , but one of my sons , my younger sons came to me and said I have a friend in the neighborhood , and his dad is an atheist .

And yes , you should be friends with Ronnie . <p> I think we have to do the same thing , and every congregation is going to deal with this with cohabiting parents , with everything else . I remember the first time that one of my children came in and asked me what 's divorcevery , very youngbecause a friend in the neighborhood had parents who had divorced .

The nonprofit cases have yet to work their way up to the high court . <p> While some conscientious objectors to the HHS rule oppose underwriting all contraceptives , Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood protest paying only for abortion-causing drugs . Federal appeals courts reached different conclusions last year in the lawsuits . The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled for the federal government in Conestoga Wood 's challenge , while the 10th Circuit Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the case is rooted in theology and America 's founding , Moore said . <p> " The government does n't grant us religious liberty ; God does , " he told Baptist Press in a written statement . " The government is to recognize that God-given natural right for all persons to freely exercise their religious convictions . <p> " What 's at stake is the heritage our forefathers bought with their blood , " Moore said . " More than that , what 's at stake is the truth that God alone , and not Caesar , is Lord of the conscience . " <p> A major question the Supreme Court will consider in the case is whether owners of for-profit companies can exercise their religion in the conduct of their businesses . A divided three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court ruled that for-profit , secular organizations " can not engage in religious exercise . " The 10th Circuit in Denver rejected the Obama administration 's argument that protections under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act do not extend to for-profit companies . It ruled corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of RFRA . <p> The U.S. Constitution and RFRA protect people of faith in their business practices , according to the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Becket Fund . <p> The federal government " asserts that when people of faith try to earn a living in business , they lose freedom to act consistent with their faith , " said Bowman , whose organization , ADF , represents Conestoga Wood . " But Americans do not give up their freedoms when they open a family business , and no American family should be forced to choose between following their faith and submitting to unlawful and unnecessary government mandates . " <p> Hawley said in an interview with The Pathway , newsjournal of the Missouri Baptist Convention : " You do n't lose your free exercise rights when you open a business in this country . That 's never been the law . That 's not what the Constitution says . Business owners have a right to run their businesses in accord with their religious convictions just like everybody else . " <p> The Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use narrow means to burden a person 's religious exercise -- also guards the rights of for-profit owners , Hawley said . <p> The Becket Fund 's argument " is that the government does not have a compelling interest in forcing business owners to provide these abortion-inducing drugs , " he said . " They have n't pursued their interests in the appropriate way . And , therefore , since it violates the Greens ' religious faith they ca n't make it stick under this law . " <p> The SBC 's Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Christian Legal Society in support of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood . Also among the 59 briefs supporting Hobby Lobby and/or Conestoga Wood , according to the Becket Fund , was one signed on to by Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary ; its president , Daniel Akin ; Southern Baptist mega-church pastor and author Rick Warren ; Southern Baptist professors ; and at least one other Southern Baptist pastor . <p> Also filing briefs for the businesses were congressional members from both political parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roman Catholic theologians , the National Religious Broadcasters , Council for Christian Colleges and Universities , National Association of Evangelicals , U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , Democrats for Life and Christian Medical Association . <p> The 23 briefs filed in opposition to the two businesses , according to the Becket Fund , included more than 100 Democratic members of Congress , 16 states , the ACLU and Freedom From Religion Foundation . <p> The HHS regulation requires coverage of such drugs as Plan B and other " morning-after " pills that possess a post-fertilization mechanism that can cause an abortion by preventing implantation of tiny embryos . The rule also covers " ella , " which -- in a fashion similar to the abortion drug RU 486 -- can act even after implantation to end the life of the child . <p> HHS provided an exemption to the rule for churches and their auxiliaries but did not extend it to non-church-related , nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies that object . The administration also offered an accommodation for non-church-related religious organizations , but critics said it was inadequate because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs through third parties . <p> Hobby Lobby 's Green family has said it will not comply with the mandate if it loses in court . The arts and crafts retail chain of more than 600 stores could face fines totaling $1.3 million a day . Hobby Lobby seeks to honor God " by operating the company in a manner consistent with Biblical principles , " according to its statement of purpose . Its stores are closed on Sundays . <p> The Hahn family , which owns Conestoga Wood , has been living under the mandate since its group health plan was renewed in January 2013 . Refusal to abide by the mandate could cost the family an estimated $95,000 a day . Conestoga Wood is a wholesale manufacturer of kitchen cabinet parts . 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170 
@@100509526 @4709526/ <h> TRANSCRIPT : What is the biggest threat to religious liberty today ? <p> The question for this episode is , " What do you think is the biggest threat to religious liberty , and how should the church respond ? " <p> Well , I mean I think the biggest threat right now when it comes to religious liberty has to do with the sexual issues . In the founding era of the republic most of the problems that our Baptist forbears were dealing with had to do with the government setting up and funding Anglican churches . It really was n't about Anglicanism , it was about money . Youve got an establishment that likes the government money , likes the government power , and they want to run out the competition . That 's what its really about . <p> Now its not so much about money . Its about sex . And so you are dealing with , I 'm dealing with , every single day Ive been dealing all day long with the sorts of issues where for instance you have a Christian who says I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer or by renting out the hall or something like thatnow , being prosecuted , having fines levied againstthose sorts of things are happening increasingly . That 's also what is happening with for instance the HHS mandate saying you really do n't  have any choice but to fund or empower drugs that you believe to be violating your free exercise of religion . <p> And then things like Catholic adoption agencies in Massachusetts that are n't  able to be in business anymore because they 're saying we place children only in homes with both a mom and dad . They are not saying we think everybody else ought to be illegal . They are saying that weand they cant get a state license to do it . And so that 's where I think right now the locus of religious liberty issues in this country is . <p> And I think one of the problems too is that for a long time evangelical Christianity at the lay-populous level has had a narrow vision of religious liberty because we have n't had a lot of threats to it in a real sense . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my job a lot more difficult now is that you have had some people who have n't thought through that what our Baptist forbears were saying is rightthat religious liberty is an image-of-God issue . Its not a who-has-the-most-votes issue . And so that means were the people who ought to be saying the loudest no , no , no , no , we do n't  want the mayor and the city council to say that a mosque ca n't be in our town . Because a mayor and a city council that can say that , is a mayor and a city councilbecause its a mosquethat has too much power . And the government does n't  decide that . Weve got to be the people who are saying that . <p> And then secondly we 've had a lot of people who have cried wolf over situations , they 've cried persecution when there is no persecution , which is just as dangerous as saying peace , peace , when there is no peaceif you say war , war , where there is no war . So you have these kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady at WalMart says , " Happy Holidays " instead of " Merry Christmas . " What happens when that goes on long enoughand its every single year the same sort of thing happensthen you wind up with people saying yeah , that 's what they always say . So they do n't  pay attention when there really are serious restrictions of free exercise and religious liberty that now are coming upon us. 43169 @qwx903169 43185 @qwx903185 43171 @qwx903171 43170 @qwx903170 
@@100509527 @4709527/ <h> Why Jesus wants yall to speak Southern <p> It is an inclusive and precise term.Yall is a second-person plural , meaning it is a plural version of " you . " So , for example , somebody would say : " You want to go to the game ? " if referring to a single person , and " Yall want to go to the game ? " if referring to a group of people . The distinction seems to me as linguistically important as the distinction between " I " and " we " and between " he/she " and " they . " <p> At one time , English used " thou " as second-person singular and the word you as the plural form , but that usage faded in America about a century and a half after the Mayflower dropped anchor , leaving Americans with the imprecision of you performing double duty . Southerners came to the linguistic rescue of their fellow countrymen with the wonderful word " yall . " <p> It is common for those outside the South to malign and misrepresent Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grizzard explained once , <p> The biggest mistake people from outside the South make in the y'all area is they do n't think we say y'all at all . They think we say " you all . " A Southerner visiting the North surely will be mocked the first time he or she opens his or her mouth and out comes a Southern accent . Northerners will giggle and ask , " So where are you all from ? " I answer by saying , " I all is from Atlanta . " Southerners rarely use " you all " in any situation but they never , never , ever , ever , use it when addressing just one person . <p> My primary interest in the word y'all is its theological importance . Here is our persistent problem : The Bible is most often written in the plural but most of us read it in the singular . We tend to come to Scripture for individualized answers to individualized questions . We read the Bible as if it is all about us as individuals . Thus , every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second-person singular when it is almost always a second-person plural -- yall . Our captivity to individualized grammar makes the gracious gift of cruciform community largely unintelligible . <p> In The Unnecessary Pastor , author , educator and Northerner Marva Dawn perceptively explains " We all need to become Southerners to read the Bible correctly , because to inhabit its world is to speak about our lives as yall ( plural ) , instead of you ( singular ) . " She further notes , " To distinguish between you as an intimate acquaintance , you as someone I do not address in intimate terms because of respect or a less-developed relationship , and you as a larger group in which I am but a part helps me to have a more truthful sense of my place in the whole . " Dawn adds , " It takes a long process to change the Western individualized vocabulary that is ruining our church . <p> Inhabitants of Western culture tend to view the world with self at the center of everything , but there is no room for radical individualism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual , one that locates the individuals identity and value in Christ , his Kingdom and his church . The three are inextricable . The New Testament goes so far as to say Christ does not even reckon himself complete apart from the church . In Ephesians 1:23 , Paul describes the church as " his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all . " John Calvin , in his commentary The Epistles of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians , explains the implications of the same Pauline verse : <p> This is the highest honor of the Church , that , until He is united to us , the Son of God reckons himself in some measure imperfect . What consolation is it for us to learn , that , not until we are along with him , does he possess all his parts , or wish to be regarded as complete ! ) . <p> If Christ does not even reckon himself complete apart from the church , how can the individual Christian do so ? The individual believer is a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of a community of believers who are called to fight the spiritual battle together , not as isolated individuals ( Col. 1:13 , Eph. 6:10-18 ) . The believer initially comes to Christ individually by faith , but no follower of Christ should envision living the Christian life outside of Christ or his Kingdom outpost -- the church . Even our thoughts about corporate church life tend to be too often individualized , as though the church exists as an instrument to fulfill our personal needs rather than as the body of Christ to transform the cosmos . <p> Our individualized thinking and imprecise grammar have served to eclipse the subversive nature of Christian community , faith and living . When someone conceives of Christianity in an isolated and individualized manner , the tendency is to focus on personal contentment and survival . When we disregard the fact that Christ purchased our unity with himself and with one another ( Eph. 2:11-22 ) , we lose a sense of the grand eschatological story of Christ that we have been swept into , and we often vainly attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we often think a sermon podcast is as good as being in the corporate worship service ; after all , we still get the biblical information we personally need to live our best life now . <p> But what if we thought about our lives in the plural and acted on that plurality ? What if we thought of preaching as a gathered flock communally hearing the voice of our Shepherd-King , who is forming us together as cruciform community by the authority and power of his word ? What if we thought about the Great Commission in terms of cosmic warfare to which we have been summoned together as an army of good soldiers of King Jesus ? What if we thought of sanctification itself as a community project , rather than an individual experience ? <p> Consider how a more theologically precise gospel grammar rescues us from the hopelessness of thinking of ourselves as a church of one : <p> This mystery , which is Christ in yall , the hope of glory ( Col. 1:27 ) . <p> Yall count it all joy , my brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Finally , yall be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might . Yall put on the whole armor of God , that yall may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil ( Eph 6:10-11 ) . <p> The power of Christian community is profound . Together we hope , together we count it all joy , together we are strong in the Lord , and together we put on the armor of God . As individuals we will struggle , but our lives are woven into the fabric of the Gospel community .

He urged members of the media in attendance to act on their calling as the bullhorn for the minority . <p> To visualize the urgency of the matter , Johnson shared footage aired on Egyptian television that showed the moments immediately prior to an execution of a Christian . After viscerally describing the execution that followed , Johnson said , " If a moderate Muslim broadcaster can tell that story , American media can tell that story , and certainly Christian media must tell these stories .

My gut response was to lift them up in prayer . But what else could be done ? <p> Enter Johnnie Moore of Liberty University . One of the final speakers , he assured those who shared the lectern their words would not be forgotten by the 50 percent of the world under the age of 25 . " I want you to know you have the voice of the next generation , if its only my voice . Its not the end of anything , its the beginning of it .

@@100509530 @4709530/ <h> What baseball can teach us about Christian living <p> Baseball means dealing with failure . " There is more Met than Yankee in all of us , " as Roger Angell has poignantly wrote in The Summer Game . <p> Every person who has ever played the game of baseball has been a consistent failure . It has been more than 70 years since the Splendid Splinter , Ted Williams , finished the 1941 baseball season with a .406 batting average . Williams ' failure rate of 60 percent means that he failed less often than any batter in the seven subsequent decades . In fact , only five other players in the live ball era ( since 1920 ) have matched the success of his 60 percent failure rate . Babe Ruth , known for hitting 714 home runs , struck out 1,330 times in his Major League Baseball career . The Cy Young Award is baseball 's most coveted honor for the game 's best pitcher each season , yet the award 's namesake lost 316 games as a major league pitcher . <p> Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ballgame , " is a celebration of hope in the midst of managed failure . Singing " Take Me Out to the Ballgame " during the 7th inning stretch is a communal baseball rite of passage . Timothy A. Johnson notes how the song celebrates failure both musically and lyrically , " Instead of celebrating a run or a victory , the song celebrates the act of striking out , the batters utter failure . He continues , " There is no spectacular hit to drive in runnersno heroic walk-off home run , no victory for the home teamand the structural melodic line . . . aptly reflects this failure . Striking out is represented musically in a deep structural way , by the failure of the melodic line to reach its rightful goalits home , its originthrough a proper descent to the tonic " ( " I Never Get Back : How Take Me Out to the Ballgame Succeeds in Celebrating Failure , " The National Pastime 2008 , 143 ) . <p> The reality that baseball is a game of managed failure for every player , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game imbedded so deeply in the fabric of American culture . Baseball became the national pastime because it reflected the national charactera collective team endeavor that called consistently for individual responsibility and personal sacrifice for the greater good . John Updike asserted that baseball is " an essentially lonely game . " Once the batting order is set , there is nowhere to hide ; a turn at the plate is coming . The fact that the whole team is counting on the each batter produces the possibility of personal exultation or humiliation . Unlike other youth sports , baseball does n't permit a game to be dominated by a star player whose teammates are simply along for the ride . <p> I fear that one of the reasons for the waning popularity of baseball in American culture is not because the game has changed , but because we have changed . It takes time and patience to understand the game of baseball , and becoming a proficient player is difficultvery difficult . Natural physical gifting and innate athleticism are not predictors of baseball success . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest players , and the shocking reality is not the amazing size , strength , and speed of the game 's heroes , but the almost comical diversity of body type and physical ability . The game 's greatest players have been tall and short , skinny and fat , slow and fast , muscular and flabby , intelligent , and well , not so intelligent . But , they all have one thing in common ; every one of them developed the emotional capacity to persevere in the face of frequent , chronic failure and occasional humiliation . <p> If my suppositions are correct , what was once seen as a part of the glory of baseball , learning to persevere in the face of consistent failure , is now perceived to be a reason to avoid the game . Parents simply looking for ways to keep their children busy and happy will choose sports that do not include the pressure and individualized responsibility that baseball has always demanded . Baseball requires a kind of moral courage that keeps persisting in the face of inevitable repeated personal failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabrera and every little leaguer as well . Thus , baseball demands a huge time commitment for fathers , not simply in teaching and repetitively practicing the fundamentals of the game , but also calling sons to the kind of moral courage the game demands . Rarely ever will a boy persist in baseball if his dad has little interest in the game . As Diana Schaub avers in her essay " America at Bat , " " Without fathers , there is no baseball , only football and basketball . " <p> Baseball does not fit well with the current trend of sports leagues that do not keep score and where the goal is for everyone to be successful and know that they are always a winner . Such a notion does violence to a game that is structurally committed to constant reminders of the participant 's finitude and allows no room for such utopian fantasies . One of the reasons baseball has been so slow to embrace instant replay in the sport ( and rightly so ) is that a game marked by chronic managed failure propagates no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a baseball purist asserts , " Bad calls are a part of the game , " he is saying something about the warp and woof of the game . <p> Only genuine baseball fans understood the reaction of Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga during the 2010 baseball season when he was one out from throwing a perfect game ( there have only been 23 ) and veteran umpire Jim Joyce made one of the worst big moment calls in baseball history . Joyce , inexplicably , called the batter safe at first base . When the next batter was retired , Galarraga was saddled with the most disappointing one hitter in the history of the game . How did Galarraga respond to the injustice ? When it happened he offered a stunned grin and after the game he said , " He is human . Nobody 's perfect .... I want to tell him not to worry about it . " That moment was a beautiful window into what makes baseball unique . <p> No baseball player can survive and thrive without hope . When Henry Aaron was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would get two hits his reply was , " No . What I do know is that if I do n't get ' em today , I 'm sure going to get ' em tomorrow . " Babe Ruth was fond of saying , " Every strike gets me closer to the next home run . " Persistent , daily plodding in the face of chronic managed failure , driven by future hope sounds a lot like my daily Christian walk . <p> The Apostle the very thing I hate " ( Romans 7:15 ) . But he went on to write , " Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! ... There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus " ( Romans 7:25a , 8:1 ) . The reality of his persistent failure and limitations did not paralyze him because he knew his story fit into a larger picture of the story of Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for good , for those who are called according to his purpose " and those who love God are being conformed to the image of Christ ( Romans 8:28-29 ) . <p> As players prepare for Opening Day , every one of them knows perfection is impossible . No team will win 162 games ; no one will bat 1.000 , and no regular starting pitcher will go undefeated . Nevertheless , they practice with a sense of hope that this just might be their year . Despite their constant failure , if they keep stepping up to the plate and heading out to their position in the field , it all might work together for something special , and if not , there is always next year . <p> The very existence of another baseball season , another 162-game , seven-month exercise in hopeful , managed failure is a faint echo of the glorious promise James offers to all who have put their faith in @ @ @ @ @ " ( James 1:2-3 ) . Everyone has the tendency to compare the highlight reel of others ' successes to our daily failures and lose heart . But baseball , for those of us who love it , provides a constant reminder that everyone ( even the superstar ) strikes out , but the game still goes on . <p> Like most years , I think this just might be the year for my beloved Atlanta Braves to win it all . But whether they do or not , I am thankful that the chill of winter is giving way to spring and umpires will soon yell , " Play Ball !

Now I need your support and your comfort once again , we have another issue before us and before the country , and it is testing our moral fiber like no other . The new issue we face , together , the issue of AIDS . <p> What is it ? And what should we do about it ? So much has been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to go over it all again , instead , let me emphasize just a few key points from my own perspective as your Surgeon General . First , AIDS is a mysterious , contagious disease , it 's a virus , we 've seen it , we 've named it , we also know how it gets passed from person to person . It is passed either in blood or in semen , as a result , the disease has been most prevalent among homosexual and bisexual men and among drug abusers who borrow intravenous needles from other addicts who have AIDS . <p> Lately , however , AIDS has begun appearing in heterosexuals who are not drug abusers , apparently they contracted the disease through heterosexual relations with a carrier of the virus , and that 's a development of major concern . But having said all that , I must nevertheless tell you that science still does n't know the true nature of the AIDS virus , and until we do , we have no way of developing an effective vaccine against it . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victims is doubling every 13 or 14 months , as of a year ago , for example , we had had a total of 16,000 cases of AIDS reported to public health authorities since the first reports of AIDS were made back in June of 1981 . <p> Today that overall 5-year total is 30,000 cases , over half of those victims have already died of the disease , and the rest apparently will , by this time next year we will have added over 23,000 new cases of AIDS , and by the end of 1990 my colleagues in the public health service predict that a quarter of a million people will have contracted AIDS . <p> So we must be very clear about this disease in at least two respects : it is spreading among more Americans and it is killing more Americans as it spreads , the situation we have today is very much like the situation in Europe several centuries ago , when smallpox and the bubonic plague destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives and changed the course of history . I deeply hope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't happen , but we ca n't let that be decided by default , collectively as well as individually , we need to do things that have to be done . And right at the top of the list is need to become informed of what this threat really is . <p> That was what motivated president Reagan to direct me , back in February 1986 , to gather together everything we knew about AIDS and put it into a plain-English report to the American people , during the preparation of the report , I met with individuals and groups from across the spectrum of society , groups like your own Christian life commission the national council of churches the synagogue council of America and the national conference of Catholic bishops , the National Education Association , and the National P.T.A . And I talked with the National Coalition of Black and Lesbian Gays and the Washington Business Group on Health , 26 groups in all . <p> They were all extraordinarily candid , and each one also pledged -- as you did -- to help get my report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of listening and writing , I delivered my report to the cabinet and to the president , it was accepted and I released it on October 22 , 1986 . You may recall that my entire report is not very long , and I only devoted 92 words to the topic of education AIDS education in particular and sex education in general . But those 92 words have captured most of the attention of the media , of parents , of educators , and of public officials at all level of government , and I want to spend a moment or two talking about it . <p> The reason people have become so interested in my views on education is that the issue goes to the heart of each person 's own system of moral and ethical values , or lack thereof , I believe I introduced the subject in a straightforward way . I said in my report that , " education about AIDS should start in early elementary school and at home so that children can grow up knowing the behavior to avoid to protect themselves from exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an opportunity for parents to instill in their children their own moral and ethical standards . " Some people were unduly alarmed by that phrase , " early elementary school , " would that include kindergarten ? I 'm afraid so , I concluded the report with exactly the same thought , I said , " education concerning AIDS must start at the lowest grade possible as part of any health and hygiene program . There is now no doubt that we need sex education in schools and that it must include information on heterosexual and homosexual relationships . The threat of AIDS should be sufficient to permit a sex education curriculum with a heavy emphasis on prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases . And I would not change any of the words in that paragraph either . Sex education can and should be non-threatening . It can teach good values . It can help develop the child 's own sense of personal responsibility , and it can strengthen the concept of " the family . " <p> This kind of sex education should unfold according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of awareness and curiosity . I do n't see any reason to cling to a rigid schedule based on chronological age . If the curriculum is well-planned and thoughtfully carried out , then it will be possible to bring to the attention of the children the facts about sexually transmitted disease -- and AIDS in particular -- along about the junior high school years the years of early adolescence . If this makes us uncomfortable , if it is awkward to do , if it appears to conflict with other information we might have , those are problems that we , as adults , have to resolve in a way that enables us to nevertheless tell our children what they need to know and have a right to know . I 'm not saying it 's easy , but it 's far from impossible . <p> For example , in my report you will find two straightforward precautions , the first one is simple enough , it advises you to find someone who is worthy of your respect and your love , give that person both , and stay faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total abstinence , the best defense against AIDS is to maintain a faithful , monogamous relationship in which you have only one continuing sexual partner , and that person is as faithful as you are . <p> My second message is for people who do n't yet have a faithful , monogamous relationship for whatever reason , so this second message Is , proceed with extreme caution : it 's important that you know with absolute certainty that neither you nor your partner is carrying the AIDS virus , if you 're not absolutely certain , then you must take precautions , and the best one available -- though far from perfect -- is to use a condom from start to finish . <p> From my viewpoint , as a public health officer , I tell people that when they have sex with someone , they 're also having sex with everyone else with whom that person has ever had sex . This kind of information is clear enough and straightforward enough to tell children . There 's nothing terribly esoteric about it , and I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and teachers alike -- are having trouble coming to terms with it . <p> The more Ive thought about this phenomenon , the more Ive come to believe that the difficulty is not in the facts themselves concerning sexuality , human reproduction , and AIDS . Rather , the difficulty is in the significance of those facts relative to the totality of a sensitive and affirmative human relationship . Such a relationship will include some fulfilling sexual activity , but it is not defined only by that activity . There 's much more to a loving , caring , respectful , and tolerant human relationship than just " good sex . " A relationship devoid of love and responsibility is like a piece of pie that 's all crust and no filling , and young people ought to be advised of that . <p> Novelists call it " true love , " sociologists call it " marital fidelity . " The Surgeon General calls it " monogamy . " But whatever you call it , we all want that well-rounded , balanced , loving , and fully considerate relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by it or devoid of it either . Such a relationship is an ideal but " real life " is n't always like that . It 's imperfect , it 's give-and-take . Most grown-ups know and come to accept human imperfection , but children do n't , and wo n't , without a compassionate understanding of the imperfect nature of many human relationships , a child 's education will be , itself , very imperfect . <p> So if parents are to educate their children about human relationships -- sexual and otherwise -- they must first understand and accept . The nature of their own , for many , that 's hard to do , parents -- and adults in general -- are not very good about talking to each other about their sexuality . They feel frustrated , guilty , and even angry because they are unable to do the thing that . They know -- intellectually and emotionally -- they should do , but they just ca n't . And those feelings of frustration and guilt make it all the more difficult for them to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human relationship . <p> Nevertheless , I want parents to try . I want parents to do this with compassion , with respect and with love , and with some understanding not just of the child who 's listening , but also of the adult who is speaking . Still , it remains as my sincerest wish that the parents of this country will be the primary teachers of sex and human relations to the children of this country . I say that , knowing full well that many parents simply ca n't do it , but the task should not therefore be left , by default , to the movies , to television , or to the street-corner . We ca n't do that and still protect the millions of young lives that are at risk of AIDS . <p> Just as a kind of footnote , let me share with you just what children learn from the media . Some research was recently done by Michigan state university to see what kinds of sexual experiences children were exposed to through movies and television . The researchers found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8th-grade girls watch between 1 and 2 hours of soap operas every day after school . And what are they seeing ? The researchers report that , among other things , sexual intercourse between unmarried partners is shown or discussed on mid-day soap operas on an average of 1.56 times an hour . <p> In the evening , a larger number of 9th and 10th-grade girls and boys watch 3 to 4 hours of television , on those prime-time evening shows , acts of unmarried intercourse are shown or discussed on an average of once an hour . The same researchers also found that over 60 to 70 percent of those 9th and 10th-graders saw the top 5 " R " -rated films , in which sexual intercourse between unmarried partners occurred on the average of 8 times per film . In the worst films , it occurred 15 times . <p> This kind of research illustrates the fact that Americas children do n't live in a vacuum , and , therefore , we all must work together to help our children grow up and cope with the real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the compelling reason why our schools , churches , synagogues , and other community institutions must do whatever possible to provide our children with the best available information physical , sexual , emotional , and psychological to help them negotiate their own way through the human condition . I think in today 's world , which is run by a disappointing generation of adults -- children have a right to all the help they can get . <p> I 've been talking so far about some issues in the context of our fight against AIDS , but I believe that much of what needs to be done because of AIDS also needs to be done because of other difficult problems as well . For example , I mentioned earlier in my remarks the fact that we -- you and I -- have stood together in opposition to the spread of pornography in our society . I would have to say that nothing is a more powerful weapon against this disgusting material than the honest truth about human sexuality . That 's not the only answer , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily as that . <p> But I believe that a child who is given the facts about his or her own sexuality -- in a matter-of-fact yet caring manner -- is a child who will feel more secure as an evolving adult and will have only contempt for pornography . Similarly , I think of those million or so teen-age girls who have unwanted pregnancies each year , and I think about the 400,000 of them who resort to abortion and who plunge themselves and their families into such an abyss of personal tragedy , and I wonder how many of them might have escaped that fate , if their parents or teachers or clergy had told them about their own sexuality how important it was to understand it and make it a part of their lives , and not allow sexuality to take over their lives . <p> Yes , it is true , that we have ahead of us an enormous challenge in the form of the spreading and deadly disease of AIDS . And it is also true that the single weapon we now have available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more education , especially of our young people , ' who are so vulnerable . But we should be providing this information not only because of the threat of AIDS , we should be providing it because knowledge of human sexuality is a child 's best defense against many of the most grateful and exploitive phenomena of modern society -- and there are a great many , I 'm sorry to say . <p> This , then , is the message Ive been relaying to the American people since October 22 . Reduced to its essentials , the message has three parts : <p> First , if you do n't know what you 're doing , do n't  do it , abstain . This is the core of my message to young people , who are still in the process of learning about their own sexuality and who are not yet ready to assume all the responsibility that comes with a total human relationship . <p> Second , if you 're an adult and abstinence is not an acceptable alternative , your best possible defense against AIDS -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faithful , monogamous relationship . As Lee Iacocca might say , " If you 've got one keep it , if you do n't have one find it . " <p> And third , if you 're an adult who understands your own sexuality but you just have n't found that magical monogamous partner yet , then please be careful and , among other things , use a condom from start to finish . <p> Let me again emphasize that we 're talking about a disease that now threatens everybody , everywhere . It is no longer primarily a disease attacking the homosexual communities of San Francisco , Los Angeles , and New York City . It is now appearing in all 50 states and among heterosexuals , and that means the rest of us . I 've delivered this message -- and variations of it -- many times in the past few months , but it does n't get any easier . It 's essentially a grim message and I guess I 'm something of a grim courier . <p> My only hope is that every American who hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her part to stop the spread of AIDS ought to protect and save the lives of people at risk , including and especially our young people . And that they will help return sexuality back to its rightful place in the spectrum of human experience , have it again be a part of the total complex of human , caring , interpersonal relations . <p> Now , a final word . You , as Christians , will continue to be tested by tremendous questions that arise from the turmoil of current events , these questions make you examine and re-examine who you are and what you stand for . This is not an age for the faint of heart or of soul . One of those questions involves homosexuality . You ca n't avoid it if you 're going to discuss AIDS . If you regard homosexual behavior as sin , please remember that one of the fundamental teachings of Christianity has been to " separate the sin from the sinner . " You may hate the sin but you must love the sinner . And let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle , against a disease , not against people . <p> This is especially true when we consider the innocent victims of this disease : The wives of bisexual men , the spouses of IV drug users , the wives and husbands of promiscuous spouses . And I 'm afraid we must also count the babies born to IV drug users or otherwise infected mothers , they are being abandoned and are dying alone in hospital nurseries . They are the most innocent victims of all . When AIDS intrudes upon your own lives , please remember that the sick and the dying require our care and our compassion , no matter how the illness was contracted . <p> Thank you for your understanding and support in the years ahead , as in the years past . God bless each one of you . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> As a constitutional attorney who learned about the law from Justice Scalias opinions and writing and as a Christian attorney who is continually inspired by his convictional , passionate , well-lived life , the stakes for his successor could not be more high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core social principles at the center of our view of human flourishing .

@@100509532 @4709532/ <h> John Leland : How a Baptist preacher helped ensure religious liberty <p> I was recently travelling through Virginia and was amazed at the history that I saw at almost every turn . Driving on state highways from Fredericksburg to Monticello was like travelling in a time machine . First , we saw a sign marking the location where the legendary Confederate General " Stonewall " Jackson was accidentally shot by his own men , which resulted in the amputation of his left arm and eventually in his death because of pneumonia that developed in his recovery . Then we drove through the Civil War battlefields of Chancellorsville and the Wilderness . Markers along the highway indicated the location of various sites , including the home that served as General Robert E. Lees headquarters during the campaigns . As we made our way toward Thomas Jeffersons Monticello , we neared Montpelier , the home of James Madison . I had just finished telling my wife and kids about the role Baptists played in the guarantee of religious liberty in the first amendment of our Bill of Rights when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . I quickly pulled to the side of the road and led my family over to a monument commemorating John Lelands role in the crafting of the first amendment . <p> We have the first amendment , in large part , due to the efforts of American Baptists such as Isaac Backus and John Leland . Leland , a prominent Baptist preacher at the turn of the 19th century , had petitioned his Virginia legislator , James Madison , directly regarding his concern that more needed to be done to ensure religious liberty in the new country than the " Religious Test " clause of Article VI , paragraph 3 of the Constitution . Since Baptists represented a significant portion of the vote in Madisons district , Lelands threat to run for Madisons seat in the House of Representatives resulted in a visit by Madison to his home . Coming out of that meeting was a compromise that included Leland agreeing not to run for Madisons seat and Madison agreeing to champion Lelands and his fellow Baptists concern for religious liberty . Madison kept his word and pushed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political process , it is at least possible that the protection of religious liberty from Congress would not exist . <p> Baptists have historically defended the principle of religious liberty .

In the 16th century , the European Anabaptists opposed the use of the sword to mandate matters of the conscience . Seventeenth-century proto-Baptists such as Thomas Helwys ( in England ) and Roger Williams ( in Colonial America ) spoke directly to the governing authorities appealing for religious liberty . Baptists have always stood on the side of religious liberty for all . In fact , it was a group of Baptists in Danbury , Conn. , concerned about the infringement of the newly formed federal government upon the consciences of American citizens , to whom Thomas Jefferson responded in a letter with the famous expression of " separation of church and state " that has become such an important part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summary of the rights guaranteed in the first amendment that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .

@@100509537 @4709537/ <h> What Hath Buckley to Do with Barnabas ? A Reflection on Christianity and Conservatism <p> ( These remarks were delivered by Andrew Walker on the topic of " Christianity and Conservatism in the Public Square " during an event at Vanderbilt University . ) <p> I recall a friend , a prominent conservative , who told me that he became a Christian as a result of attending pro-life events and interacting with the pro-life community . Prior to this his political worldview had been one of stalwart conservatism . <p> Were more accustomed to hearing the opposite , that a persons evangelical or Catholic faith led him or her into the pro-life fold . <p> My friend wondered why the pro-life movement was predominantly faith-based , because , for him , the right to lifeand the need to protect the most vulnerable among uswas a self-evident truth grounded in a souls right to exist . " Thou shall not murder " was not just a principle carved into stone by Moses ; for my friend , it was also a natural truth that served as a fundamental tenet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Natural Lawthat life should be respectedwould ultimately lead him to ask whether there was a Supreme Law-Giver . The idea of Divine Truth unsettled his conscience , convincing him that the visceral concern he had for unborn life must spring from an eternal source . Soon after that he converted to Christianity , obviously for reasons of atonement given by Christ , but partly because he resonated so deeply with Christianitys scriptural and historic teaching on human dignity . <p> This friends story displays a fundamental relation between conservatism and Christianity : The two traditions have a resonating , shared anthropology , which , when speaking about deciphering worldviews , is a paramount doctrine upon which to have agreement . Both traditions believe that man is not a machine ; that in the act of creating us , God creates us for certain ends that result in human happiness . <p> Both traditions teach that humanity is " fallen , " or " imperfectible , " or " finite . " Where modern liberalism suggests that our nature and bodies are instruments of the will capable of being re-created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , according to Thomas Sowell , " constrained . " Both traditions acknowledge and celebrate limits . Christianity and conservatism both reject body-self dualisms found in contemporary ideologies , believing instead that the individual is not mere material , but also possesses a soul . <p> Contrast this with the world we now live in , a world described by Jennifer Roback Morse in Public Discourse as one that " promises health and happiness through science . Science is supposed to deliver human control over the constraints of nature . This , in turn , will make us happy , since the free exercise of our will is supposed to be the key to human happiness . " <p> In contrast , Christianity and conservatism alike have been suspicious of the unconstrained will ; knowing that the untrammelled pursuit of " progress , " untethered from moral norms , has resulted in moral atrocity and human misery . The forward march of liberalism has resulted in a conception of human freedom coupled with policies that leave an unintended path of human wreckage in their wake . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative traditionhas held that man is a political animal , Christianity complements this tradition by suggesting something further : That man is also a distinctly moral creature . <p> To be a creature is to admit that we are all created beings distinct from our Creator . To be moral suggests that there exists an enduring moral order to which humanity is obligated to align itselfnot for the sake of mere alignment itselfbut that such alignment produces human flourishing . <p> As a Christian , the language of " rights " so often spoken of by conservatives is what Francis Schaeffer referred to as " borrowed capital " concepts derived from Christianity that secular political philosophies accommodate in order to give meaning to governance . For individuals like Schaeffer or C.S. Lewis , if there were no God , there could still be observable rights or wrongsbut these rights and wrongs would be a result of emotive observations , suspended in air and created by what Oliver ODonovan calls " a vacuum of authority . " <p> However , to be a political animal is not to stand in contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept by suggesting that how we order our livesand were all ordering our lives whether we know itis an action accountable to God . <p> It is no surprise that some of conservatisms greatest thinkers have been Christians : men and women such as Edmund Burke , William F. Buckley , Whittaker Chambers , Robert P. George , Dorothy Sayers , Jean Bethke Elshtainindividuals like my friend Ryan Anderson . Even Russell Kirk , perhaps the greatest proponent of traditionalist conservatism , converted to Christianity later in life . And it was he who offered these words : " The conservative is concerned , first of all , with the regeneration of the spirit and characterwith the perennial problem of the inner order of the soul , the restoration of the ethical understanding , and the religious sanction upon which any life worth living is founded . This is conservatism at its highest . " <p> The reverse is also true , some of Christianitys most astute thinkers have likewise been conservativesfrom Francis Schaeffer , C.S. Lewis , G.K. Chesterton , Carl Henry , Abraham Kuyper , Allan Carlson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore . <p> But to say that much of conservatism has been Christian is not to say that all of conservatism is Christian . Some conservatives were Enlightenment Deistsmany of our founders , for examplewho spoke of owing their lives to " Divine Providence . " <p> I say that to say this : There is not to my knowledge a strong tradition of atheist conservatives . <p> The best of the conservative tradition recognizes that our political lives can not be lived merely in the penultimate ; and the best of the Christian tradition recognizes that a worldview shaped by the ultimate should inform and shape life in the penultimate ; that each tradition demands and advocates for human excellence and moral order in the midst of inhabiting bodies , souls and minds that are disordered and fallen . <p> My personal worldview flows downstream from my faith , a Christianity that demands the recognition of human dignity and the priority of the family , met with a conservatism that shares this worldview and puts these Permanent Things into action by promoting and defending them . 43169 @qwx903169 43177 @qwx903177 43180 @qwx903180 43186 @qwx903186

In what follows , I will use only the first four chapters of the book of Genesis to demonstrate that payday lending as it is practiced by most businesses today is an affront to man and God . Here are four reasons to oppose payday lending : <p> 1 . Human dignity . Genesis 1:26-27 tells us that humans are created in Gods image . In fact , humans are the only species mentioned in the creation account as being created in the image of God . While scholars are divided in their opinions of what this " image " is , they are agreed that it means humans share something of the divine not possessed by any of earths other creatures . That affords them a unique dignity by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that humans be treated as people of inestimable worth regardless of their social , economic , physical , or any other condition . The predatory activity involved in much of payday lending fails to respect the dignity of the person created in the image of God . It treats fellow humans as prey rather than fellow image-bearers . <p> 2 . Gods design . Gods expectations for humanity at creation were very high . The book of Genesis states that He gave humans authority over all creation as His stewards ( 1:26-31 ; 2:15 ) . They were in partnership with Him in tending to the needs of creation . The expectation was that they would work together to achieve this task . That calling still exists . We are still intended by God to play a part in the respectful stewarding of His creation . Adequately achieving that task requires a mutual beneficence among humans that empowers each person to fulfill his or her potential . The predatory practice of much of payday lending actually interferes with human flourishing . It holds some in a perpetual state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual benefit here . Not only do fellow humans suffer as a result , but Gods design for human stewardship of His creation is affected as this predation crushes people . <p> 3 . Human nature . It did n't  take long in the biblical narrative for humans to rebel against Gods plan for them . Chapter three of the book of Genesis describes humanitys rebellion against God . The result of their rebellion brought them separation from God and one another ( Gen. 3:7-19 ) . It produced a selfishness that saw fellow humans as objects to be used for personal gain rather than subjects with whom to enjoy rich , mutually beneficial relationships . Predatory payday lending represents some of the worst of fallen human nature at work . Greed for material gain is the ultimate value in this practice . Other humans are no more than objects for personal enrichment . <p> 4 . Social responsibility . Chapter four of the book of Genesis introduces us to Gods expectation of human social responsibility . After Cain has killed his brother Abel , God asks him where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " Am I my brothers keeper ? " ( Gen. 4:9 ) . The answer is so obvious that God does not even bother to answer . Cain was indeed his brothers keeper . Jesus developed this point further by reminding us that we are each others neighbors . As such we have a responsibility to assist each other ( Luke 10:30-37 ) . <p> There is no room for predatory behavior in Gods plan for human relationships . In fact , where this does occur in Scripture , God makes sure to eventually balance the scale . So , for example , the people of Israel plundered their Egyptian masters upon their departure from Egypt ( Exod. 3:21-22 ) . On a more universal level , God calls on people to be just in their business dealings with each other . He calls for just scales and fair prices ( Lev . 19:35-36 ; Prov. 11:1 ) . He denounces usurious lending practices on multiple occasions ( Exod. 22:25-27 ; Lev . 25:35-37 ; Neh. 5:1-13 ) . <p> God is not opposed to profit . Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But God is opposed to those who take advantage of the weak and vulnerable ( Exod. 22:21-24 ; Deut. 24:10-22 ; Zech. 7:8-14 ) . There is no other way to describe predatory payday lending than oppressive . Its very business model is based on the inability of the borrower to ever be free of his or her indebtedness . Business must operate with a heart if it is to be respected as a valued member of society . It must see itself deriving a reasonable profit because it contributes to the well-being of those it serves , not simply deriving as much profit as possible because it manages to plunder an unsuspecting public . <p> Chapter four of the book of Genesis also introduces us to part of the solution for dealing with predatory payday lending the civil magistrate . The chapter reveals Gods commitment to regulating broader human relationships . After God confronts Cain over his murder of Abel , he condemns him to a life of wandering . Cain complains that Gods punishment is too great . He fears that " whoever finds me will kill me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that He will exact a heavy penalty from anyone who kills Cain . In this interaction , we can see the seed of Gods institution of the civil magistrate . He is placing boundaries on how humans are to treat one another . <p> God instituted government to help humans live together in harmony . Even if humans were not fallen and sinful , we would still need government to help us organize our lives together . But because of our fallenness , government is essential . As the Apostle Paul states , governments task is to reward good and to punish evil ( Rom. 13:1-7 ) . The divinely ordained task of government is to help humans live within Gods moral standards . Government should not abuse this authority , but it must intervene at times . <p> Predatory payday lending exhibits all of the features that make government intervention necessary . Its business model elevates greed as the ultimate value . It devalues humans and puts the very economic system of free markets that have pulled more people out of poverty than any other system known to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being taken advantage of and treated as nothing more than cattle . When people fail to act responsibly toward each other , government is there to ensure the balance . <p> At times , people may need some emergency financial assistance . Those who make this type of service available are in a high-risk activity . Consequently , to cover their higher risks , they must charge a higher interest rate . But surely there must be a limit to this risk management . A lender should not be able to take advantage of a persons plight for predatory gain . Some reasonable regulations should be adopted that will ensure that lenders work within appropriate limits and that guarantee borrowers are not trapped in an endless debt spiral that drives them further into the poverty from which they are desperately trying to escape . 43169 @qwx903169 <p> This week the ERLC released a free , downloadable bulletin insert for use by your church on Anti-Gambling Sunday ( September 18 ) .
