@@96443346 @643346/ <p> I need to find a way to open the chat window automatically for users after their session connects . We use a tray application that allows users to start a support session on their own , and we would like them to be able to chat with us right away ( even before we connect to their session ) . Currently we display a message on their screen after the session is created that tells them to double click on the SC icon to start chatting now , however that does n't work if they end up connecting with the Java Client . <p> With the Java Client , you ca n't double click to open chat but you can right click to get a context menu , then open chat . I know it may seem trivial , but when you tell somebody to double click and it does n't work and then later try to explain to them that " sometimes you will need to right click , depending on whether or not the ClickOnce method fails and it ends up using Java , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just confusing to them . I thought of putting , " If you see a Java logo come up you will need to right click to get a chat window , and if it starts automatically then you will need to double click to open a chat window " on the message , but that just makes the program seem sloppy . <p> I would like to see one of the following : <p> 1 . A way to programatically open the chat window from my tray application ( like a command switch ) . 2 . A setting that allows us to choose whether or not the chat window starts minimized to the tray , or open ( I hate to compare SC to g2a , but their chat window opens automatically - Overall SC is MUCH better though ! ! ! ) 3 . I have been told that the Java client is different because of the different abilities that the two clients have ( some features are n't available in the Java client ) . That 's fine , but I would like to see them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , but the usability ( surely you can make both clients open the chat window in a similar manner ) . <p> A SIDE NOTE : <p> I do have to say that Screen Connect is the best remote support application I have found for a Managed Service Provider , or any technical support group for that matter . I have never seen such dedication to improve a product even after we have already payed for it . Most applications will go years without new features , and new versions are merely bug patches . Screen Connect adds new features ( big features ) every few months . I have worked at two different MSP 's over the last 4 years , and I have talked them both into replacing their remote support application with Screen Connect . With a product as great as Screen Connect it 's easy for me to put my neck on the line and tell upper management that they will not regret this purchase . Productivity increases , call times reduce , technicians are happier with it , and clients are happier that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with most remote support applications . I just had to get that in there as I do n't think I 've ever told you how great your product is , although I 'm sure you 've heard it before . <p> First thanks for the nice words about the product , always great to hear people are enjoying the product . <p> Now onto your issue . <p> 1 . I am going to move this over to advanced customization to see if anyone in our development team or maybe the community has some tricks for you on programmatically opening the chat on customer end maybe through a command line or toolbox item . <p> 2 . With Java there are sometimes tools that we use with our default clients that just do n't exist . Or maybe they do but its very convoluted to try and make them work as they should . But I will add this request to see what we can do . <p> * Also I would recommend reaching out to our team support/sales to see why your customers are getting the Java based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option , but the . exe or even our . exe that is deployed JRE would all give you the capability you described above . It would be interesting to us what OS/Browser/Environment lead to the other client being deployed . Possibly there is something we can do to make sure most/all Windows customers are getting the same behavior . <p> Hmmm , I believe you could use a trigger to send a generic welcome message or something . That would make the chat window appear , and it can be done quite simply with the url : your SC LONG ... <p> ( I guess another option would be to just change your message from " double click " to " right click and select either ' Open ' or ' Chat ' " ; I do n't think that sounds too sloppy . ) <p> The trigger you want might be this , but even if it is n't , you can add a secondary SMTP action to your trigger and it will mail you every time it 's tripped.Event.EventType = ' Connected ' AND Connection.ProcessType = ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to authenticate as well . I suspect that 's the problem , though I 've had some trouble testing it myself ; I 'll have to look into that some more next week . <p> There 's a way to add credentials to a trigger action , but it was kind of an afterthought and is n't very polished . If you edit SessionEventTrigger.xml under AppData , you can add UserName= " username " Password= " password " as attributes to the TriggerAction element , though I believe you 'll have to restart the services for it to take effect , and it 'll be overwritten if you save from the UI . You 'll also have to add a parameter to the url : LONG ... <p> Another option , I believe , would be to just send the credentials in the url itself : LONG ... base64credentials is username : password encoded in base64 and then url-encoded . <p> Thanks I have tried this and many variants and nothing in the url field seems to do anything . <p> If I manually go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd then it works . <p> If I put the url into another trigger configured to send an email then when I get the email the url is formatted correctly . I can copy and paste if from the email into a browser and it sends the message to the correct session . <p> If I paste the link into chrome ( so I am not logged into my site ) I get this error ... <p> Exception rethrown at 0 : at **41;0;TOOLONG in LONG ... 91 at LONG ... result ) in LONG ... 120 <p> So what does it not like ? <p> This is my url in the trigger ( with the credentials and domain name changed .... <p> I just realized that the host page processes commands in client-side javascript , so going to that url outside of a browser or something is n't very helpful . But you can call the same thing it does from a trigger:URL : LONG ... POSTContent Type : application/jsonBody : " All Sessions " , " Session.SessionID " , 45 , " Session started " ( 45 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going wrong , but I know a couple ways to get a better idea of what the triggers are doing:You can see what the trigger is sending by running this command on a Linux machine and pointing the trigger to that machine 's port 9000 : while true ; do netcat -l 9000 -w 1 ; echo ; echo ; done ; You can test hitting the url without using the trigger with something like curl or this Chrome app ( making sure you 're logged out of ScreenConnect ) . <p> 9000 is just an arbitrary number there ; the important part is that the command and the trigger specify the same port . <p> I do n't believe there 's a log , though we could look into adding one . I would n't say this is a problem with triggers in general , mostly just with using them to interact with web APIs like this , but I do agree that it 's a significant one . ( The lack of documentation is more of an issue with our web API , and we 're planning on addressing that soon. )

Hopefully the following information will help clear up any confusion . <h> The types of stuff vendors try to pass off as remote support : <p> 2 Way Chat <p> Pushing Configuration Profiles <p> Mobile Dashboard View <p> Screen Captures <p> Use mobile device as controller <p> View system information ( no editing ) <h> Controller vs Controllee <p> Most all mobile operating systems can act as the controller , where the mobile device is used by technician to control computers or other mobile devices . Vendors creating a controller app must create the app , go through the app store submission process , and then maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big two , iOS and Android , with some tools providing support for other mobile operating systems . <p> Acting as the controllee is the difficult part . Very few mobile operating systems can actually be controlled . Restrictions put in place by the OS or the device manufacturer often limits what capabilities vendors can provide . <h> What constitutes " Support " ? " Control " ? <p> Even when a vendor advertises the ability to Control or Support a device , this is often a loose interpretation of remote support . They often confuse terminology or blatantly try to mislead customers that their apps can control mobile devices , while the app typically falls short of that goal . True remote support should provide : <p> The ability to see what is displayed on the device 's screen regardless of what application is active . <p> The ability to send touches and other input to the device regardless of what application is active . <h> Apple iOS : Forget it Apple Says No <p> It is currently against the terms and conditions of Apple for apps on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone , or iPod devices . The limitations primarily come down to the use of public versus private APIs . The public API Apple provides does not provide access to the necessary permissions , and apps trying to bypass this are not allowed on the iTunes store . <h> The nitty-gritty technical details <p> As of November 2013 , no public API exists for obtaining screen captures . A slew of private APIs exist that can accomplish the general task ( most notably UIGetScreenImage ) , but they are off-limits for anything in the App Store . <h> Will Apple relent ? <p> Who knows , there are a lot of organizations out there that would love to have this capability . Apple is probably receiving constant requests from users , IT managers , and vendors who would like to have more control over the devices they use . <p> The current direction Apple promotes for non-standard app deployment is their Enterprise provisioning and MDM programs . Each provides methods for achieving part of the ultimate goal but not a true remote support solution . <h> What will ScreenConnect do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our team has played with iOS for a while and if an approved method becomes available we will certainly provide a solution . <h> The edge cases <p> Yes , you can control jailbroken devices . Private APIs in enterprise-deployed apps can provide some capability . There are options for connecting devices to computers directly or through Airplay for some viewing options . Each of these methods are sketchy at best and not a solid structure for establishing a support model . <h> Somewhat misleading claims you may have seen <p> There are several online statements or websites that we are asked about frequently , so we have addressed each to help resolve any confusion . <p> " With BOMGAR- , support representatives can support Apple iPhone , iPad and iPod touch devices to help remote users resolve issues and configure settings . " <p> That sounds promising ... But farther down the page : <p> " Full remote control of iPad , iPhone or iPod touch is in violation of Apple terms and conditions . BOMGAR- continues to monitor the situation and is prepared to offer the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sanctioned method is made available .

But each of these companies would probably have an app to control iOS devices if Apple permitted . <p> Plenty of other press releases and product pages from less reputable companies have promised full control of iOS devices , but trust us , they all come with major pitfalls : they require the device to be jailbroken , the device has to be hooked to a computer , or the functionality is far less impressive than the marketing department would have you believe . <h> Android : Support is Sparse <p> Android , like iOS , is pretty locked down by default . The necessary permissions are locked so that , out-of-the-box , only Google can access what is required to provide true remote support . But there is a light ahead for Android . <h> The manufacturers hold the keys ( literally ) <p> Android remote control requires each remote support vendor to work with each device manufacturer to enable the control . Each support vendor provides an Android package for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This seems daunting : dozens of remote support vendors each forging agreements with dozens of Android manufacturers adds up to hundreds of agreements . Fortunately , the issue is somewhat mitigated by market share of the various device manufacturers . While there are dozens of players , a small handful controls 80-90% of the market . <h> Samsung sees the light <p> You 've seen the ads , but Samsung 's multi-million dollar marketing push for business is n't all fluff . They 've actively worked with remote support vendors ( among other app vendors ) to provide the ability to do " real stuff " with their devices . <h> Who supports what ? <p> This table provides a quick view of what we can find online about the major Android device manufacturers and which of our competitors have remote support capability . TeamViewer provides some support for a few manufacturers who did not make our list because of their market percentage . <p> Samsung ( 63.3% ) <p> HTC ( 6.5% ) <p> LG ( 5.9% ) <p> Sony ( 5.6% ) <p> Motorola ( 5.0% ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X <p> X <p> X <p> BOMGAR- <p> X <p> TeamViewer <p> X <p> GoToAssist <p> X <h> What will ScreenConnect do ? <p> We 're working with any device maker who will work with us . Everything is built ; they just need to sign it . We are more than happy to partner with any device manufacturer , feel free to contact our team if you would like to discuss further . <h> The nitty-gritty technical details <p> Remote control requires two permissions for an Android application : READFRAMEBUFFER to capture the screen , and INJECTEVENTS to control the device . That sounds fairly straight-forward , until reading the annotation in the preceding links : Not for use by third-party applications . The two permissions are defined with a protectionLevel of signatureOrSystem , which means only the device manufacturers can grant access . <h> The edge cases <p> Roots , custom roms , and third party OEMs can enable this . ScreenConnect works with this stuff and so do others . But do n't expect to run into much of it in the wild . <h> Updates <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . As of Lollipop release ScreenConnect can now view the screen of all Android devices we have tested running at minimum that version of Android OS . <h> The Rest : Windows Phone , Blackberry , etc . <p> Windows and Blackberry are each making some headway in the market through acquisitions and partnerships . A lot of companies talk about remote support functionality for both . But in the fine print , they are referring to the older versions of these OSes : " Windows Phone " and " Blackberry " could each be referring to about 5 different versions , as each manufacturer has totally broken with their past OS at least once ... if not more . <p> The summary is that currently both operating systems are pretty locked down similar to Android and iOS . Few vendors are actively trying to find loopholes around this because of their current market shares , but if they continue to make headway that could change . <p> Update : ScreenConnect is working on releasing a Windows mobile version of the techncian app . This should launch in conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a lot of misconceptions about what is available in terms of remotely viewing and controlling mobile devices . Confusing marketing statements , terminology variations , and consumer expectations have compounded the issue . Below , we have compiled information that should help with general market capability and that of ScreenConnect . <p> 01 <p> Can anyone view or control an iOS device ( iPad , iPhone , etc ) ? <p> No , the ability to view and control an iPhone , iPad , or iPod Touch is not permitted by Apple . The necessary permissions are secured at a level only available to Apple , and there is no indication they will change this policy . We constantly monitor resources for changes to their policy and if ever available we will do our best to provide support . <p> 02 <p> Can Android devices be controlled ? <p> The Android operating system has similar restrictions as iOS . However , each device manufacturer has the ability to provide access to the necessary permissions . ScreenConnect has partnered with Samsung to provide full remote support and is involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming , and healthcare system support are all areas where we have partnered with other organizations to provide remote support and access capability . We are always happy to work with new organizations , you can learn more on our OEM Integrations page . <p> 05 <p> What about other mobile operating systems ? <p> We are investigating options to provide support for Windows and Blackberry systems both from a host and guest perspective . <p> Would you like to ask your Vendor to partner with ScreenConnect ?

If i use the internal IP-address everything works . Could this be a Firewall issue ? <p> When we see this error it 's commonly caused by a firewall . Since the internal IP address works just fine , it sounds like you need to update the port-forwarding/NAT on the router/firewall to allow traffic on ports 80 and 443 to reach the ScreenConnect server . <p> The actual process for this varies by router type , but a general overview can be found here .

I have been tied up implementing some new clusters and this dropped off my radar for a while . <p> The main reason I was asking for SQL has to do with the fact that we use SQL server rather than SQLLite . What we ran into is essentially that some of the UI quieries appear to scan the full tables so having allowed them to grow created some timeouts and response issues . At one point the users complained that the systems seemed frozen so I restarted the services , and at that point they took a very long time to start . <p> For now I worked around the problem by doing some manual cleanup and regenerating indexes/stats . My concern is that since we disabled the cleanup process because the company wanted to keep ' all ' history , we will see this problem again in the near future . I spoke with support at one point , but since we are not using SQLLite they could not help us directly . They did suggest that a ' newer ' version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we built so we upgrade ' slowly ' rather than frequently . <p> In any event in reply to your questions:1 - Server is a VM running under Hyper-V .

This has drastically reduced the database-loading related issues we were seeing , especially during startup . I can not say definitively whether this change would also improve SQLServer integrated installations , however . <p> Basically we are looking to delete everything in the database related to sessions and Activity that exceeds 90 days of age . What I had done originally was configure the Database cleanup so that all of the first six categories removed data after 90 days . I left the last two relating to captures disabled because we archive capture recordings externally through a separate process . <p> Since the cleanup process did not seem to work against SQL server , I was looking for SQL statements that could perform the same task .

@@96443386 @643386/ <p> I 'm not sure if this has been mentioned anywhere else yet .

First time was some months ago , and I had to manually re-connect to each unattended machine and re-install the agent.Ended up losing some of those connections . <p> And I 've just had to move the ScreenConnect server yet again . Except this time it was a completely painless process . So , I 'd like to share this important tip , and make this very clear . <p> 1 . Copy your backed up ScreenConnect installation folder over . <p> 2 . Download and install the appropriate ScreenConnect version and install over it . <p> 3 .

Is it as simple as changing the ScreenConnect I 'd in the registry ? <p> So , I do have an experiemental method that has had success in the past with similar migrations , it basically changes the cloud instance 's asymmetric key to that of your on-premise install . Then you update the on-premise install to change the location to where client 's callback and push out a reinstall to each client . As each client processes the reinstall , it is repointed to the new cloud instance which accepts its asym key . Again , though , it 's highly experimental and I can not guarantee results . If you 're interested , shoot an email to our Support team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 'll find it 's way up to me . <p> Alternatively , you could just place an Access client installer into your server 's toolbox and then use the Run Tool option on the Host page to execute it on each remote machine .

You can mask your thumbprint if you want ... <p> MyKE , here is the output below . After thinking about it a little more , I decided that I 'm going to leave the website on 443 and the relay on 80 . I did n't want to have to deal with firewall issues . In addition , since I 'm using Amazon 's free tier server , I do n't believe I can get an extra public IP ( perhaps I 'm wrong on that ) . My solution was to use another webpage with an embedded iframe . Therefore , you can have a user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good to go . <p> When using redirect do I need to have the web server listening on port 80 to redirect the traffic to port 443 so it uses the secure connection or can I use port 8040 and then redirect those requests ? <p> I recently changed our ScreenConnect server to use an SSL cert and bound it to port 443 . When we try to connect using support.1234.com it wo n't connect unless you add the Https : to the URL . I want to set it up to redirect to the Https port so clients do n't have to enter the complete URL when they connect . Currently I have the relay on 80 . <p> Here are the three lines from my web.config showing the current port configuration . <p> It 's good to see that this thread has taken a turn toward redirecting all traffic to HTTPS . At the start of this thread ( about three years ago ) it was a common assumption that there was no benefit to encrypting the Guest page . In 2010 , Firesheep taught us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page will ensure that the user name and password will be sent securely . However , it 's more complicated than that . When a user logs into their ScreenConnect account , the server responds with an ASPXAUTH cookie that stays on the user 's computer for one year ( or until they clear their cookies ) . That ASPXAUTH cookie is sent back to the server on every subsequent request , and it authenticates the user so they do n't have to reenter their user name and password every time they return to the site . Firesheep demonstrated that these types of cookies could be hijacked when sent or received over unsecured connections , for example HTTP connections over open Wi-Fi networks , allowing the hijacker to impersonate the cookie owner . Granted , this does not allow the hijacker to collect the password of the user , but it does allow them to , in many ways , act as if they had . In the case of ScreenConnect , the hijacker could manage and modify sessions , build installers , manage sessions groups , etc. , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current one . <p> Of course , none of this is a problem when all traffic is performed over HTTPS , but if a user makes an HTTP request to that domain , the browser will send the ASPXAUTH cookie in plain text . Consider the following scenario : <p> A user goes to their ScreenConnect site for the first time on a laptop , and clicks the Login link . <p> They 're redirected to the HTTPS URL of the Login page , and they login . <p> The server 's response includes the ASPXAUTH cookie , and the browser stores the cookie for one year . <p> The user takes his laptop to a location with an open Wi-Fi connection like a coffee shop or airport . <p> They use their browser bookmark that takes them to the HTTP home page of their ScreenConnect site . <p> At this point , they have broadcasted their ASPXAUTH cookie to every other user on the open Wi-Fi connection , one of which maybe running a malicious process to capture unsecured credentials and session information . <p> To make matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect to its HTTPS URL , if the user accesses that Login page over HTTP first , it 's already too late . The browser has already sent the ASPXAUTH cookie before the redirection . The damage is done . <p> Thankfully , the internet community has developed a standard to thwart this threat , and most browsers already include support . It 's called HTTP Strict Transport Security ( HSTS ) , and it instructs browsers to immediately redirect certain domains to HTTPS before it ever sends a request . <p> I would verify the firewall rules . We implemented the same redirect . IT had allowed the appropriate ports through the corporate firewall , but the ports were not allowed through for the Windows Firewall on the server itself . Sorry , should n't assume you 've installed ScreenConnect to a Windows machine , but for us , I need to be sure the ports were allowed on the inbound rules for the web server and relay . <p> NAT Reflection issue maybe ? We just moved from Digital Ocean on Ubuntu 14.04 where we had setup the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once moved to EC2 with Windows 2012 , the vm is behind a firewall ( likely with 1:1 NAT I suspect ) and now none of the above solutions work for redirection . I do n't get why , if its a redirect , the server even cares about the return path into port 443 . Because , if I am not mistaken , an http redirect header would simply tell the browser to " go elsewhere " . I have n't looked into the tcp conversation , so , do n't really know , just a hunch that the return trip breaks if firewall does n't handle it on some NAT 's . <p> When I was testing , I noticed if I used the server 's browser open to " localhost " , it would redirect correctly into the HTTPS connection at the correct URL even . The local server IP is internal on the EC2 network , not the public IP where the URL points . However , using a public URL at the public IP , redirection fails . And it does this on the server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that seems to be fine . From the EC2 server browser , If I disable all the addition config and leave only port 80 listening , Firebug will show responses correctly to the public IP and port 80 . Same if I switch it to HTTPS and 443 , works correctly . So I know ports are working either way , directly , both on server and externally . However , if I leave out any of the BaseUrlRedirectionModule , but do leave the **27;579;TOOLONG , port 80 will not work externally . Only opening localhost:80 or localhost:443 will work on the server , no external . Something is odd . I am not sure how **27;608;TOOLONG is intended to work , I am just assuming it would make the web service listen on the alternate port , even if through firewalls . <p> I have carefully followed the instructions posted on this forum and i 'm still having issues . On some computers it seems to be forwarding correctly , while on others i have to go to my site and manually enter HTTPS : // .... only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward correctly . FYI I am using GoDaddy to forward my subdomain , to the IP address of my Windows 2012 R2 server <p> hopefully this is n't a necro post , but I have followed these guides ... and for some reason when trying to go to http : //fqdn of screen connect server I get a " this page requires authentication popup " and the page does not redirect . <p> My ssl I believe is setup properly because going to https : //fqdn works just fine . <p> The redirector appears to be trying to do something ... as if I remove all changes back to stock and goto http : //fqdn the page displays properly . <p> Any ideas ? I am on the current stable version **26;637;TOOLONG <p> yes I used TCPView to show the ports being used , it looks like maybe Windows 2012 r2 is using it internally ... I looked at some guides to solve that , but it looked like more trouble than it was worth , so I just created a subdomain on one of our many domain names to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have clients use that instead of reminding them to put an s in after the http lol . <p> This is an old thread , is the solution for HTTPS redirection still valid for the 5.4 code base ? What happens when SC is upgraded , are these changes lost ? This really ought to be an official option available under Admin . <p> Can someone put the instructions for HTTP to HTTPS Redirect on the ScreenConnect Help site , so we know what the supported and up-to-date procedure is ? <p> Also , since HTTP to HTTPS redirection is a feature that 's pretty standard with most secure software and websites , it should be a simple checkbox in the Admin section rather than having to edit config files . Please look at incorporating into a future version . <p> Why would you only redirect the host page ? The whole point ( in my opinion ) is that you want the credentials passed at the login screen to be secure so they do n't go over HTTP . I setup my SC install similar to what you wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . I understand why you would not want guests to have to be SSL , but I do n't see an alternative to getting the login screen HTTPS unless you do every page SSL . Can you comment and clarify ? <p> Agreed . We also want to secure the site and not have to struggle with customers getting them to get the https : // typed in over the phone . The solutions proposed are overly complicated for feature that should be a pre-baked into the solution . It 's far easier to set this up on another server running IIS or Apache and have it redirect to the SSL url and I 'm more confident it will work the next time we update screenconnect . <p> Just hoping **25;665;TOOLONG has something in the works for the future that makes this easier . <p> Originally Posted by : kingbear2 <p> Originally Posted by : mmcnetsupport <p> I have ScreenConnect setup to only redirect the Host page for technicians .

I understand why you would not want guests to have to be SSL , but I do n't see an alternative to getting the login screen HTTPS unless you do every page SSL . Can you comment and clarify ? <p> It does require a second public IP address on the server ( we 're running ScreenConnect on an Ubuntu VPS on Vultr ) so the relay can be on port 443 as well as the main site and so port 80 can be open to redirect to the secured site with a 301 redirect ( if you 're OK using a relay on a non-standard port I think you can use a single IP still ) . We 're using LetsEncrypt to issue the certificate for our Nginx proxy , so that 's free at https : //www.letsencrypt.org and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Qualys SSL Labs test at https : **26;692;TOOLONG to get a grade of A on the site once this has been implemented successfully . <p> Additionally , we 've used these instructions to enable HSTS ( HTTP Strict Transport Security ) for our domain : LONG ... This means web browsers that support HSTS will never even try the insecure versions of the site once they 've visited the secure site once and seen that header ( until the timeout ; 180 days is required for Qualys to give you credit for it ) . Obviously be very sure your main domain and all subdomains do NOT need HTTP anywhere before setting this : - ) We 're using a dedicated domain for our ScreenConnect instance so this should n't be an issue . <p> With the Nginx proxy configured and HSTS enabled , Qualys gives us an A+ rating for security ! It may not be for everyone but if security is your thing or your customers thing , it may be a worthwhile investment of mostly time , especially if you 're on a Linux server already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second public IP ( which is the only thing that might cost actual money ; Vultr charges $2/mo for a second one ) , since LetsEncrypt is free . From $7/mo to $9/mo is only $24 per year for much , much better security . <p> I 'm a new ScreenConnect customer on 6.1 and could n't get it working with these instructions . Has anyone tried it on 6.1 ? I tried tech support , but they referred me to this forum . I 'm not technically savvy , but I can follow simple instructions . Any advice ? <p> 4 . Create a subdirectory of your ScreenConnect folder called " AppCode " and create a new text file in there , naming it HttpsRedirectModule.cs . Open that file in Notepad and paste in the following and save it : <p> * You define a base URL that you redirect from ... this can contain wildcards . But it really should include enough of the trailing path to " match " correctly . Meaning " http : //localhost* " is not good , but " http : //local*/ " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't really know where the base URL ends . Then you define a URL to redirect to . This does n't contain wildcards . The portion that was " matched " from the redirect from will be replaced by this value . <p> This thread is from quite some time ago . Frankly I 'm surprised at why no one has recommended what appears to me to be the easiest solution . <p> 1 ) Install IIS <p> 2 ) Configure HTTP redirect on the " Default Web Site " as per the screenshot below : <p> We did this on our test install ( not live yet , but we plan to go live soon - migrating from an old Server 2008R2 install ) , opened both port 80 and 443 , and everything seems to be working well .

@@96443420 @643420/ <p> New to Screen Connect . Not a tech wizard by any means , but I can usually figure stuff out . However I 'm trying to discover the best practice and easiest setup to provide employees remote access to their computers using screen connect . We are leaving logmeIn and have installed a on premise screen connect server .

@@96443422 @643422/ <p> I am wondering if anyone uses the messages tab on an unconnected Guest session to chat with their clients . We currently have a trigger set up to email a group mailbox if a guest sends in a chat message to an unconnected session . This way all of our engineers will be notified someone is trying to chat with us for support through the SC client . The problem is , it is useful sometimes for us to use the messages tab on our SC website to chat with a customer before we remote in to help them out . When this is done by a tech the trigger sends out an email to our group mailbox for every guest message response , which of course spams all our engineers . It would be great if SC could recognize an active chat session in progress and disable the email trigger . <p> @redwills24 I implemented a change to the Extension to address this issue . Basically , it will only send the auto response once every x number of minutes so that you can chat from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said , I 'm holding off until 5.5 is stable to publish the Extension because it contains another addition which will create the Event Trigger dynamically , something that was added in 5.5 . <p> what extension was changed , We are using the event trigger the same way and we get the same email notifications unless a technician ( host ) connects to the guest and chats . Is there anyway to prevent the trigger from sending the email if a screenconnect user logged into the console is chatting using the screenconnect web console ? <p> So when a guest types a message in the chat window and does n't have a host connected , we get an alert email , which is what we want . However if a host is logged in and intiates a chat through the screenconnect web console chat option w/out joining the guest session , and the guest responds to that chat , we also get an alert email , which is what we do n't want . <p> Yes , knowing the syntax helps . What this comes down to is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process events based upon information specific to the event that triggered it . What you 're looking for here is to add an additional operator to the filter to basically specify not to execute if a Host has sent a message within the last x minutes ( or something similar ) . <p> Now , it is still possible to implement the functionality you want via an Extension . Basically you would define a dynamic session event trigger within the Extension instead of from the Trigger 's tab on the Administration page .

Adding the Deny function creates some security paradoxes that can not be fully solved and may lead to compliance issues .

@@96443432 @643432/ <p> It has n't been until recently that we 've been using ScreenConnect to support Macs , so I do n't know how long this issue has been around . We 've noticed that when connected to a Mac , the Host 's keyboard will only be able to type the letter ' a ' on the guest 's Mac . It seems to happen randomly because I 've been connected for 30 minutes before this was a problem , but my coworker had the same problem on a different Mac shortly after connecting to the session . When the problem starts , you can tap any of the keys on the Host machine , but on the mac it will show up as just a bunch of ' a ' letters . <p> Strange , I ca n't say that I 've seen other reports of this exact behavior . <p> Are both Guest and Host clients running the latest 5.6 in addition to the server ? You can check on both sides from the Information control panel in their respective client applications . <p> Also , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications ? <p> What version of Java is installed on these OSX machines ? <p> Yes , on both sides they 're running the same version as the server . It does n't look like I mentioned this , but the issue comes up in Support and Access sessions . <p> Yes , it passes only the letter ' a ' to wherever the cursor is on the guest machine . <p> I 'm not sure about the Java version for the Macs that we 've connected to . We received a Mac back , so I 'll try doing some testing on that . <p> Honestly , the machines we support are 99% Windows based , and we rarely connect to Macs . Usually we 're connecting to Macs because it 's the employee 's personal machine that we help setup with remote access . It has only been recently that we started doing this , so I 'm unsure how long this problem may have existed . <p> Through a brief discussion at our stand-up meeting this morning , I 've learned that two other developers have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue as a defect and we will continue to investigate . <p> I 've seen this behavior too , but only since upgrading to version 5.6.10957.6018 and with a unique twist . It only happens when I am typing in any program that is running on a virtual machine running Windows 10 on the Mac that is the guest . Any character pressed types as the letter " a " . Typing in any program on the iMac ( not on the virtual machine ) types normally . <p> Experiencing this issue on MAC servers running 10.10.5 and 10.12 can screenconnect ok. but when you try to VNC / Remote to another machine within the client network getting accent'ed keys pass through not clear type.Connect to Client MAC via screen connect working.ARD / Safari to remote manage no keyboard pass through.On computers have also turned off accented keys in terminal but issue still presentshave change keyboard types to US from local to see if any change still none . <p> have tried from Windows10 as localhost and MAC 10.10.5 screen connect to Server Mac 10.10.5 / Server Mac 10.12.0 then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.101 on all clients and back to older version 7 no change . <p> Have escalated a ticket to Development - as support do not have an answer .

@@96443435 @643435/ <h> Answer <p> @Christoph - The Host Pass feature is the fix for your issue . The host pass should be generated for the machine being serviced and passed to your external user . The Host ( external user ) when connected to a session with a Guest ( internal user ) without Admin permissions would need to send a CAD at the beginning of the session to elevate : LONG ... Any UAC prompt that appears before this happens would have to be cleared by the Guest or the Host would have to wait for UAC to timeout ( 120s , i think ) . Your suggested method technically skirts our licensing model , so it is doubtful that we 'd give host privileges to guests in a reverse screenshare . <p> We use screenconnect basically " the other way around " .

I can either see the input window , but my key strokes do not get transmitted , or I ca n't see the UAC window at all . Being able to do something with those windows - without having to have someone sitting in front of the remote machine to do that - would be very usefull . <p> I tried the feature you mentioned , but even when using a Host pass , after changing the viewing direction I can still not enter any credentials into the UAC window . <p> Sorry for the late reply - Corys comment notification seems to have been missed .

In our workplace we use a similar method that we 've adapted to work with screen connect .

Having the one off support session converted into an access session right from my screen connect window would be fantastic .

Otherwise , the installed client would show out of date and we would perform a follow up step of " Re-Install " once it 's listed . <p> Instead of putting the installers into your toolbox , why not put a quick batch file to install the client via msiexec and the URL to the client ? I believe that the URL stays the same when updating to a new version . All you have to do is copy the URL that downloads one of the installers , change the **26;1257;TOOLONG for each organization and put " msiexec /i http : **28;1285;TOOLONG ... " in a batch file . <p> I wrote a quick PHP script that makes the URLs easier to manage at this post . <p> For mac and linux clients , I just wrote a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directory , where I launch it manually . Not perfect , but still pretty streamlined . <p> Any talk about adding a simple one click button that would convert a Support Session to an Access session ? Most of the time I end up installing an Access session on my customer computers anyways . Having one built and added to the tool menu is great but I like neatness and having everything labeled and having a default Access file means I have to go in and label the Access so I know who 's computer it is . Then I have to End the Support session . Sure , after a while it can become second nature and all these steps could be done in a very short minute ... but why make someone repeat these steps all the time ? Just give us a button that does it for us . Time is money and honestly I am tired of performing the steps over and over again when I believe an easier way is possible . <p> How it would work is ... <p> 1 . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Access session instead . So I click on the " More button " under " Host " and click on " Convert to Access session " and bam . Simple . Easy . Intuitive . Done . <p> We have primarily worked to make this easier to do from the toolbox . For example there is a new extension in 5.0 that does an API call to launch ability to download unattended client from Guest page or actually launch the build installer from Guest page . So the idea was this would help or possibly a toolbox item that did the same thing . <p> So steps today would be to click toolbox and then click on the unattended client to launch and execute on the Guest Side . But it requires you keeping the unattended client updated . <p> With updated API a tool could probably be built and put into toolbox to resolve the part of needing to always keep the client updated . I will have to check with team to see if we have anything we have created yet . <p> Not that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could save a lot of button clicks between menu item in Misc dropdown that user clicks to transfer/install unattended . Versus opening toolbox dropdown and clicking on it there . Now I know you have raised some concerns on speed of toolbox to load so that might be a reason this model would n't be ideal . <p> I will make sure we talk about this some more . But your feedback on why toolbox is n't a good resolution would be very useful in my conversation with development .

Let us know what you find ! <p> There is a slight improvement when I use " RelayAddressableUri " the pop-up screen on the guest now says assist.acron.biz:443 . The window title and tray pop-up status alternates between Connecting and Negotiating . Messages sent is one and messages received says 0 <p> Ok , it is communicating with the correct address . I think your firewall is messing with the relay connection now . The firewall needs to forward the traffic directly without any http proxy mess or any other packet inspection . I 'm not sure how to do this with your device , but we 'd be glad to give it a look if you call into our support line . <p> I 've some testing and I suspect it has to do with the VirtualHost settings in the Apache configuration on my SMEServer gateway .

First prize would be to know what exact settings to use inside the VirtualHosts directive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the option of abandoning apache and linux . I use a popular and very good linux distribution SmeServer ( contribs.org ) . They do have a good community so I can also ask there for help . But I would need to know what question to ask . As you can from above the gust now gets the correct address . So I would expected it to work now , except it does n't and I can not tell why . <p> What I am trying to achieve is get ScreenConnect to use ports 80/443 . Several of my prospective guests have outbound blocks on other ports . My firewall/gateway is also a web server for other stuff so it needs ports 80/443 for itself as well . That is why the forwarding is handled by Apache . Also the distro specifically protects itself against direct editing of set-up . I 'll check to see if I can selectively forward ports based on url using iptables and whether that is available to me . Apache is a common enough forwarder and would it not be in ScreenConnect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's traffic ? <p> Apache can forward HTTP traffic , which works fine ( after the RelayAddressableUri change ) for our web server port 80 stuff , but it ca n't forward raw TCP traffic , which is used by our Relay , and is why you 're having trouble connecting . <p> You can use a different IP than Apache is using on 443 , or you can use a different port . But you wo n't be able to dual-purpose the same port/ip combination for our Relay service . <p> If you want to give us a call during ET business hours , our linux expert would love to give it a shot . <p> Ahhh - raw TCP traffic . I will do some research . I 'd love to take up your offer , but will have to work around the limitation of me being in South Africa and having a small window for this .

I 'm all for placing the lock option in the menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows Start menu&gt; press the arrow for more options and selecting lock . <p> Actually - this would be a great feature . Indeed a popup would be a bit intrusive - this should be added the same as other settings like ' blank monitor ' on the side panel . Lock windows session on disconnect ( on/off ) . Then you could set the global default in screen connect and it could be overridden on a per session basis . Also - this should be something that is communicated to the client software for that session @ the start of the session and also when it is toggled in session . That way , if you lose connection with the client mid-session - it will still take effect . Having the prompt in there would actually reduce security - as if the session drops - you will not get prompted and the software will not have a chance to react . Finally - by making it a toggle in that panel , it should later easily allow the preference to be set per client machine if other feature requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like access sessions to prompt the host for lock on disconnect rather than just auto lock at a minimum . What Prodata suggests would be ideal , but in the short term if we could get a compromise that would be great . <p> The users need to log back in currently when we 're done helping them , and we may have to disable the lock on disconnect due to this . I 'd like to not rely on technicians locking desktops , but I 'd also like to keep end users happy . <p> We would really like to see this - and YES - as a pop-up on the host session when exiting ! It NEEDS to be intrusive .

At first I figured there 's something about the Linux install that was goofing , so I created a Win 7 VM in virtualbox using a bridged adapter to keep it on the same LAN and then after installing SC , I copied all of the files as instructed . There does n't appear to be anything I can find in the web.conf file that should cause this . In fact , when I go to my Administration screen Status page , everything is green . <p> The only difference " in-house " is that the server has moved from 192.168.1.110 to 192.168.1.104 I then re-configured my router to forward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , should be all that 's required . <p> All of the unattended installs point to my No-ip DNS which directs to my external IP correctly . <p> When you moved the installation to the new server , did the old server remain powered on and online ? Sometimes you may need to stop the services on the old server in order to ' break ' the current TCP tunnels to the clients which forces them to renegotiate the firewall and be redirect to the new server . <p> Thanks Scott for replying ... I was able to get it corrected yesterday . <p> Yes , I had stopped all of the running services , etc . I did two things yesterday , one or both of which allowed it to start working . <p> 1 ) I changed the IP address of the new server to reflect the address of the original ( I highly doubt that was the issue since I had redirected my port forwarding to account for it ) and <p> 2 ) I discovered that my router had had UPNP running and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-spite of the port forwarding settings . This is more likely the reason , but since I made both changes at the same time , I can not say with any certainty .

Check out the thread I created last month about it ... <p> Originally Posted by : nrosseno Go to Quoted PostOriginally Posted by : Scott Go to Quoted PostWell , I 'm not familiar with Unidesk specifically or how best to deploy it , but you would need to use the KB article to which you linked if you 're going to be installing the client to a master copy and then imaging that to deploy it .

Install the Screen connect . msi generated from your server . <p> After Installed , use the link in the OP to modify the registry changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add your relevant groups that will be logging in under your Schema for that specific OS image . We use 1 OS image for non-persistent and Persistent desktops so I added all VDI users . Might as well just add the DOMAINEVERYONE group for testing . Finalize the OS layer , merge with your applications layers and it seems to work good . Only thing I have noticed is it creates temporary entries on the creation/modification of a new or existing VDI . Can easily be deleted after deployments.

Is there still no ETA on getting the ScreenConnect client signed by the Apple app store ? ! <p> Indeed , this is a Question I ask myself everytime I have to help someone using a Mac who has not installed the permanent client.There are several things a MacUser has to overcome when he wants run ScreenConnnect or any new application:Find the download : most people including MacUsers do n't  know where these go . Apple also has ( god , why ? ) hidden the download button since safari x.y.Unpack the download : Depending on Safaris and The Systems settings , zip files will be automatically unpacked or not . The " normal " preferred way for a MacOSX application would be that a " . dmg " -Disk image file is downloaded . If this is opened a new Drive will appear on the users Desktop . This even will happen automatically after a download if the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied if the Application is not from a registered developer or from the AppStore . Since 10.12 you can not choose to permanently allow unsigned applications . The user has to go into the system preferences , security , and make a one time exeption for this installation.Next step , when the user starts the installer he has to remember his password . Most Macs will log you in automatically . Many users just forget their passwords because of this . <p> It should be desirable to make this complicated process as simple as possible , because the less time and frustration is needed ( on the phone ) to get on the remote computer , the better will be the actual session together with the client . <p> ScreenConnect can not produce a miracle , but at least try to make it easier then currently/use a Mac Like installation procedure:Create a Mac DMG instead of any other download format.Register as a MacDeveloper and sign the application ( maybe it even wo n't take long until the system wont accept an unsigned app ) This is nothing special . Its just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a technical difference between SC and other remote-support applications ( this is a guess only , maybe SC has other problems I do n't  know about ? ) : an on premises ScreenConnect needs to know where to find its host . Teamviewer or logmein will always connect to the mothership of the company . Also SC needs to know a few more parameters . Therefore the SC application which is downloaded , is dynamically generated before download . This makes the process of signing the application impossible . <p> But if SC would be delivered on a DMG not only the download and unpack procedure will be improved , the application parameters could be delivered in an extra folder on the DMG , so the Application itself is untouched , and signing with an apple developer certificate by screenconnect is possible.Generating a DMG dynamically on the commandline is possible at least on mac and linux . I did not find any windows tool which could be integrated in a windows version , but that does not mean that it does not exist.Even , if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a DMG ) , the SC owner could use this to interactively prepare a DMG under windows , put the signed Mac Application and a folder with the parameters on it . In this case , the sessions name will be not known or will be identical every time the DMG is used . But this could be fixed by asking the client his name ( and other things ) not before downloading the Application from the server , but after is has been started . The SC functionality has not to be completely rewritten for this , only an addition has to be done : if a variable like the username is not known then ask the user . <p> There is speculation and many guesses in this receipe , but I think , this should be doable within a timeframe of several years ? <p> We are aware of the challenges facing OSX users in general and we 're not ignoring them .

My basic request would be to have the guest service provide security when you connect to a session .

If not entered the connection would drop . <p> I would think this would be fairly simple to query the windows security database for a password . <p> So ... we want to launch the host clients from outside the web UI ?

If somehow the Screenconnect server would be compromised one could have full access to every unattended computer attached to that server . <p> Security can be improved more by displaying which user/company has access to the pc and keep track of remote sessions with a local access log . I see this shortcoming very often with all kinds of remote control software at our clients computers , somebody has installed unattended remote control software but the client has no idea who , what , when or why ! I think every user should have to right to know who had access to his computer , when and how long . <p> I know this has been an ongoing request . Is this something can be looked into again . What we are looking for is a pre-authentication before gaining access to certain servers and desktops .

Next time I want to connect the Client Software it would additionally ask for the Yubikey / Google Authenticator / Email / Password that was setup and if all is right then grant access . All this without removing the current protections , that are set at a User/Role level . <p> We have been happily using screenconnect as a logmein rescue replacement for a couple of years . Now we are looking to use it conjunction with Labtech as our main form of remote control ... which requires use of the unattended feature . We have validated the functionality works as we would like it to but the security concern brought up in this forum is huge for us . In addition can unattended work at scale , say 3000 workstations at once or will it kill the sever ? The exact way in which this is solved is less important to me than having the confidence that if Screenconnect server is compromised that someone does n't have access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security treath and can not be underestimated , if the server side of things gets compromised then everything goes to shit . It needs to be addressed ASAP it is a huge liability nightmare . <p> I have discontinued the use of unattended sessions until this issue is solved as the server is internet accessible it would be unwise and extremely dangerous to keep using it . <p> Unfortunately due to our audit posture we are in the same boat . <p> Same here . Please add this feature ! The **27;1895;TOOLONG can ask for a password which will be stored on the local PC.A client-site stored password for extra security is the only way to prevent abuse if the screenconnect relay-server would be compromised by a hacker . <p> Setting the password from the Admin page would be great ( by selection or group ) as then the admin could change the password for a whole bunch av machines at once , without having to redeploy the clients.Or have them towards an LDAP source , that way one could run LDAPS to different servers depending on department or site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buy the way LDAP support must be true LDAP not some Microsoft . Net special build that does n't work with other directories or sources . Go for open standards else ScreenConnect will never become more then a test at our sites . <p> After spending some time looking for what I thought must be built in I stumbled over here and found this thread . I 'm really shocked there 's no client side authentication option that you can set . There needs to be a second layer of defense past the server--I do use a yubikey but that 's only helpful when people are playing by the rules ( which attackers never do anyway ) . There 's no way to be totally immune to exploits , and the thought of 1 compromise immediately turning into hundreds or more is frightening to say the least . <p> It looks like this thread has been around for some time with no time line set for this ' feature ' , which is really unfortunate . I really like the software but this issue will force me to look elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( <p> I am a small entity that likes the screenconnect features and the price . <p> I was working through things and thought of needing a second password request before initiating an unattended session . <p> I thought about this because I want to give 1-3 other Tech 's access to the back end as hosts/whatever , but I do n't want my unattended clients being " available " for them . That means , Tech 1 , 2 and 3 can access the admin side , and each can see their own respective Unattended sessions , or worst all , but cant connect to them , because they do n't have the unattended session password . <p> Additionally ... <p> I think the admin/login to the back end needs two-factor authentication , ideally using the smartphone app/stuff like the Microsoft Authenticator or the Google one or the whatever . That would make the server side awesome . <p> Please can you consider this , advise about this , so I can feel more secure with my imminent purchase . <p> We are looking to transition from LogMeIn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features preventing us from doing so . We need a second layer of security in case someone accesses the admin/host panel via an exploit . <p> Currently we use LogMeIn Central and the " Free " clients.Their product either : -forces you to set a computer password if you have a blank password and you are the only user-forces you to authenticate with a user/password combination before you can even see the screen . <p> In summary depending on the OS and user account config , I sometimes have to enter user and pass , and other times only a password . <p> It seems to me that the un-attended access client for LogMeIn must have an authentication proxy component because it will also allow you to change your password if it has expired . <p> I 'd like to see something along the lines of , allow access with local/AD credentials if nobody is logged into the PC . And if someone is logged into , show a prompt locally to allow or disallow access to the PC . Of course this should be configurable . In a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example but still prompt for credentials . Like some people say here .. without ANY kind of prompt , if someone gets access to the console , it becomes a free for all . <p> Has there been any progress on this ? We 're still anxiously awaiting the ability to restrict reconnections to unattended Windows PC/server sessions to remote Windows accounts that have " Log on Locally " rights to the remote PC . <p> Some progress yes . There are some discussions on how to best protect all access to the machine , not just viewing the system . We are leaning toward 2-factor auth to start and also looking at password management integrations . I do n't have a timeline right now but it is toward top of the list and being looked at internally . <p> Can I ask what the specific objection to integrating it with the remote computer 's " Log on locally " right is , if there is one ? Implementing two-factor authentication and other authentication mechanisms are nice options , but I think that simply implementing the " Log on locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for something like this , because this is exactly what your competitors in the remote login space ( LogMeIn , GoToMyPC , etc ) all offer right now . It satisfies the requirement that each customer 's endpoints be protected individually , and it leaves control of the credentials used to login to any given endpoint squarely in the hands of that endpoint 's owner/administrator . <p> No real objection , just looking at this holistically and basing our decisions on all the different requests we have in this forum post , others , email , etc . <p> We have requests from managing all the passwords , to the ones you mentioned above , to requiring a password manager system , etc , etc . For the past few months we have been running questions by some of the big compliance organizations to make sure future changes will stay inline with their expectations going forward . <p> You do n't need to have a password .. you could do this instead .

@@96443477 @643477/ <p> I have several clients of mine who prefer to keep Screen Connect Access on their computer so it is easier to connect whenever necessary . Especially for the blind or the elderly or even the people who have a hard time understanding how to download and install the Support file even with all the fancy pictures and directions . It just seems it is less time consuming to just leave the Access connected to the clients computers , only if they would like to , and only for my regular clients or clients who pay by monthly . However , privacy becomes an issue . I would like to be able to tell my clients that they have control over when I can remote in or not by the host being able to turn on or off Screen Connect .

LogMeIn has both features ( enable/disable as well as optional user prompt , with an added option of allowing the remote user to take control if the user does n't respond to the prompt ) . I think this is a critical feature for many because , let 's be honest , it really is a pain in many cases to walk someone through the temporary connection . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really have to jump through a bunch of hurdles to get it running , and that 's not so easy to do with technically challenged individuals . <p> Now any Session in the " Unattended " group will not prompt for control . All the other sessions where the " Prompt for Consent ? " is listed as anything other than " No " the customer will receive a prompt to connect . It also allows you to change it easily per customer by editing the " Prompt for Consent ? " field for the session to be " No " which wo n't prompt or " Yes " , blank or anything else , which will prompt . <p> We did recently throw together an exe that can start and stop the unattended client service .

This would be an extremely useful ( and in some cases , necessary ) feature to have , and it 's a bit disappointing that not only has it not yet been implemented , but it does not appear to be mentioned in the upcoming versions either . I really like ScreenConnect , it gets a lot of things right , but it would be SO much more useful if we had the option to require user consent before accessing a machine through the unattended client . <p> Big +1 on this . I have the exact same concern . I really want a simple ' enable/disable ' feature on the unattended client . Also coming from LogMeIn this is the BIGGEST feature I miss . When I offer the option to install the unattended client I feel obligated to tell them I can access it at any time . ( As the server admin the consent option is something I can turn on/off at my will . That 's not truly giving the customers control . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them they can turn it on/off at will , and I would show them how to do it .

Why not just add this option as a right click submenu to the screen connect notification icon ? What about updating client version ? Can we still push an update when client disables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feature be useful or not , I think it would so I agree with everyone here . But the last post discusses one of a few potential problems with on/off client functionality . If customers disable the tunnel which gives you access to their client they are also removing access to send updates or any other maintenance related activities . <p> A ) Will this create problems ? No clue . But worse case is that after a few version updates there is a backward compatibility issue which means tech can not connect to that version of client even if it is enabled . Or we can connect but certain functionality is not available . <p> B ) Updating clients is an option but depending upon age of client that may not be 100% . <p> C ) Could connection methods be separated from updating , maybe . But honestly if you can update a client its probably not a huge leap to think there is probably a way to push a new version that does n't have this option enabled . <p> Again , I like the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be useful to share some of the potential issues with this model that were raised in our internal discussions . <p> Sure in essence the post with the . exe that starts/stops the unattended is what most people have asked for with the goal it would be built into the client file . If the concern is privacy then on/off button is really the simplest way to accomplish that concept . Now customer has a little icon on their desktop that starts the service and requests help . I 'm sure there could be some customizations but overall it meets many of the basic requests . <p> There are certainly some advantage with us doing this out-of-the-box because it is then officially supported and we can expand upon the capability . There are also some advantages with the unattended wrapped in something ( like this . exe ) that has community support and development . I believe there is currently work being done on the tool to handle some of the service settings , allow for icon to be changed , and maybe ways to auto-enable/disable based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would open it and play with the settings then I could no longer connect to them . I like the fact that ScreenConnect does n't have anything for them to mess with . <p> Ok , so that post mentioned was specifically looking for something that did n't require . net . Is that your concern as well ? Taking . net out of the mix it sounds like your objective is a client file that resides on desktop ( somewhere on guest machine ) . They click that file to initiate the connection from their side to your installation of ScreenConnect , is that correct ? If so then the . exe file that starts and stops the unattended would work correct ? Or perhaps there are other features you are looking for ? <p> Just trying to figure out what aspects of solutions available today are not meeting the expectations . Thanks in advance for any feedback . <p> Sorry Jeff , the . net is n't a concern for me . My concern is I do n't want the unattended installer to have settings for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exe file that starts and stops the unattended would work . Others do not , that 's why I suggested the stand alone . exe . Something similar to the Teamviewer Quick Support . <p> I still think the best solution is just to provide a separate " Restricted Client " which works just like the current " Unattended Client " but is designed with the privacy of the customer in mind . The differences would be : <p> The first part should be easy since this is just removing a feature . The user consent part can be as simple as a dialog box asking " A &lt;company&gt; technician is attempting to connect to your computer . Do you want to allow this ? &lt;Yes&gt; &lt;No&gt; " These differences would mean the user 's privacy is protected and there is no need to stop or start the service . So updates can still be pushed out as required and we can still see that a user 's client is connected via the GUI . <p> The point here is that in some situations , such as when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer 's needs have to come first . I want to be able to provide assurance that I CAN NOT access their computers or see what is on their screens without their express permission . Even if I wanted to . <p> Requiring user consent would be the right way to go . However , what about people with only one license that have to switch between clients with a single license ? Does that mean I will have to get the clients consent every time I switch back over ? I switch between several computers at one time constantly . What a headache that would be if I had to get a clients consent every hour or every minute . <p> Instead , give the client the option to turn on/off the ability for a technician to remote in BUT allow for sending update commands so the client software stays up-to-date so there are no connection problems down the road . <p> I do n't see why this would be hard . If client turns SC off on their end , then when a technician tries to connect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it will still show the green connection bar on the host UI showing that the software is still connected and installed on the clients computer , just disabled . Or maybe it can show the green connection part with a red diagonal slash across it indicating client disabled remote support . HOWEVER , still give us the ability to update their software . <p> Also , when the client disables the client software on their end disable screen shot previews . <p> Please do n't make us request consent every time we want to connect to a client . It is such an out dated feature . Instead , give the client the on/off switch . That will give them the best piece of mind of all . <p> Hmm , that is a good point CTEZ . It would n't affect me personally , but I can see how it would be an issue for others . <p> The thing I like about having a dialog box pop up is that it does not require any knowledge on the part of the user . However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and intuitive enough , then that would be fine , as long as the service itself remained up . The option for the tech to " re-disable " remote access remotely when they are finished would also be handy , users can be forgetful : ) <p> I like your idea of having a red slash through the green connection bar on the GUI for disabled connections . It would be nice to know that a client 's SC installation is still working , even when the connection is turned off . <p> All good points , couple of thoughts as I was reading . And please take these as me playing devils advocate a bit . Each time I think through all these permutations of how this would work , these are the questions I have . <p> 1 . Access is not just limited to joining a session , there is also command line access . And probably in the near future 1/2 dozen other features that would allow various levels of communication with the guest machine that we have requests to implement . So these would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly some level of trust needs to be established with customer , if our . exe can update itself but not allow you to connect ? I know that may be a tough sale for some customer environments . Because if you can update the client you can most certainly change behavior , remove functionality , etc . Customer would have to ultimately trust you because they will see that . exe is communicating to your installation of ScreenConnect but understand that this 2 ways tunnel is not something you are taking advantage of to do other things . <p> 3 . If you have that relationship or if the concern is just seeing the screen , then the existing ' HostWithouConsent ' option would ask the customer before you can connect to their machine . <p> Overall I think on/off can be done , there is already a tool in the forum that is basically doing this now . And on/off with some sort of limited tunnel is also probably possible but it still raises some security questions . We could publish something talking about how its meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ScreenConnect is self-hosted , modifications can be made to the clients which we have no control over . <p> Anyway these are the points that hit me as I consider the ways I would implement this . <p> I ca n't speak for everyone , but here are my answers to these questions : <p> 1 ) If a feature allows a tech to view or access the client 's computer in any way without their consent , then it must be disabled . <p> 2 ) Any updates pushed out to customers should not enable functionality which does not comply with 1 ) . As long as the customer is still able to control access to their computer , trust should not be an issue , except for our trust in ScreenConnect to keep the privacy controls intact in the client . This is closed source software , we ca n't modify the client ourselves . <p> 3 ) There was no real question here , but the focus seems to be on trust and existing solutions . The scripts to start and stop the service , while better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they start and stop the service . HostWithoutConsent is not a solution at all since it can only be controlled by an administrator . <p> As for trust , I think the benchmark for a real solution should be that the answer to the following question is " yes " ; <p> One comment Bartman , the client actually can be changed in the field , we have customers today who have added their own features to our unattended clients .

To provide the service your customers expect " and your business relies on " you 'll need the power to connect to computers quickly and securely , to keep local and global client relationships strong in today 's always-on environment . <p> Which begs the question , how do you choose the right solution ? With so many options and so many similar sounding features , the choice can feel overwhelming at best . Here are eight must-haves to make the choice a little simpler , and guarantee your remote support is ready to support your business now and into the future . <h> 1 . Data Protection <p> You need to make sure- that the solution you chose has a solid security feature set and the ability to scale to meet your specific needs . Remote support is another inroad into your business data , so make sure you 're choosing a tool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option that includes : <p> Brute force protection <p> Two-factor authentication <p> SSL <p> Role-based security <p> Password management <p> Alerts <p> Audit reports <p> You are protecting- your information and that of your customers . And remember that all the security measures can not 100% protect against human error . Make sure your team is using strong passwords and keeping those safe . <h> 2 . A Price that Makes Sense <p> You know better than anyone that your business success takes investments , of time and money . But that does n't mean that you have to pay top-dollar to find a solution that fits . Your remote support should meet your needs and your budget , and have the ability to grow with you too . <p> Opt for a tool that 's affordable , scalable , and fully-functional . Popular licensing methods include user based , concurrent , and agent based . Each has some strengths and weaknesses , so take the time to decide which one works best for your company . <h> 3 . Plays Well with Others <p> Running a business requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a clear understanding of all of the software , tools , operating systems , and hardware that you and your customers depend on . Your remote support solution should easily integrate with them to keep your company running efficiently . <p> Choose a tool that works well with everything else you depend on . <h> 4 . Comprehensive Control <p> You rely on your remote support to connect you to your customers ' machines " whether for monitoring or fixes . If that connection is all you need , and you 're not worried about speed or compatibility , then take your pick . If you 're hoping for a little more , find a solution that makes remote control simple and let 's you avoid complicated software installs or over-the-phone walkthroughs for your clients . <p> Look for something that supports not just Windows , but Mac , Linux , Android , iOS , Chrome OS , and Windows mobile . End users are changing , and so are these products , so your solution needs to be prepared for full compatibility to stay scalable. <h> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or solution and been unable to find the answers you need ? That 's a frustration that you and your customers should be able to avoid . Implement a solution that has consistent support available to you and your team , with answers at the ready and the resources you need to keep providing excellent customer service . <h> 6 . Teamwork <p> A strong team relies on collaboration to get the job done quickly and accurately . If your remote support solution does n't also offer remote meeting capabilities , you 're missing out on an easy way to promote team collaboration , and to share information quickly with your customers through screen-sharing and simple document sharing . <p> The right solution allows your techs to help each other or request help easily , and gives them the capability to chat with end users , share screens with customers , and set up meetings to help explain issues quickly and directly . <h> 7 . Compliance <p> Compliance is n't something you can take lightly . In fact , your customers are counting on you to get it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , not harder , to stay compliant . <p> Look for a solution with recording capabilities as a regular part of the interface , to make sure you have the ability to maintain compliance even for customers in highly regulated industries like healthcare . <h> 8 . Lightning-Fast Connectivity <p> Last , but certainly not least , you need to make sure that the speed of your remote support connection is able to keep up with your fast-paced business needs . It can be problematic when a customer has to wait an extended period of time for you to connect and assist with their issue. - Connections should take seconds at best . <p> Look for a tool that allows you to connect on the fly , get help requests directly from customers , allows for temporary software installs for non-managed machines or break/fix scenarios , and includes options for permanent agents as needed . <p> In the end , a remote support solution is meant to make your job easier , delivering a tool that supports your efficiency , productivity , and customer service . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current one is n't making the grade , start with this list to guarantee you get the support you need to keep your business on the path to success . <h> We Do n't Like Limitations <p> Experience what all-inclusive remote support feels like at no cost to you .

@@96443499 @643499/ <p> You can do this through a combination of Managing Session Groups and Defining User Roles and Permissions . The basic process is to create a Session Group of the machines that you want the particular user(s) to be able to access and then create a Role from the Security tab on the Administration page and grant the users the ability to view and join that session group . There 's a pretty good rundown of the process on our KB , specifically here : LONG ... and LONG ... <p> I know those guides can be a little boring to read , so I 'm including a basic rundown of the process below : <p> Once you have the machines reporting back to the server , you can sort them into session groups using Custom Properties ( such as Organization ) . First find the Manage Session Groups button on the bottom left of the Host page . After you click it , a dialog should appear with the three types of sessions and the default groups that come with ScreenConnect . Now you have to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following value into the filter : <p> CustomProperty1 LIKE ' CompanyA ' <p> This will sort any session of the same type with ' CompanyA ' in the Organization field into that group automatically . <p> Now that you have the session group created and the filter in place , go to the Security tab on the Administration page and either create or modify an existing role to include the permissions LONG ... <p> These three permissions will allow any user assigned to that role to view and join any session that falls into the session group , CompanyA . <p> An example of how you can really use this to provide access to specific machines to a specific technician ( say for their accounts , or something like that ) you can use a Custom Session Property in conjunction with a session group to provide a dynamic session group that will only show those sessions to which a user has access . In my case I used " CustomProperty2 " and made it visible to Access Sessions , and named it " Authorized Hosts : " , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Account Representatives : " or what not . <p> Next I created a new session group called " My Machines " and used this for my filter : <p> Finally , you use the " Edit " command to edit your sessions ( or build the access client with a users 's name in this value ) to include the username of the host that should have access to that session . With this filter , if more than one host should have access , you can use a comma separated list as such : Steve , Ryan , Larry , Michael , Mike , Will <p> If you want to use comma followed by a space ( Steve , Ryan , Larry , Michael , Mike , Will ) then use this filter : <p> A few notes , you 'll want to make sure your ' restricted ' hosts ca n't manage the session groups or " Edit " the session , or else they 'll be able to control who can access the session via the " My Machines " session group . Also , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Session List , just like " Organization " or other enabled custom properties would . <p> So using this and Scott 's suggestion above , you can create a single Session Group and a Single Role to manage the access of multiple hosts easily . <p> UPDATE : <p> Jeff posted a great article on how to do this similarly using Notes for a single user by using the filter ( NOTES LIKE ' ' + $USERNAME + ' ' ) <p> There we go , all the things and as short as it can be ... As a note $USERNAME will use the Display Name of the user ( the name that appears in the corner of the page when they are logged in ) , which may not always match the actual login i 'd . If you want to specify one or the other specifically , use $USERLOGINNAME or $USERDISPLAYNAME as appropriate starting in 6.1 I believe . <p> Also starting in 6.1 , there is a $USERROLES which contains a full list of the user 's roles . The roles are separated with pipe characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string . So if you wanted , you could put users in a role with a company name as the title , and use a custom property to show that company name , and those users would have access to those company machines , but you would n't have to make a session group for each company , though with the ability to clone roles added in 6.2 , that 's not as big a deal anymore . Anyway , it might look something like this : <p> $USERROLES LIKE ' * ' + CustomProperty1 + ' * ' <p> Note that this only allows matching with a single role , and you ca n't use pipes in CustomProperty1 values , but it would work great for doing something like:CP1 = Company NameRole : " AccessMachines " ( permissions as appropriate ) Role : " Company Name " ( no permissions necessary , or can set this up on a per company basis and clone for rapid updates ) Session Group Name : " My Company Machines " Session Group Filter : $USERROLES LIKE ' * ' + CustomProperty1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just make sure it 's CP1 value is correct and that users that should have access have a role created and added that matches the company name.Could be used for departments ( team leads can access team computers ? ) , etc . <p> Edited by userFriday , May 19 , 2017 2:47:56 PM(UTC) Reason : used @ instead of $ on one of the variable names ... oops ; - )

It concerns the " Build Installer " function . At the moment , I 'm asking each user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Custom Property 2 " field . However , when there are hundreds of users , this manual process is cumbersome and mistakes can be made . So , I 'm wondering whether there 's a way to automate this whole process by reprogramming the installer " the . exe file " itself , such that each user merely needs to run the installer . Is this possible ? <p> It seems like you could use GuestLoggedOnUserName instead of CustomProperty2 , though I suppose that would n't work if they need to be able to access the machine while they 're logged out or if they 're running the installer on machines where they have different usernames . <p> Another option is putting an environment variable as Custom Property 2 ; unfortunately , you ca n't just use %USERNAME% directly , since it 's resolved in the client service , which runs as a system user . But if you can set a system environment variable to the correct username ahead of time , you can just use that variable . For example , you could have a batch/powershell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs the installer . Group Policy might be able to do it , too , though I 'm not very familiar with its functionality . <p> I was looking for a way to grant users under my account access to specific computers when they log into my ScreenConnect server with a ScreenConnect user account that I create for them . Many times I would be granting access to a single computer for a user that wants to access their computer at night from home . Additionally , there would often be overlap with a manager/owner that might want access to multiple or all computers at their office . FYI - I am an MSP with over 70 cliens and 1500 computers in ScreenConnect . After contacting ScreenConnect support they pointed me to this forum post . <p> By following the initial instructions in this post and creating a Session Group that uses the $USERNAME variable I was able to create a dynamic session group that gives users access to only the computers that I assign to them . I called the Session Group " My Computers " . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CustomProperty2 LIKE ' * ' + $USERNAME + ' * ' <p> I then created a Role on the Admin --&gt; Security screen that granted access to this Session group : <p> Here is a user I created called ' Test ' with only this role assigned : <p> Now when the Test user logs in , they ONLY see the Session Group called " My Computers " . When a different user logs into ScreenConnect they will see a completely different list of computers in the " My Computers " Session Group .

ViewSessionGroup : ' My Computers ' , etc . ) . But when I log into with that user , no PC shows up . Any ideas as to why it works with one and not the others ? Anyone using LDAP method ? Thanks in advance . <p> You will likely need to compare what you 've set in the custom property value to what you have listed for the user account in AD - offhand , I believe it 's going to pull the " User Logon Name " field under the Account tab .

Try creating this batch file and run it manually to see if it 'll work for you as well . <p> Thanks Jon , your response helped me to think straight and focus on the root causes of my issues . I 'm going to document them here in a longish post because I did n't find much help online for my use case and it might be helpful to others . <p> This only applies to users who are sharing a Windows server with IIS-hosted web sites or self-hosted services and ScreenConnect . In addition , I am using an SSL certificate to secure the ScreenConnect Web Server service . <p> My problems started when my ISP summarily relocated my VPS ( and assigned new IP addresses ) with a day 's notice , screwed up a couple of settings and subsequently ' reset ' my custom configuration using ' CPanel ' or equivalent support tool . I had also neglected to record all the required setting and could n't figure out what had gone wrong . Here is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ScreenConnect site from scratch while co-existing with IIS ) : <p> 1 . By default , IIS manages all available IP addresses and allows ' wildcard ' bindings for sites , meaning that any address can be allocated at runtime . You can see the managed IP 's like this from the command line : <p> 3 . Something that was confusing but obvious in retrospect was that the address I had mentally reserved for ScreenConnect was showing up in netstat as being listened-to by process I 'd 4 ( System ) even though no sites were actually bound to that IP after I cleaned up the wildcard bindings ( by assigning explicit IP 's in IIS Manager ) . This ( below ) is normal if an IP is on the IP listen list ( even if unbound ) as shown in item 2 above : <p> 6 . The SSL certificate in my case expired during the migration snafu but even if it had n't it would have had to be bound to the new IP manually since you do n't have a handy ' website ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and add the new one using the thumbprint of the certificate . ScreenConnect recommends using a string of zeroes for the Application I 'd field in the command line argument below : <p> 7 . The ScreenConnect Web Server will NOT operate with an expired SSL certificate because it can not secure the session to it 's satisfaction . You set this up by specifying https in the web.config file as in step 5 above so do not assume that you can simply ignore the warning . <p> 8 . In addition to being unable to get the Web Server and Relay services started ( with the event log errors above ) I had additional issues with IIS IP/port bindings . One way to troubleshoot this is to stop IIS from the IIS Manager , successfully start the ScreenConnect services and then restart IIS . Sites with clashing bindings will not start properly and this will be graphically indicated in IIS Manager . You can then go in and change those bindings to a free IP address . In my case , that ' CPanel ' type ' Portal ' site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Server so I simply pointed it to my primary IP ( I have three , a primary and a secondary by default and an additional one for ScreenConnect ) . If you have a plain vanilla windows server with standard websites on port 80 and a free port at 443 , two IP 's should be enough . Note that using a port other than 443 may backfire because it may not be accessible from behind corporate firewalls . <p> 9 . In my case , firewall exceptions for ScreenConnect migrated successfully but you may want to recheck them before using the ScreenConnect Administration page to verify your installation . <p> On my current server setup I performed more or less the same actions as you , ( minus the SSL certs ) , and could n't get the ScreenConnect relay to consistently start after a server reboot . Sometimes it would start , more often it would n't . So I gave up and created the batch file I mentioned earlier and setup a scheduled task to run the batch file 5 minutes after every server reboot . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes or so after every reboot . Not how I would have preferred it , but good enough for now . <p> Well I 'm a jack of all trades myself so I ca n't add much light to that situation : - ) although I 'm tempted to guess that it 's because the IP is not ' available ' or resolvable at boot for some reason related to the DHCP/gateway etc. - I had something like that happen once with my own product in a situation where all the customer machines were being automatically rebooted at midnight on Sunday . <p> One possible alternative to the macro would be to try setting the service startup type to Delayed Start ( Automatic ) ... <p> I 'm not familiar with the netsh command you guys are using , but in your IIS config is there a wildcard binding on port 80 ? If so , you can remove that and specify the IP/port/hostname ( optional ) combo you want enabled for the websites you run in IIS . Alternatively , you can simply disable the default website and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the short is you do need a dedicated IP for SC if sharing port 80 with IIS , but you should be able to tell IIS to not use that IP address at all . <p> I 'm not an expert on this but I believe that listening on all IPs port 80 is the default behavior as of IIS7 , even if there are no sites bound explicitly or via wildcard ( * ) , and that there is no GUI alternative to netsh within IIS Manager - if anyone knows of one , please share . <p> Odd that I 've never encountered it before , of course I 'm using IIS to redirect port 80 to 443 on my SC installation so it does n't apply to me . <p> If it 's an issue of " who gets the binding first " - perhaps you could configure your SC services to Automatic Start and configure the W3SVC ( IIS ) service to Delayed Start . That would at least give SC a chance to bind to its IP addresses if the netsh command does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back because I saw an update and this time I noticed a problem with Jon 's macro . That 4th line is a sort of infinite loop problem - the ' delete iplisten ' allows Relay to start in line 3 but the ' add iplisten ' after that sets IIS up to ' recapture ' that IP for the next reboot . Which is why you need to run the macro again . <p> I 'm not sure but I would expect to find a warning in the event log when you do the ' add iplisten ' after starting Relay since , this time , it 's IIS that ca n't take ownership of the IP . The point , I guess , being that even if something were causing you to independently need lines 1-3 , line 4 is almost certainly redundant . <p> If you did n't already have it working and also did n't have better things to do , I would suggest running the ' delete iplisten ' once manually from the command line and trying for a delayed start on Relay . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the migration , but sometimes simple is better . <p> Do you have a specific need for IIS ? If you do , then I 'm sure that there is some sort of work around , but if you do n't , why not uninstall the component ? <p> It does sound a bit drastic , but sometimes the KISS approach has its advantages . On my ScreenConnect install , ( Server 2008 ) I chose not to install IIS and I have ScreenConnect configured to listen on port 80 and use port 443 as the relay address : it makes going through firewalls simple . <p> The one risk I am taking however is passing my login credentials in clear text . That risk could be mitigated by enabling Two-Factor Authentication . Another option would be to buy an SSL cert and flip the ports . As with most things in IT , there are usually multiple options when it comes to solving a problem . <p> Kinda surprised this thread is still alive since there is a fairly comprehensive resolution at post #5 ... <p> Thing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can simultaneously and securely support ASP.net web sites , WCF services AND remote access/meetings then ScreenConnect works great , you just have to rent an extra IP address and configure stuff appropriately and - unlike this genius - remember or record the configuration settings , which are about as simple as they can be given the requirements . <p> Also , if you install a $10 SSL certificate from namecheap.com and dedicate port 443 for https then customers will be able to securely connect to a meeting or support session from behind corporate firewalls with about 1 command line statement and 3 edits to the web.config file ( see post #5 ) .

It does scan SC with AVAST sandbox but allows it to continue . <p> So it would be awesome if Kaspersky would play nice with SC and vise versa . <p> No real update beyond we are having communications with correct teams .

This may or may not be possible in all scenarios but that is our goal . <p> I implement the Trusted Application fix on regular and contract customers , but the problem remains with new customers and the occasional one off support call . It is often quite difficult to walk the client through enabling the Kaspersky interface so that these settings can be made . I 'd still like to see a real solution from Elsinore , or at least some sign that they are still working with Kaspersky to get whitelisted as a remote support soution. 
@@96443523 @643523/ <p> Hi , I just moved ScreenConnect from an AWS to Office based Linux Mint server . I can see all of the PC 's in my list but none of them are online so that I can connect .

Installing the remote client software surely is giving them the correct hostname to connect to . <p> I looked at the user.config file and it 's pointing to the AWS server . I think your right the issue has to do with the way I had originally setup Screen Connect . I think I should have used a domain name instead of an IP address .

You use the old server to update the remote clients with the new hostname . <p> The process is you change the web.config file on the old server , then send a Reinstall instruction to the remote clients .

Perhaps receiving this type of screen before the Windows Logon screen could be an option for those who do not want to store credentials on the ScreenConnect server . <p> Thanks ! <p> This screen is presented by the LMI remote viewer prior to gaining access to the client . LMI was acting as a buffer between the host and the client , and then injecting the username/password into the remote machine , similar to how the " Store Credentials " feature is already working for SC . is there a reason you 're not utilizing the " Store Credentials " tool for the clients you 're attempting to log into , Technigogo ? <p> I 've been fighting with this recently with a lot of very long , very random passwords . I 'll admit that I have n't tried using the stored credentials since I 'm averse to storing anything that may change in a location I 'm not familiar with and I 'm not sure how that system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't know how the stored credentials are supplied to a system to drive the login process but assuming it 's handled through programmatically sending keystrokes to the host . I 'm wondering if it might be feasible to add a text input box to the ScreenConnect interface where one could paste copied data and then press a button to have that text sent as keystrokes to wherever the cursor is on the host . <p> Until something like that exists I quickly hacked a Powershell script to take the clipboard contents and send it as keystrokes to the currently open ScreenConnect window . I created a shortcut to it and set a shortcut key to invoke it when I need it . I fought with making it more generic to send to the " current " window but since I 'm only ever using one remote connection at a time this works fine for me . Someone who has spent more than 15 minutes with PowerShell could certainly put together something much more elegant but since it works for my simple needs I figure it might help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are moving to all 24 character random generated passwords and they are a pain to type out 3 or 4 times before you get it right . Even if you get it right the first time having to do this a couple dozen times per day is exhausting . As noted above there is already a long list of remote access programs that do this . Understandably this would take some time to do since the clipboard service is not available at the login screen , but I believe the other programs make it work by emulating keystrokes . I would n't mind if it does n't pull directly in from the clipboard , even pasting in to a " Login password " dialog or the like would be better than nothing . <p> After typing my initial response , I found a workaround where you can store the login password in ScreenConnect for Access . You have to type the password in at least once possibly twice at the most . <p> Login into the computer as you normally would <p> Click on the Gear &gt; Prompt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , on the remote machine <p> Next time you login click the Gear and choose Send to Screen <p> The password is stored for future use . <p> Another nice feature of this is that an Agent can login without knowing what the password is . <p> It would be nice to do what @AustinKnight suggested and be able to add this in the Console . <p> So I did some testing with this today . This is a step in the wrong direction in my opinion . The following is not an attack on ebell for finding a workaround that will likely be good enough for some until SC makes a proper solution , but reasons why a proper solution is necessary . <p> 1 . The prompt for credentials happens on the guest side not the host side , so you have to be logged in to the guest to save the credentials in the first place . ( yes ebell was likely referring to this with mention of needing to type the password once or twice , but with my following points it should be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Once stored they are there for all hosts until someone logs in , prompts for credentials , saves an empty credential to overwrite the original . <p> 3 . Prompt for credentials is not intended for this use , it is for the user on the guest side to log in so the host does n't have to know their password to log in as the guest user should the host need to reboot the guest machine etc . <p> 4 . Password saving of admin credentials is a huge security risk , even long term storage of more limited user credentials should not be allowed as it allows someone to impersonate that user in the future and it may not be the same host user that the guest user intended to share their credentials with in the first place . The stored credentials should only last for the host session it was given to and then it should be securely destroyed . <p> " Another nice feature of this is that an Agent can login without knowing what the password is . " In my world if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and you should n't have access to the things that password allows you . <p> 5 . I know I could limit access to machines with SC group permissions , and I do this to some extent already . I already have a separate password management platform for managing access level to passwords with auditing capabilities that tracks who has access to what passwords and when , the prompt for credentials circumvents this and could get us in trouble for a SOX or HIPAA audit . Legally having access to a password is the same as having accessed anything the password allows regardless if other auditing can show that the password was not used by that user . <p> Ideally there should be an ability on the host side to enter creds and have them not be saved but sent to the screen only one time . This should be possible since the ability is already there for sending the password to a login screen that does n't have clipboard pasting as demonstrated with the stored credentials . <p> Any news on this ? IMHO this can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a high priority now that this is expected to be the primary tool for MSPs , as customers of Labtech , to remote into our client 's systems . <p> +1 - It 's surprising that the original post is six months old without any real response . I 'm just now moving to LabTech and ConnectWise coming from LogMeIn and we 're already using some very long passwords which is going to make this a very painful tool to use . I do n't like the idea of storing passwords indefinitely on a client 's machine either . LMI Rescue has this capability , but once the session is gone , so are the credentials .

@@96443534 @643534/ <p> I believe there needs to be a way to switch from Support to Access seamlessly . For example , I am supporting a guest and find out I need to do some reboots in normal and safe mode so I need to pull out Access . However in order to do that , I need to build the installer file , save it to my local computer and then drag/drop to clients computer and then launch it . THEN , I have to remove the support connection . Waaaaay too many steps . <p> Two ways we can solve this : <p> 1 . There needs to be an option under " MORE " on an active Support guest to " Convert to Access . " Then ScreenConnect will auto create the access file , download it onto the clients computer and install access AND uninstall/close the Support connection . <p> OR <p> 2 . When creating a build installer for Access provide the option to " send to ... " and then allow to select an active Support connection . Then ScreenConnect will auto copy the build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then tech manually removes the support connection . <p> I 'd prefer option 1 because it is more automatic but maybe not doable . <p> I have created a php file at the root of my website that redirects to the installers and assigns the correct department name . After this file is in place , I just run the command : " msiexec /i http : **28;2558;TOOLONG ? c=acme " and the current version of the unattended client is automatically installed . <p> You can find the value for k by inspecting the URL that you are directed to when you manually download an installer .

You just need to use the reboot function from the tools menu or is there something I am not understanding correctly ? <p> Not sure what you are getting at but you can create your client and install it from your toolbox . <p> I had been doing that , but I had 2 installers for each of my 20+ departments , Mac and PC . And the first time I updated my server , I realized I had to re-generate all 40+ installers ( and pay attention that I did n't misspell any department names ) . My redirect script grabs the installer from the server on the fly , so it never has to be manually updated . I also use it to install the unattended client when I 'm physically present at the workstation .

However , it still leaves the technician to have to close out the Support session on both ends after installing Access . I almost wanted Support to have the ability to turn into Access when needed . Example , Support had all the features as Access , only they were switched off until activated . So when one needed to use Access instead of support , one would go into their host panel and select something like " Convert Support to Access " and then everything was automated from there . That would be perfect . <p> For the time being I 'll just do what I am doing but hope the developers are watching and putting this on their to-do list .

Beyond that , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsiveness to help people integrate your product into their own software and you have a clear winner . Keep it up guys ! <p> I looked at N-Able at one point and it was n't super clear as to the best way to integrate . I thinks its command line option was somewhat similar to Kace but integrations would never be super clean . Several RMM and ITSM solutions allow the setup of a URL for passing the necessary commands . This is a pretty clean way of handling integrations . N-Able is on the radar , we have a team member cleaning up an integration for a help desk product now and then hopefully looking at N-Able and 2-3 other tools right after that . <p> B ) This information is also available in the registry of the machine .

Being familiar with the architecture of N-Able , I can tell you it 's going to be impossible for anyone other than N-Able themselves to provide completely seamless integration . Because the ScreenConnect client GUID needs to be known , the only way for this to be automatically populated into N-Central would be a rule that uses a script to push it into WMI , and then a custom service to retrieve it from there . But none of the user-configurable RC options will be able to access that value . <p> But , I have created the next best thing ! It 's a chrome extension , and you can access it from the Chrome Web store : <p> Once this is installed , wherever an N-Central remote control icon is on an N-Central page , this extension will inject a ScreenConnect icon next to it . Clicking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load a list of hosts from your ScreenConnect server which you can directly connect to . <p> By default it will assume that you have ScreenConnect session groups that exactly match your N-Central customer name , and this will filter the ScreenConnect list such that there will only be one device in it . <p> If you disable this option , the list will search on machine name only , so if you have duplicate machine names in your customer base then you 'll have to pick the right one from the list in the popup . <p> thanks for sharing this with us , you 've got some talent , thanks for sure and put some work into this .

I may have missed a step or two so be sure to check if it is working properly . Also note that if you have database cleaning enabled ( Admin -&gt; Database -&gt; Delete Access Session Activity ) it will delete the notes after the given time period . <p> EDIT : Just noticed you are using Active Directory . Not sure if this will work . Maybe someone from ScreenConnect can chime in . <p> Thank you for the suggestion ckibodeaux . I will tinker with your idea today and see if I can make anything happen . I 'll let you know the results . In the mean time if anyone else has suggestions or input please share . <p> This does n't work if you have 50+ groups , and want only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech can access all groups and computers except the IT Director 's PC , because the " All Machines " access group is still there . <p> The only way to do that is to specify which Access groups technicians have access to . That means adding each group to each technician , with 50 groups and 5 techs , that means manually adding 250 groups . Not to mention adding groups to each technician as new ones are created . <p> Create a Session Group named something like " My Computers " and for the filter use " Notes = $USERNAME " ( without the quotes ) . <p> In Admin -&gt; Security , make sure to assign proper permissions to the user to access that session group . <p> This should put only computers matching the current logged in user in the session group .

Basically , you 're going to create a group that filters based upon the user 's username . I 'll include a brief rundown below : <p> First , the easiest way to do this is to enable an additional custom property , basic steps on how to do this are here : LONG ... this example , we 're going to be using CustomProperty2 . Basically , for any session that you want a specific user to be able to see , try putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom property field . <p> Next , you need to create a new session group ; for this example , we 'll call it UserAssigned . Set the filter syntax to something like : <p> CustomProperty2 LIKE ' * ' + $USERNAME + ' * ' <p> This group will now automatically display any session where the CustomProperty2 field contains their Display Name but only to the person to whom it belongs . <p> Now , go to the Security tab on the Administration page and create a new Role . For this new Role , give it the three basic permissions : <p> You may also want to include other permissions , such as TransferFilesInSession or ReinstallSession , but it 's up to you . Now , any user who belongs to this group will only see the computers on the Host page where the second custom property string contains their username.

@@96443576 @643576/ <p> We have been using screen connect for about 2 years now and it has made our jobs so much easier . We have run into issues now though with the fact the Chrome no longer supports click once and it has become too much of a hassle for our users to try and download and run a file . We also have trouble directing the users to the small red text that will need to select to that says " Try next option " . We upgraded recently to 5.0.7791.5406 because I read that this would address this issue with the Windows selector function but all it does is have them select a file to download everytime or worse , it continues to default to the clickonce for Chrome . We use Google apps for Government so we have the default browser as Chrome as it offers the best functionality for our end users . <p> I would like to know if there is a way so that we can force all the users to go to the web selector first so it will make it easier for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what page they will come to and it would just make it easier . Even better would be so that it goes straight to the boxes where they can choose to download and install the web app or just run it automatically . <p> I was wondering how other people using screenconnect were dealing with the loss of Clickonce and could offer any insight . <p> Interesting . I upgraded to 5.0.7770.5402 and removed the Clickonce extension from Chrome . Then I connected to our ScreenConnect system and it asked me to download file first which I did , and since then I just double-click on a server and it connects in a second . Works nicely for me ! Thus I wonder why it is n't working for you . <p> 1 . Yes with the recent changes to Chrome we have worked to replace ClickOnce . For technicians we have provided the Selector tool that can live on the machine ( does have a footprint ) but makes joining sessions fast , similar to ClickOnce . By default for customers our model is for them to download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then hit the Run prompt to connect to your session . <p> 2 . Customers could get the Selector tool by clicking the Try Another Option , couple of times , until they see the Download App prompt . This would allow them to install the tool . However this does have a footprint and leaves something on their machine . <p> 3 . There are a few other options that are releasing in 5.0 for example the customer initiated session . This still downloads the client but can be coupled with an extension so that guests do n't necessarily need to go to their browser to join the session in the future . <p> I hope this helps a bit but I would like to use this as opportunity to gain more feedback . <p> From a remote support perspective we have always worked hard to keep as minimal or no footprint on the customer machine . However we are sometimes asked for other options where there would be a footprint . Our thoughts are if you are working with a customer over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just a one time thing , then you probably do n't want to force them to have a footprint . <p> But we could be completely wrong , maybe a footprint is not as big of a deal for many of our users ? I would love to get more feedback so please let us know . Please keep in mind there are a few new options like customer initiated in version 5.0 and the Guest Session Starter extension can be pretty helpful . <p> I definitely understand not having a footprint . If we are able to have the same function of connecting right away without a footprint would be ideal but for the sake of convenience , it would be so much better if we could install something on their computers and then they would not have to worry about them trying to download and run a file each time we need to assist them . It adds on time to our calls trying to direct to finding the spot where the file is downloaded and telling them to run on the box . So much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist in order connect in and finish running the executable file . <p> We also did not mind having to install clickonce on all our computers because this made connecting to users so much easier . We pushed the extension to everyones chrome installation via GPO and so having a small program run in the background that would allow us connect would not matter to our computers either . We could use the unattended install but some of my techs like to use the coded sessions to allow people to connect at their convenience . <p> A ) Can be confusing for customers to find the donwnloaded file in browser to execute.B ) As you have GPO capability it is not a big deal to push something that can facilitate connections faster.C ) Footprint not ideal but ok.D ) Unattended I 'm a little confused on . Sounds like your end users might not mind a persistent connection but the general use model is to allow them to initiate the session . Which is interesting because if end user had this installed it eliminates all of the other concerns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean as your techs connected the customer would be prompted to approve the connection , which would give them control over when tech can join session . <p> And please note I 'm not against other options as were previously outlined . I am just trying to figure out what is lacking with current models that prevented their use . Was it a feature , security , training , documentation , etc . <p> Our Techs like being able to setup a session with a code or having users go to the Guest page and clicking on their name . The only issue with using the unattended client is that we do n't connect to the users using the Guest page anymore . The unattended client is working great for us in the remote offices where we are able to connect to the computers and work on them without having a user connect . We always have the Consent before connect on any session because alot of our users were upset that we were connecting with them allowing even though they have to select " Ok , Join session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the ' Hostwithoutconset ' but only our remote computers that are for our remote offices when only a few people rarely use them . <p> From a remote support perspective we have always worked hard to keep as minimal or no footprint on the customer machine . However we are sometimes asked for other options where there would be a footprint . Our thoughts are if you are working with a customer over and over again then perhaps the unattended is a good option . If its just a one time thing , then you probably do n't want to force them to have a footprint . <p> But we could be completely wrong , maybe a footprint is not as big of a deal for many of our users ? <p> We have , primarily , two types of users , both being external to our organization ( customers ) . The first is ' one-offs ' , where you would assist them typically no more than once or twice , maybe three times over a two-day period . And that 's it . <p> The second use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship ( approx. 2 years ) where periodic access might be required . In this circumstance , being able to initiate a session as fast as possible is really useful . <p> In neither scenario is the unattended option appropriate ; we do not want the ability to arbitrarily access their machines , and it 's important that we 're able to tell them , unequivocally , that the only way we can get in there is if they explicity initiate the session from their side . I suspect lots of people would be in this scenario . <p> However , we already have our client software running on those machines , so one more bit of footprint that exists only to facilitate faster/easier session joining would be acceptable in 98%+ of cases , I would think . For this reason , I think I 'll be going out of my way to install the app during the first support session , and I 'd give a big +1 for efforts in this department . <p> Thank you very much for the feedback paulwye . I am going to paraphrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So unattended is out because customers need to know you have no way to access their machine without their consent . Even though the HostWithoutConsent option is present you have control of that and you could n't unequivocally tell customers you could n't access their machine if unattended is installed . So back to adhoc support sessions this is preferred method because you can NOT gain control of the machine without consent . So this brings up a few items I would like to discuss quickly ( anyone please chime in ) : <p> A ) Traditional ad-hoc support would mean that customer ( depending on browser/OS ) would navigate to your site or click on email link , download a file , execute the file , and the connect . For example in Chrome the . exe should download to bottom of the browser customer clicks on this and your connected . <p> B ) WindowsSelector app once installed will facilitate connections similar to Option A above however the customer will not see the file download or need to execute it going forward . This decreases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footprint ( the app ) always installed going forward . Is this ok with your customers ? They do n't mind the footprint ? They trust that this app does n't give you control but instead facilitates ad-hoc connections ? <p> C ) New customer initiated support in conjunction with extension allows customers to have an icon on their desktop that they can click that to get connected . This works similar to Option A above but does allow customers to initiate the session and they do n't have to navigate to your URL . <p> As I look closely at all the options going forward ( these mentioned and others ) , what I really need feedback on is why Option A does n't work for some customers ? It should be pretty easy and if its not we can work on that . Option B I certainly see the appeal but I worry about having a footprint on customer machines . Will they like that ? Will they trust that it does n't give the tech unrestricted access ? And option C I really like the direction its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantages above the first two .

We used to use Echo VNC and customers used to click on the exe on their desktop , type their name in and hit ' connect ' . We 've had comments that this would be much easier than going onto their web browser etc - some ca n't type a web address all too well ... <p> A question I had is have you thought of a file ( that could be created by the host ) that would talk to a particular SC server and just ask for invitation code ? <p> So unattended is out because customers need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . <p> Bingo , yes . Many of our clients ' machines contain sensitive information and it just kind of has to be this way , unfortunately . <p> Originally Posted by : Jeff <p> A ) Traditional ad-hoc support would mean that customer ( depending on browser/OS ) would navigate to your site or click on email link , download a file , execute the file , and the connect .

It 'll also be neecessary for the second type of customer , at least on the first go-round ; the issue there is that they typically need support infrequently , and just enough time elapses between support sessions that they forget the steps to initiate a session . <p> Originally Posted by : Jeff <p> B ) WindowsSelector app once installed will facilitate connections similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file download or need to execute it going forward .

They trust that this app does n't give you control but instead facilitates ad-hoc connections ? <p> Yes , you 've got it exactly . For context , the application we support is a videoconferencing client ; in a similar way to the remote-support sessions , it 's okay for said client to be installed ( and thereby have a footprint ) , but it 's not okay for the client to be set to auto-answer incoming video calls . <p> Originally Posted by : Jeff <p> C ) New customer initiated support in conjunction with extension allows customers to have an icon on their desktop that they can click that to get connected . This works similar to Option A above but does allow customers to initiate the session and they do n't have to navigate to your URL . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this for some of my customers . Like the poster above mentioned , in the Bad Old Days ( before SC ) , we used to use a custom built reverse-VNC executable that would just sit on their desktop and allow them to connect to specific machines with listening VNC viewers ... it worked reasonably well but SC was wayyyyy better at the time , and I first subscribed back in the 2. x days ... things are even better now . <p> Originally Posted by : Jeff <p> As I look closely at all the options going forward ( these mentioned and others ) , what I really need feedback on is why Option A does n't work for some customers ?

By the time we get to the point of initiating a remote session , they 've probably been trying to access their material on their own , then they 've contacted support , we 've run through the basics , so it 's likely that several minutes have elapsed , they 're missing a real-time session , and they 're getting a little frustrated . Removing steps , making things obvious , and decreasing the number of things that can go wrong ( hello having to install Java on a Mac UGGHH ) all help to keep everyone happy . So yes , option B is n't right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people ; as for a question of trust , it could ultimately be about demonstrating to someone on the other side the exact functionality of the tool and how it is , by design , impossible for a session to be established by any means other than the customer initiating it . Same deal for Option C ; I would likely present this as an option for anyone who does n't mind a footprint ; I have n't had the advantage of a desktop icon for years now ( I tried an IE-URL shortcut for a while but stopped bothering ) but if that option existed I would definitely use and love it , and so would they . <p> Poyol , thank you for the feedback . While this method is not exactly what you are speaking of its close . Take a look at this new guide one of our team put together . Specifically points 3-5 LONG ... We are always thinking of new ideas and ways to facilitate connections , one of our main goals has always been to try and have no residual footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluttering up customers desktop , add/remove programs , etc . Once a file is on their machine our concern was that user would think you could possibly get access without their permission . But more and more comments seem to focus on fact that many just do n't mind having something on customer desktop or something installed on their machines if it makes things easier . And that is sort of the main topic here . We can do all sorts of things if there is something on the machine installed . We can even do a lot of cool things with a . exe that lives on the machine desktop that makes API calls . <p> I will certainly review your feedback with our team . And please let me know what you think about the Guest Session Starter mentioned in that guide . <p> Paul , this was very helpful thank you . I hope others chime in on this so we can get more insight to how others want to use these options . I agree that all of them have their place and now we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing for everyone ! <p> Why not simply create universal . exe so when customer starts it he just type few numbers and tell us what the numbers are and once we see these in our side we can join it.This way we can leave the same . exe on any PC , web site ... ? <p> We could do something like that possibly . Of course the . exe would need your public/private key , your URL , and it would need to know your port . So we would need to get that information at least ( might be forgetting something ) in addition to the general . exe on the customer machine . <p> There would also be the customized settings ( app.config ) and icons that optionally would need to be added . <p> A ) Can be confusing for customers to find the donwnloaded file in browser to execute.B ) As you have GPO capability it is not a big deal to push something that can facilitate connections faster.C ) Footprint not ideal but ok . <p> YES , YES , YES ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , who tend to be less than savvy with technology , have such a hard time with the downloads and on-the-fly installs . Many customers refer to their browsers as " starting Google " , the idea even of entering a URL is fairly mind-blowing concept . Teamviewer have pretty much idiot-proofed this , " Click on the square blue icon and tell me the codes " . Some customers are still flummoxed by the UAC challenge but they at least have a 50% chance of clicking the correct button . I would love to have something as simple in ScreenConnect . <p> We could do something like that possibly . Of course the . exe would need your public/private key , your URL , and it would need to know your port . So we would need to get that information at least ( might be forgetting something ) in addition to the general . exe on the customer machine . <p> There would also be the customized settings ( app.config ) and icons that optionally would need to be added . <p> That would actually be excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exe where we would fill in the needed server adress along with some auth code so that the next times a customer needs help , he/she just clicks the exe and connection is established . Then it would only be a slight hassle the first time the customer initiates contact . <p> And then maybe further down the road , you come up with a better 1 click exe : ) <p> I 'd just like to add my voice here and complain a bit . I 've been a huge fan of ScreenConnect since a little over a year ago , when I first settled on it for remote access and support needs . That being said , the recent changes are simply not intuitive for the end-user in the slightest . <p> In theory , I would n't mind the process involving the client downloading and running a file to connect to the session . In practice , it 's a real pain trying to figure out where that file is saved for them to run it because every browser handles the process differently . My recent experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaults to trying to run the java file , which fails 90% of the time . I then spend the next 5 minutes walking them through the process of finding and clicking on the small red text until it actually downloads an EXE , for them to run . <p> IE : after going through the failed java attempt , downloading the exe has lately resulted in warnings about the file not being safe and it wo n't download . If they are running Windows 8 , the option to actually run it is buried under several warnings and hidden in " other " sections . <p> Firefox : Same thing as chrome , but most people ca n't seem to figure out where the downloaded files are located once the window goes away . Even worse is when they swear they are using Chrome , and so you spend 5 minutes giving them incorrect instructions . <p> I know ClickOnce going away changed some things , but I personally never used or depended on the pluggin in the first place . I was still able to just have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloading and running the exe file without issue . Every once in a while I would have to go through the process of figuring out where it was saved , but it was maybe a once a month ordeal . In the last month , I have n't had a single remote session go smoothly . <p> When it comes to leaving a footprint , I think you guys have been on the right track in terms of avoiding that ( outside of unattended installs of course ) , and it 's always been nice to confidently explain to my clients that the program cleanly removes itself after we are done . <p> Also , please stop trying to make Java the default launch method when it does n't seem to work half of the time ( or more ) . Java is a notoriously buggy program in the first place , with a shady update method that often leaves multiple conflicting versions on a workstations ( not to mention toolbars every time ) . Maybe have Java show up as an option on the list , but call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to actually launch . <p> Anyway , sorry for the long post , but after the last attempt at a remote session I have seriously considered alternative vendors . At the very least , do something to get Microsoft to stop flagging the program as " Potentially Unsafe . " <p> Thanks again for all the great responses . I have documented this for our review and asmkm22 I sent you an email as your experience sounds incorrect with how I would expect certain browsers to work . I think it would be good if we could arrange a support session with you to see what might be occurring if you have time .

I then reinstalled and the client again and it showed back up . <p> My opinion is that the " End " button functionality / location ( put it somewhere else in the GUI with special permissions ) should be changed ASAP .

Deleting the client in the database was the only way to be able to connect again . This was done in a development environment with virtual machines . I would n't recommend it for production . <p> I agree with the other posters that this feature could be better handled in another menu or putting a different description . " End " is associated with meetings and sessions as a way of closing the ( for lack of better word ) channel . By putting " end " in remote access , logic would mean that this would disconnect any joined hosts . <p> For example , I 'm hosting a session from my tablet and then get to my desk and see that I did n't close the session from the tablet and it 's tying up a license . I would click " end " thinking that it would just close out , not permanently removing the access . <p> To recover from the ' End ' deletion of client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevant computer ( Windows 7 Pro ) ( in this case I was on site , but any alternative connection means I expect will be sufficient , other than SC ! ) <p> 2 . Attempted to simply re-create the unattended option by adding and downloading the . msi file from our SC server <p> 3 . Download completed and installed but SC does not activate , it seems that there is some form of residual setting that is not overwritten by a re-install . This also implies that " End " does in fact create / damage some setting that is an artifact with no reset process . <p> 4 . Uninstall SC from the Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Programs <p> 5 .

I do not have the newest version of SC installed but I assume there is a warning once you click " End " ( which hopefully will be changed to ' Delete ' ) <p> So the mac uninstall issue I have noted both as an improvement but also to support . Please if you are still having problems with this contact our support team so they can assist you . I will suggest that we look at the permissions and where this button is located .

Also just uninstalling the agent and re-installing the agent did n't seem to work , but deleting the sqlite row for the client ( as you mentioned ) did work for us as well.End Session should be called Delete Session or remove client , we have removed this right from all of our accounts until this behavior can be called something less vague . <p> yes all resource strings can be changed to be whatever text you would like .

Kind of like root and sudo on *nix .

This very issue comes up over and over in various forms in numerous threads and has yet to be fully addressed . <p> This is .. insane . No warning what the button does.Ending a session does n't feel like it means what this button does.I 've tried the uninstall/fresh install trick , and now it looks like I have to go diving into the database .. this is infuriating . <p> First you install sqlite3 so you can browse the database.Then you change directories to where screenconnect 's database is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenconnect and edit the DB at the same time , but it is unwise imho.Make a backup copy of the Session.db in case things get fubar'd.Run the sqlite browser on the DBRun the bit of sql that will delete the offending session/name.quit exits the sqlite browserThen we restart the service . <p> If you have multiple offenders , you may need to use <p> Code : <p> . schema Session <p> OR <p> Code : <p> select name FROM Session WHERE name LIKE %partialidentifier% <p> to try and narrow down some of the fields . Replace %partialidentifier% with what you can remember of the host name.The following would find my name , for instance . possibly others too . <p> Code : <p> select name FROM Session WHERE name LIKE %jhugg% <p> Please be apprised that ' and " and all have slightly different meanings in SQL.Please be apprised that non-alphabetical characters may be encoded , try not to use them when searching/listing . <p> So one of the tech 's I work with was just a victim of this . Good thing the location that it was removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have now changed the button label to read " Remove " and also removed access from using this feature for them . <p> Quick and easy question though , if someone has connected to an unattended session and has left it connected by accident , how do I remotely disconnect that session ? <p> I completely understand the SC is customizable , and I have done just that . I have also restricted this function ( now labeled " DD " for Dirty Delete LOL ) to only an admin account that no-one else has access to but myself as it is my backup account . <p> But this does appear to be a manhole with no cover waiting for future SC adopters to fall into without warning . <p> Ah thanks Scott . I just fiddled around with it , the issue before was that I did n't another person could connect to a session that 's already in progress . I think a button to end the session , much like what many users in this thread originally thought the " End " button did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see very much use for the current functionality of the " End " button . <p> I just accidentally used END because I did n't see another way to do it ( probably browser related ) when using my tablet to check something real quick . I have uninstalled and re installed numerous times yet still can not get it to show back up . Even tried restarting the service . I am not comfortable mucking around in the SQL database , please tell me there is another way to do this . <p> Maybe " End " should be called " Delete " in the unattended sessions ? And maybe it should also be under " More " , as this is not an action someone would do regularly . <p> On the access session , the wording is fine , as it ends the session while stopping the client . <p> Also , changing the Web Resources is not enough . As this changes the text on all session types , and the problem is only with unattended sessions.Maybe also a warning before being able to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you want to remove this client without uninstalling the the client software ? " . <p> Going forward we are going to not have it for admin or host accounts by default . This is not an overly common feature for remote access so the default role-based security will just have the end for support and meeting but not access . If needed for some cleanup reason then you can enable it or have a profile that has it enabled for cleanup . <p> Just found out after upgrading to 5.1.8473.5522 that when I click on the red X to close my session to the remote client . When I click Yes , I am agreeing to End the session and I have to go through the process above which is rather frustrating . Any other ideas ? <p> npsupport - You are getting this message when you end a remote support session or remote access session ?

That is EXACTLY one of the reason the End button was created . It was designed to remove the session from your list . You are correct if the client service is still running on the other machine and calls back in the End button is stopping the service and removing it . But if the machine never comes back on the End will clear out the session from list . Now let 's say the machine has called back in and you want to uninstall you can : <p> A ) go to More command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from add/remove program or similar for Linux/Mac <p> This seems to be a bad feature End should mean turn off the session or disconnect the session not kill it forever . We paid for Licenses and several of my tech and I have deleted a bunch of remote support clients not realizing that End meant to die a horrible death . <p> Please remove this from the base menu and allow the techs to end unattended sessions left open without having to log in to the session . Additionally a warning might be in order .... <p> +1 for moving this features to some hidden place.and +1 for renaming it to some name which makes more sense . <p> It is a nice feature of SC to be customizable , still the SC staff should care about choosing default names which make sense:I install a clientI connect to a sessionI disconnect from a session or I end a sessionI uninstall or remove or delete a client <p> Honestly the problem is n't the wording , the problem is a button has 2 completely different functions based on where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit it every time you are done or you tie up all the Licenses , the other location you do n't want to hit it or you delete the computer and are unable to access it . This is not the same function and should not be the same button , the ability to name them differently in each section should be standard . <p> It really was meant to have the same function . End for support is to remove the session from your list of sessions . And for unattended it was the same goal which is why by default we used End . Moving forward we have removed this from the unattended role based permissions . Of course this would n't change for existing customers who have already adjusted this setting . <p> I will submit having two different button names . <p> But also I am not sure why you would be constantly using the End button in support sessions . When you click the ' X ' when closing out a session there should be a prompt to End the session permanently or leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt ? Or is there something else in your use model that is restricting you to use the End button on the Host page for support sessions ? I am hijacking this post a bit here so please feel free to email in your response to sales@screenconnect.com or reply here . If conversation expands we can pull to another post . <p> The biggest cause of mistakes on our end is in a case where Tech1 started an unattended session but for some reason did not close it . Tech2 needs to use the system but gets an out of license message so looks and see 's Tech1 has an open session but is not using it anymore so he " ends " the session to free the license . <p> The issue is a combination of a licensing model where " sessions " are a tech connected to a remote PC , and a session " end " button that deletes both ends of the session and not just the tech . There is no easy way to boot a tech and free the license except to log into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out yourself , then log into the session you wanted to begin with . <p> It really was meant to have the same function . End for support is to remove the session from your list of sessions . And for unattended it was the same goal which is why by default we used End . <p> Create a custom group of active unattended sessions , now pick one of those seasons and end it . Now read the above sentence and tell me that is the only action the end button performs in this scenario , I argue it removes it from the whole server not just the list of sessions . <p> Honestly we could argue this to the end of time , but what ca n't be argued is this thread is overwhelming proof that regardless of what was intended the button does not perform as end users expect it nor want it to . <p> I just had this same issue . Someone inadvertently clicked the end button on two windows 7 machines which were unattended and then I was not able to get the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To recover from the ' End ' deletion of client unattended operation I have : <p> 1 . Connected to the relevant computer ( Windows 7 Pro ) ( in this case I was on site , but any alternative connection means I expect will be sufficient , other than SC ! ) <p> 2 . Attempted to simply re-create the unattended option by adding and downloading the . msi file from our SC server <p> 3 . Download completed and installed but SC does not activate , it seems that there is some form of residual setting that is not overwritten by a re-install . This also implies that " End " does in fact create / damage some setting that is an artifact with no reset process . <p> 4 . Uninstall SC from the Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Programs <p> 5 . Download fresh . msi from our SC server <p> 6 . Test and all good . <p> On both machines a simple remote from program and re-add was not good enough . I had to remove from add/remove programs , then REBOOT the machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is crazy that a year later the 5.2 latest client is doing this . If end is ' remove ' then should n't clicking end actually remove the software from the client ? I presume its a permissions thing that the app does not have the rights to remove itself maybe ? But there has to be a better way to handle this . <p> For now , I have renamed the button and removed the permission from the unattended computers as suggested in this thread but this is a workaround . SC should try and fix this please ! <p> I just had this same issue . Someone inadvertently clicked the end button on two windows 7 machines which were unattended and then I was not able to get the session back in . <p> If this happens to you or anyone else again try following the instructions for " Method 2 " at this link . I believe it might be a quick way to get the machine to re-establish its link with the SC server . I use this method when imaging machines and it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnect an access machine that has been " ended " without having to do the un-install and re-install method . <p> If this is a quick workaround keep in mind I believe it will only work once per PC . If the access PC is " ended " a second time I think you will have to un-install and re-install SC .

@@96443587 @643587/ <p> I 've asked this in the past , and had several people say they would also like an option to display some sort of notification ( other than the desktop turning black ) that a technician has connected to a computer . Unfortunately the request(s) have gone ignored or it was mentioned that people do not what this functionality . While I understand some may not want or need it , I find it hard to believe that anyone would not want THE OPTION to do something , especially when it comes to security . That 's like people saying they definitely do not what the ability to use SSL , and that feature not being made available in screenconnect because some or most people do n't want it . Anyway ... <p> What I , and many of the employees at my job ( e.g. the CEO , CFO , COO , Financial Controller , HR Manager , etc. ) would like is at least the option to provide some sort of on screen notification that a tech has connected via screenconnect . Something along the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the host sees at their monitor ( I think logmein does this ) . <p> Another feature , which is even more ideal , would be a second connection icon for a " request connection " which will pop up a window asking the person for permission for the tech to view and/or control their screen . It would be nice if this was built into the security groups too , on a user and computer basis , but just the request option available at all would be a great start ! Another feature that would make this better is the ability for the " request " window on the host to stay open throughout the session , with a button allowing them to end the session . This is useful at times when the person needs to quickly open a file or email while the tech is connected ( and should n't see ) , and when a tech walks away from their desk leaving a session running ( or just minimizes it and forgets about it ) as the host can not work on confidential material until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now have meeting capabilities , enhanced auditing , etc. , but this lack of host security is really making my life difficult . Every time I need to connect to a VIP 's computer , I get an earful about how much they disapprove of this is tool . I do n't work at a large company either ( a few hundred employees ) and I can only imagine that this lack of host security is a deal breaker for many larger organizations . <p> Thanks both for the post and providing relevant information about a few of our new features . I wanted to comment on one or two things : <p> 1 . We do n't ignore any of the posts in here or requests . While we may not get to all of them as quick as the community might like we look at the overall requests across all forum posts , emails , phone calls , etc and try to prioritize for future versions . Sometimes things that we see as really good to add we will hold for a bit because we know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it makes sense to apply the change then . <p> 2 . Also while we did add the request control option in 3.1 we have several other independent feature requests around this that we think have a lot of merit and will add eventually . For example in 3.1 we added the ability to disable/do n't disable the wallpaper to help customers who do n't want users to know they are logged in to the machine . And we did the same with the balloon in the task tray . We are also looking at doing the same with the icon . So we may add other similar notifications or alerts to let people know you are on the machine . Of course one of our customers I spoke with not too long ago has a toolbox item that he sends to the client machine that runs during the session which was basically a picture saying hey I 'm working on the machine . <p> Is there any way to assign it to just the client or client group and not the tech . We want all of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some clients want us to ask for permission before we connect . <p> Is there any way to assign it to just the client or client group and not the tech . We want all of our techs to have access any time the need it , but some clients want us to ask for permission before we connect . <p> I figure until such a feature is included I can use 2 accounts , one for users ( request permission ) and the other for kiosks/servers/etc where I just barge in uninvited . It would be nice to set this up on a per node basis instead of per user . <p> TBH , the only reason I see per user being relevant is if some admin wants ' god mode ' where they basically spy on anyone , while everyone else has to get the users permission . Granted , there are better tools out there for monitoring users without them being aware , but I just do n't see much use for only certain people having to ask permission to connect to another persons computer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any of my previous jobs , and is only barely tolerated at my current job . <p> Hey back to the bighifi , the original request was for particular roles so that is how it was implemented .

If I change it back to https : //+:443/ then I connect but it can not work out the encryption <p> I think the problem is that configurator could NOT install the pfx it generated and I installed the main and intermediate certificates by using mmc and importing the two bits separately . It is just that screenconnect is not able to use the certificate that I have <p> I tried opening the pfx directly but it asked for the private key password which I do n't know 
@@96443594 @643594/ <p> We are fairly knew in using SC and we keep on discovering great features , so maybe this is already possible and we just do n't know it . <p> If you select a session it is possible to run a limited amount of ( DOS ) commands even without opening the session first.But using programs or commands from the toolbox requires a real connection to the client first . <p> We have some system cleaning tools in the toolbox that we would like to run on Access Sessions without really opening the selected session first .

@@96443595 @643595/ <p> I installed the unattended client on a 2008R2 server last night and all tested good . This morning I noticed that the thumbnail image was showing a screenshot of a user remote desktop session instead of a shot of the console login screen that I am accustomed to . I initiated a connection to that server with SC and it brought me directly to the same user session as the thumbnail was showing instead of the console . After seeing this , I selected to switch to the Console session and then disconnected . The thumbnail then changed to showing a shot of the console screen and connecting again now seems to default to the console session as expected . <p> There were about 15 users on the server at the time and I did connect successfully direct to the console when I first installed the unattended client last night .

@@96443608 @643608/ <p> Here 's an idea I was kicking around . I was wondering what the possibility is to give a client remote access to their PC(s) via our company ScreenConnect installation . Would it be possible to run with both Windows Authentication for our company support and something like Forms Authentication for the clients we would give access to ? It would be nice to create users outside of our domain that could access ScreenConnect , especially if they needed temporary access . Could , with permissions , you block access to the Toolbox feature ? Or block access to all features and just give someone remote access with no other enhancements ? I see in the Security setup we can now create a security group and give them access to only one specific Session Group , this would be great to grant clients access to their system(s) and we can control the account credentials and remote access capabilities . Currently we use ScreenConnect for remote support and if the client wants access to their system remotely it 's either done via RDP or something like LogMeIn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ScreenConnect and a completely stripped/strippable host .

@@96443618 @643618/ <p> I will check to see if this has been submitted if not I will get it registered . For my benefit during the enhancement submission can you provide me with a use-model example of how you would use this ? I just want to make sure and have as much ammunition possible before presenting to development . <p> On a terminal server/or a computer using RDP , you can only access the system via screenconnect like you where sitting at the terminal . The major disadvantage is when you try to support these users , you are unable to connect to their session . Teamviewer has a pop-up box when you connect to the system , in the lower right corner , that allows you to join a session in progress . With the revitalization of remote desktop being used in companies , this old technology is making a comeback big time , you can use any computer anywhere to " be in the office " at extremely low cost . <p> How does the terminal server support work ? On server operating systems , TeamViewer operates without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously to the server operating system using Remote Desktop ( RDP ) from Microsoft , you should activate Enhanced multi-user support in the Options under Advanced . This generates an individual TeamViewer I 'd for every user who connects to the server using RDP as well as for the physical console . Therefore , parallel and individual work of each session is possible . The Info Dialog now displays two different IDs : <p> Server ID:TeamViewer I 'd of the console of the server operating system ( as if one were physically sitting in front of the server ) User ID:TeamViewer I 'd of the user logged into this server using RDP . <p> Thank you the resurgence of RDP or something like that was what I was looking for . I assumed there was some shift in use model or something you were specifically seeing . Great example and feedback , thanks . <p> This would be a very valuable feature for us . We are now supporting many users who work exclusively within RDP sessions , regardless if they are accessing their virtual PC from in the office or somewhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of establishing an attended session to support them , since the unattended session is bound to the console , preventing us from being able to interact with the users via the remote support session . The suggestion about allowing the user to select any active session on the machine ( console or RDP ) makes perfect sense . That feature would greatly improve our ScreenConnect experience on a daily basis . Hopefully this feature request can be put on the fast track to implementation ! Thanks ! <p> I too will +1 this , if I could , I would +10 it . I have a customer who has a very big terminal server deployment with over 400 thin clients connected to it . Currently I have to remote to the server , then open the MMC snapin for the thin clients and remote to the session that way . This could cut down support time considerably . I 'd be glad to test it if needed . <p> Just my thoughts here , but ScreenConnect has three pieces - a remote client , a client viewer and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works great . The client side pieces however can be a struggle . <p> However the things people are asking for like locking the work station when a session ends , better speed , better resolution on a Mac , etc are all client side issues . However most workstations already have a client build it . An RDP is included in every version of Windows , except for the " Home " and " Starter " editions , but there is a reasonably priced 3rd party RDP server that can be had for about $15 . Mac 's have VNC built in ; they do n't cal it that , but it is there . Linux machines have an assortment of VNC servers . <p> When it comes to clients RDP and VNC are already pretty well cooked . The source code for VNC is in the public domain . RDP might be a bigger challenge , but again their are third party apps as well as Microsoft product . I use the Microsoft RDP client on my Mac , and while I do n't really like the interface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to Windows hosts . <p> My suggestion is why re-invent the wheel ? Leverage VCN/RDP and then focus on all the advantages and features of the Server part of ScreenConnect . I realize that it is a bit of a " switch gears " approach , but in the long run , I would say it opens up a world of new possibilities . <p> Robert <p> BTW - Sorry for speaking to this twice , but I think it needs to stay in the spotlight . <p> Not since my last update , the 4.4 and 5.0 projects did not have this feature included ( at least in initial planning ) . There are always a few things put into projects that were not planned based on priority , potential impact on the product , etc . While development did seem very receptive to the request it has n't been assigned to a project yet . I have 5-6 enhancement requests to talk with them about , I 'll make sure and mention this one again . <p> I too would benefit from this . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they connect from WYSE terminals at the end users respective station which means a client can not be installed on their machine like you would if the user was just using remote desktop to log in . <p> We have more and more virtual desktops for staff with laptops who work remotely a large percentage of the time and supporting them in this environment is n't so easy . We have terminal servers as well , but this is n't an issue as we have the ability to connect to those desktop sessions . With Windows 7 VD 's , Screen Connect is of no help . <p> It is you are certainly correct . I do n't have any real update for you right now as development has their heads down on 2 projects . But as we move close to 5.0 launch I will certainly revisit . There are about 6-10 features I would like to get into one of our next few projects and this is one of them . The promising thing from development was they did n't look at me like I was crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic about it being a good feature that would n't require a total re-write of anything . <p> Our first step on this path will be to try and provide ability to select the user session you want to join . Adding RDP or VNC or any other tool as a side mount may be an option but I expect it would probably come as an extension as opposed to through core development . Our goal will be to make sure our protocol and software can perform whatever functionality one of those other tools might be providing . The request for choosing the user session is pretty high priority now but not currently assigned to project .

However , this information will not be updated on the server after the initial check-in by the client , and can not be obtained thereafter if it was n't set in a variable at the time of installation . <p> To install the extension , use the Online Extension Browser to find and install the " Set Session Properties From System Variables " extension and install it . Note : At the time this is written , it has been submitted for publication , but is not yet published . <p> Once installed , you should see this on your Admin/Extensions Tab : <p> By default , the extension has no settings defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable name to use for the extension to work . There are three ways to access the Extension Settings . The first is through the Options &gt; Edit Settings menu on the extension on the Extensions Tab : <p> If logged in as an Administrator , it can also be accessed from the Host page by Selecting the " Update Properties from Variables " option when right-clicking a session , or from the More menu when no settings are defined . If the settings are defined , this instead will run the extension . This is useful so attempting to run it without settings in place , it will prompt you to provide them . You can also right click the " Update Properties from Variables " link in the context menu or under " More ... " to bring up the Edit Extension Settings menu at any time . <p> If a non-administrator attempts to run this while it is not setup , they will get prompted to contact their ScreenConnect Administrator for assistance : <p> Once the settings menu is open , you can provide a variable name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **27;4524;TOOLONG " Keys and that will be the environment variable used to populate the session . <p> It will use the same variable names for Windows , Mac , Linux and Android devices , so please pick them carefully . Also , do not use any formatting on the variable names to identify them as variables in most cases , so no need to encapsulate the name with percent signs for windows or prefix them with dollar signs for Mac/Linux/Powershell . For example , if you wanted to get the ' computername ' variable , you would simply enter " computername " in the desired field . <p> To help facilitate differences between operating systems , and to allow setting variables on the fly when this extension is run , you can also specify the Command Interpreter , a " Pre " command , which is run before the variable values are pulled , and a " Post " command , which will be run thereafter in case any clean up is necessary . The Extension Settings editor for this extension has been modified to allow Text Area type fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Once the " Update Properties from Variables " command is selected for one or more sessions , it will send a command to those remote machines . This will happen in the logged on user 's context , so be sure they have the " RunCommandOutsideSession " permission to be able to run this . If they do not have this permission , the option will be grayed out . <p> Also note , the default permissions for the " Host " role does not include the option to Run Commands Outside Session for access sessions ( requires " OwnedAndUnowned " to work with Access Sessions ) . <p> The command and response , for the " computername " would send and recieve commands that look like this : <p> In another example , I set the **33;4553;TOOLONG : **39;4588;TOOLONG : **33;4629;TOOLONG : **33;4664;TOOLONG : **32;4699;TOOLONG : **37;4733;TOOLONG : falseWindowsPreCommand : <p> Resulting in a Session with the following info ( Organization = CustomProperty1 , Words = CustomProperty2 ) : <p> A few notes with this , I set the " ps " for the interpreter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **35;4772;TOOLONG " to false , otherwise each variable would have been prefixed with a " env : " which pulls environment variables , as opposed to temporary variables for the session . I did so because I wanted to use other variables on the session that were not environment variables . <p> I also set the code in the WindowsPreCommand to set the variables as needed , loading the comptuername environment variable into the computername local PS variable , set scvar1 to a set string , and scvar2 to the output of a command . Note that the command , if run directly , provides multi-line output , but in this case , since it is going into a variable , only provides a single line - necessary for this extension to work . If the number of lines of output does not meet the number of variables it expects to write , the session properties will not be updated , but the name will have an error message appended to it to let you know the command did n't complete successfully . <p> Note that for the third CustomProperty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a value set , this will clear out the CustomProperty on the server , which before this was run set to " Testing " . If you do not specify a variable name in the settings for the SessionName or any of the Custom Properties , it will note update or clear them out , leaving them as they exist before the command is run . <p> * Note that all three of those can return different values.basically here we have the variablename without any $ before hand , set with just an = sign , and then the command wrapped in parentheses and prefixed with a dollar sign ( $ ) to get the results of the command , instead of the command itself . <p> On linux you could use : <p> Code : <p> computername=$ ( hostname ) <p> Same general concept . Note that for both Mac and Linux listed , this will set it locally for the script running only , and will not set it globally , so they will not persist . To do this with Windows , if using " cmd " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For powershell , set **35;4809;TOOLONG to false , and use a $ prefix for the variable name on the left of the equation . For example use " $env : " to access environment variables that are available to the command line , like %computername% , %path% , %appdata% , etc.Powershell Example <p> Code : <p> **31;4846;TOOLONG <p> Note that if you leave " **35;4879;TOOLONG " as the default " true " , the code will use " echo $env : 0 " and if set to false , will use " echo $0 " to obtain the variable values when " ps " is defined as the **25;4916;TOOLONG , where 0 is replaced with the variable name by the extension setting value . <p> It says write host in the guest response and has the correct data but it does not show up under the custom property for all my machines . It works for 900 machines , I ca n't figure out why it would n't fill in the custom property if the response is coming back correct . <p> I 've identified the issue and am looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with a change to the product that I need to work around . I 'll update the forum soon with an update . <p> Also , while I 'm on here , here is a good one to have as a pre-run script for to get the relay of the remote machine in a custom property for Windows using powershell ( set varname for desired prop to SCRelay ) <p> The extension is working fine for me on build 6.0.11622.6115 using the sample code in the first post . The name of the display driver appears as expected . <p> However , I 'm trying to retrieve a " last logged on display name " value , but my code is n't returning any results through ScreenConnect . Here is the code that works natively in PowerShell and simply returns a display name : <p> Thanks for using my extension . First , make sure you 're using the latest version of the extension ( 1.1.1 ) . If that does n't help , let me know the browser you 're using when it 's not working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension , and I 'll be happy to take a look into it . <p> this command run alone will return all the available properties of that path . When I do this through ScreenConnect , I do n't see the Lastloggedondisplayname , or even the Lastloggedonusername that I see when I run the command locally on my machine . The reason is most likely that we 're running that powershell prompt as the Local System account on the machine , which might pull different information . <p> You 'll also get a different value than you might expect from getting the username from the remote machine , that should always return the computer name followed by a $ , as that is the username of the local system account . <p> If you 're looking to get the username/etc of the actual logged on user , you 'll have to work about it from a different angle , such as using WMI : <p> the variable is scvar8 without any symbols . Actually when i put a symbol in there it did update the computer name interestingly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ps command . <p> I came up with a working solution for my desired goal of showing the user display name as a custom property . It is a two-part solution . <p> First I added the following code to my user login script . It creates a ' dat ' with the current logged in user display name and the file gets overwritten with each login . I chose C : ProgramData to write the file to as it seems to be one of the few " non protected " default folders in Windows 10 . Works in Windows 7 and 8 too . <p> Matt , thanks for your resposne . The latest version ( 1.1.1 ) does work with 6.0 ( I 've not tested with 6.1 yet ) . It may be that you 're testing with powershell commands on a Windows 10 Anniversary Update ( 10.0.14xxx+ ) ? That version of Windows currently does n't work with our method of running powershell commands ( we get an empty response back ) . You can see this if you try to do something like : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commands tab , you 'll notice you get a resposne , but it 's empty . If this is the case , you should be able to use it with " cmd " for the interpreter , but I 'll admit that can be more limiting . Hopefully we can get a fix in ( or Microsoft does ) for that issue soon . <p> You might be able to get what you need with powershell -command " command goes here " , however ? <p> If this is n't the case , please let me know an example of what you 're sending and receiving as seen in the cmd tab . <p> Hi Steven , I 'm using your extension ( 1.1.1 ) on self-hosted Screenconnect 6.0.11299.6071 and facing the same issues as Matt mentioned.I got some time to dig in , please find my report below <p> 1 . Variable got successfully transferred but Session ( CustomProperty ) never got updated if Guest running Windows 7 . Using PS interpreter and simple $var= " test " I got CustomProperty updated only for few sessions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Powershell 2.0 breaking this by insert CR after each 80 chars in the string . So response not parsed correctly . <p> Possible workarounds:1 . Update Guest machine to Powershell 4.0 ( here ) .2 . Update extencion to shorten first and last string to something like " Start : extensionId " and " End : extensionId " , so it wo n't exceed 80 chars and would be parsed correctly once returned by any Windows machine . <p> I 'm actually not able to reproduce on my Windows 7 machine , but it 's an easy enough fix . I 've updated the strings to be shorter and published a new version ( 1.1.2 ) . Once it 's approved , these settings will be less than 80 characters with the session I 'd included . <p> In the meantime , you can manually edit those strings can be edited on the Admin &gt; Appearance page in these two Web LONG ... <p> 0 in those will be replaced with the extension 's I 'd ( this allows cloning the extension and them not running into issues with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1.1.2 : <p> LONG ... Update session with the following LONG ... Update session with preceeding information . <p> Really only the first of those lines is checked when running the extension , so I took the extension I 'd out of the second . <p> UPDATE ! <p> 1.1.2 might be 1.2.0 soon ... found a problem on 6.1 ( in alpha pre-release now ) where it will change the settings in memory , but they are n't written to the DB . Investigating , holding up that release until I find out why and get a fix in . <p> Using this extension , would it be possible to grab information from a ScreenConnect session that was launched from LabTech to change the name of the computer from the default $computername$ to : $ComputerName$ - $CustomerName$We have servers that share the same name ( SERVER1 ) and my engineers are finding it hard to keep track of which client they are connected to when they have 10 windows open that all say SERVER1 . <p> " " " When first building the access installer , it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builder 's fields , which will work for Windows Vista and newer OSes , and Windows XP if you side-load SETX . " " " <p> I take this to mean that in vanilla Screenconnect you can pull info from System variables and add them to a Custom Property at install by setting it up correctly under the ' Build + ' dialogue . This only happens at install time and does n't update . <p> This is exactly what I am trying to accomplish , I would like CustomPropery3 to pull the current system time as a way to keep track of the " Install Date " of particular Screenconnect sessions . <p> Under the ' Build + ' dialog I have tried to set CustomProperty3 to ' %date% ' and ' date ' , but it just sets the custom property to that exact string . ( ie ' %date% ' and ' date ' when I expect ' Fri 01/20/2017 ' ) <p> Thanks for the inquiry . Currently it does not modify session notes at all , but it would n't be too hard to refactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll take a look into it when I get some more time , but basically I use the UpdateSession API LONG ... to update the session info . The notes would just need to use the AddSessionEvent LONG ... <p> Note , I would probably make it so that that it would just add a new note each time it 's run as opposed to trying to keep a single note up to date , as that is where custom properties are really useful . <p> I 'm not a powershell guru but I 'm curious if there would be any way to use this to set it to show , say , CustomProperty4 as the last boot time . My residentials are terrible at rebooting so , rather than running " net statistics workstation find /i " statistics since " " from the Command Toolbox on the whole set and then having to look at each one 's CMD tab individually , it could populate one field so that I could see a bunch at a time . <p> I guess the problem might be that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinstalled to force an update . Is that right ? <p> With the newest version of Screen Connect 6.2.12963.6312 , it now appears on 64bit Window OS the extension is running in Powershell 64bit , previously it was running in Powershell 32bit still . Is there anyway to stay use 32bit Powershell so I can use " **32;4943;TOOLONG " ? <p> I 'm not a powershell guru but I 'm curious if there would be any way to use this to set it to show , say , CustomProperty4 as the last boot time .

You can check the commands tab for when the response comes in.A short second or so after it comes in , the Custom Propety 4 should be updated for the system ... <p> *** NOTE : While testing this , I did find a bug or two . The first is that clicking Save Settings &amp; Run Command does save the settings , and attempts to run the command , but does not close the modal prompt , and does not update the commands for the current view of the page ( at least in 6.3 ) . I 'll be working on getting this working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( again , at least in 6.3 , need to test previous versions to find where it started ) while the data is updated in the controller on the server , and therefore page data will show the changes to the sessions , this change does not seem to get committed to the database , as a restart of the services ( such as when upgrading the server ) causes the changes to the items to be reverted . Also reporting does not reflect the changes . I 'll be working on this as well for the next version .

@@96443628 @643628/ <p> I would like to be able to do file transfers without being required to have an active session to a client.Reasons why are mostly that I 'm not disturbing somebody who is working behind that pc , and that person is not disturbing me ( by clicking cancel on the file transfer ) . <p> As an addition , if this is run from admin scope and not logged in scope , we would be able to read and write files on locations the current logged in user can not get to , because currently we first have to browse to a directory before we can send / receive files to / from that directory . <p> This is a great idea ! for the reason explained above : to avoid disturbing remote user and do transfer files on the fly .

@@96443629 @643629/ <p> I 'm about to begin the process of moving Screenconnect to a new server . I 've read over the walkthrough but I 'm a little unsure of how to go about ensuring that my existing clients will be able to find my new installation . Specifically the URL mapping mentioned in the final step . I want to get everything ready and in order before I begin the move to avoid as much disruption as possible . <p> The first thing I would check is go to a few of my different unattended clients and look to see where they are calling back . If calling back to a nice DNS name then the switch over is pretty simply . Just role up the new installation ( same version as existing install ) , move over the files ( copy/paste to the new server ) , and then go to your DNS hosting and switch the IP the DNS resolves to . This should result in all the unattended clients calling in to that address and the DNS service re-routing them to the new machine . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything going gray on the old installation . <p> If your installations are calling back to an IP address then you would need to try and move that IP address to the new machine . If not another option could be to just create a new installation file and deploy through toolbox , Group Policy , or similar method . There are probably a few other options out there that community or our team could assist with if this is your situation . <p> Prepping thee setup should be just getting it up and working , run a few support sessions to make sure its all visible and working with outside world and then change over the DNS . Make sure you have moved over the file structure before changing DNS because unattended clients will try to validate their public/private key before connecting . <p> Thanks for the quick response . I 'm looking at one of my clients now and seeing an IP listed under the " relay server " section of the status window . That means I 've got to look at moving the IP or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the cleanest way to do this if you are using an IP address URL . Loading up the new installation , creating a DNS name , and then redeploying the clients via toolbox or some other method . Where the new client is using a DNS name as opposed to IP address . By default the unattended clients use the URL in your browser when you create the client to determine what URL you would like for them to call back to and the port from relay setup area of web.config . <p> Now that said a relatively unsupported/untested option that you could consider is manual modification to the registry . If you click on an unattended in your list you will see that the URL has a very long session I 'd . If you search for that I 'd in the registry you will find the ScreenConnect unattended entry ( probably a couple ) . The path the unattended calls back is stored there along with the ports . I have not personally tried editing this to see if it works but it should and according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few entries as I mentioned under the **25;5150;TOOLONG and ControlSet001 or maybe 002 . I would think the CurrentControlSet has to be changed and the other may or may not . Restarting the machine or our services after that should allow the unattended to call back to the new URL . <p> So depending on how many unattended clients you have it may be easier to just redeploy the client . Or you might want to install a client locally that you can play with on your machine or another machine to see if perhaps you can define a script or something that would help with these changes . Maybe a community member has something already written . I know there is at least one post on this but not sure it will work with latest versions : LONG ... <p> As I understand it , the URL or IP of the relay server is set at the point of creating the unattended installer , is this correct ? The problem we have is that even though the browser address has a URL , when I look in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check " in the admin area , all I see are IP addresses . We are hosting this on AWS at the moment , I suspect this is causing the problem ? So it seems that when we create the installer it puts in an IP address even though my browser shows a URL <p> I have just tested this . Logged into the dashboard with a URL , created an installer , ran it on my PC , and the relay server shows an IP address . Have you come across this before ? Is there any other way of forcing the installer to use a specific URL without registry changes ? We have approx 100 unattended installs across 25 clients <p> Yes , we should be able to fix that for you . The application should always use the browser 's address unless there is a RelayAddressableUri set in the web.config . Can we arrange a session to take a look at this on your server ? If so , just shoot me an email to **25;5177;TOOLONG ( and re . this forum post , if you will ) and we can get a session scheduled .

I 've been searching the forums for two hours and have n't found anything quite like this in any of the tips and tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if so , how would I go about making this " universal " installer ? <p> We 're making it possible to easily turn a support session into an access session in 6.1 . Once you try to install an access agent on the machine currently connected to a support session , the build installer will appear so you may rename the session and complete any addition fields you may have , but I am not sure if the naming setup you follow ( " Public.IP - MachineName " ) can populate the name field automatically . <p> Actually , that will work just fine if it 's getting named by the technician right away . I 've seen that other users keep a generic installer file in their toolbox for this process , but that 's very cumbersome to work with , especially if multiple technicians are installing permanent access at the same time . I was just looking for a way to do that but have some sort of unique identification that is also something that we can reference to rename the sessions in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " build installer " dialog , and build more than one " generic " , they can go to the same " session group " with dynamic subgroups based on the additional CustomPropertyX assigned . ( i.e. that custom property relating to the tech ) . <p> Note : I 'm assuming you are connected to a NON-Admin windows credential ( like standard user/low lvl account ) , if remote pc is logged in as admin credential , it should n't be any problem from where you install it from . <p> What I saw is , in order to install a permanent installation from temp connection you need 4 things : <p> 2- Get the UAC down to zero . It will block your side of the screen asking dumb questions and you wo n't go further from there . ( for me , in fact , UAC is totally useless , virus/malware pass it so easily , users wo n't ) . That 's way I always disable it right from the beginning in any pc I touch . <p> 3- . exe files must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's credential ( specially if it is not admin lvl ) . i.e : c : xxxxfolder , not c : users .... This is ESSENTIAL . It 's about access lvl as well . <p> After that , it 's done . As you can see , in this way , it ALWAYS works for me . But you need those 4 steps . <p> So , IDK how you guys can actually make it work , AT LEAST you can try change the ' toolbox ' default location as I mentioned above , however , if the user 's credential is NOT admin , you will run with the same problem , I guess .

This would help punch through restrictive firewalls and bypass proxy servers . <p> I got this to work by just using a simple firewall rule and some tampering with web.config to generate a unattended installation file with another port . <p> So in your router/firewall you will have a few port forwarding rules . If you have n't changed screenconnects default port numbers then they will be port 8040 and 8041 and a typical rule would look like this : <p> ( you can keep both rules active so that old/current clients and the " new " clients with more restrictive firewalls can both be accessed ) <p> Now you just need a new unattended client setup so head into your screenconnect base folder and edit web.config .

The way ive done is to make a separate webpage where I 've linked the regular unattended installation file ( which connects on 8041 ) and then the other one which connects on 443 and thus can be used on places where more restrictive firewalls apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can change relay port with this guide LONG ... but its not viable for everyone since not every unattended installation is online at the same time and its also a rather tedious and timeconsuming task to reinstall every client . <p> As others have mentioned , this would be handy for getting traffic through excessively-restricted routers .

The cost to upgrade today ( a month in advance of the annual renewal date ) is 19.45% of our licence cost .

Maybe a folder or file I missed ? <p> I will make another attempt at the procedure during the wee hours tonight , hopefully with better results . <p> Those were the documents I used to outline the procedure . I guess some guidance on where the client application icons are stored would help me narrow down what is n't getting transferred properly .

@@96443653 @643653/ <p> Thanks for posting on the forums ! You could put your software into a folder called " Software " like you have it and then make a file called something like " Software.aspx " right in your ScreenConnect parent folder ( c : Program Files ( x86 ) **26;5332;TOOLONG ) and put this code into the file : <p> It will make a very basic list of the contents of that folder with links to those files . It also checks that the user is authenticated to the site ( any authentication will do , does n't actually need any SC permissions ) . To change the directory , just change the " Software " something else ( like " AppData/Toolbox " for example to allow access to the shared toolbox this way ) . <p> On a note to something I mentioned earlier , you can get it to list the contents of the toolbox , but downloading directly from it is blocked by default . To get around this you could move your toolbox outside of the AppData folder by modifying the &lt;add key= " ToolboxDirectoryPath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , or create a " hard link " on your server to the toolbox directory from outside it , or something like that . For example , I ran this command from an elevated command prompt inside my " software " folder that this code points to get access to my toolbox folder:mklink /d Toolbox " C : Program Files ( x86 ) **27;5360;TOOLONG " <p> What I would n't recommend is changing the settings blocking " GET " access to the AppData Directory . <p> The scroll bar really just requires adding some in-line styling ( see the body element ) . Note that this may not work on some mobile devices ( you 're on your own on getting that one to work ; ) <p> As for the Subdirectory type structure , I 've modified the page to call itself for directories and just pull in the files for the current directory , so you can navigate through it . It 's not the prettiest thing in the world , but it 's functional . Hope this helps some others as well .

@@96443655 @643655/ <p> As I have been using ScreenConnect for some time I started writing some small helper programs.In the spirit of idea exchange and to help others not to have to do the same work all over I 've decided to share them with you . <p> Here 's the first ( really small ) tool that may help some of you out there : <p> ScreenConnect SupportTool is a simple browser window to allow quick access to the ScreenConnect Session List : <p> Distribution:To allow for individual distribution the . exe file is launched with the URL to the ScreenConnect Site as parameter.This offers two possibilities for distribution:1 .

@@96443657 @643657/ <p> The Query Session Recordings extension allows a ScreenConnect Administrator to get a list of only Extended Auditing Session Recordings with the ability to download them in a fashion similar to how the Audit page works . In addition to the standard " from " and " to " date range as seen on the Audit page , there is also the option to filter by Session Name or I 'd . This does support wildcard characters , which is * by default , but can be changed in the Extension 's settings . <p> There are two ways to access the extension . First is on the Admin &gt; Extensions tab by clicking " Options " for this extension , and then " Query Session Recordings " . The other is by navigating to Admin &gt; Audit and then clicking the " Extras " menu on 5. x , or your Username in the lower left corner of the left Navigation Panel on 6.0 , and selecting " Query Session Recordings " . <p> The modal window will have a field for Session Name / I 'd filtering and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank , it will still work , just without said filter .

I also use report manager along with the Spanish translation and several other extensions . The report manager launches from the Extras menu without issues , and under the development tools I can see that it posts back to the same page .. That postback does not happen for this extension on our system . <p> Asy suggestions for getting it working ? ( Could there be some kind of conflict with other extensions ) <p> I tinkered with it a bit and the problem seems to relate to retrieving the values from the audit form fields . I commented that part out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking some more I think the names/IDs of the form fields were changed between 5.3 and 5.6 making the original references invalid . <p> While looking at the source code I realized I can leverage this to do something else we need .

We 've made groups which conveniently let us drop into a specific customer to see the list of their systems . While the Search system is very handy , there are times where we ca n't know precisely which machine we 're looking for yet . Sometimes we 're just looking for " the computer that just booted up two minutes ago " , for instance . Sometimes there could be a typo in the spelling of the user 's name , making Search fail . Things like that , where simply browsing the list of machines is highly useful . <p> Well , we 're getting enough different customers , some of which have a relatively few machines . Our MISC group is getting big . For us , it would be nice to be able to have MISCCUSTOMER1 , MISCCUSTOMER2 , and so on , for those relatively infrequently used , small accounts . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd be nice to be able to do something similar . Being able to collapse the MISC area to not chew up list space would be great . <p> +1I would also love it if we could have a time column as when the machines last logged on , so we could sort by time ! Really useful if we have just installed screenconnect on a couple of new machines ! <p> I made a group with session filter " NOT $OTHEROR " which will put ungrouped connections in its own group so that you later can edit and put them into their corresponding organizations . That would perhaps work for you ? : ) <p> Like others , I have a lot of customers , ( over 1000 systems among 100 or more customers ) . Many of these customers have multiple locations ( CustomerADallas , CustomerAHouston , CustomerAAustin ) for example . While we have implemented CustomProperty2 ( and in some cases CustomProperty3 ) , we have way too many groups and having to scroll around to find the correct group is a time loss , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ad-hoc . <p> We moved over from Logmein primarily due to the pricing , but even there , the grouping issue was a pain in Central . I bet that if this feature was implemented very soon , it would be a major draw for others to come from Logmein as well . I estimated that I spend an extra 25 bucks a week in payroll for my guys searching through the group list . <p> I was trying to implement it myself but have n't had luck . By opening the labtech extension I can see that it uses this section to grab the organization which I assume labtech somehow passes along from its %clientname% variable .

@@96443676 @643676/ <p> In the past when we were looking at ScreenConnect to replace LogMeIn , we ran into one snag . We used the feature in LogMeIn that allows us to invite our customers to our account to allow them to remote into their own computers . When we inquired about this in ScreenConnect , we were told that this is specifically NOT allowed in their licensing agreement , and that only people in our company can use the ScreenConnect server that we have setup . If the customer wanted to use ScreenConnect , they would need their own ScreenConnect system . We had heard that people were still doing this , by using the security features in Screen Connect to limit specific logins to specific machines , but we were n't interested in setting something up not allowed by the license . We settled on lowering our LogMeIn.com contract , but keeping it around for our end users . <p> Apparently this position banning clients from using ScreenConnect is no longer true . In the latest version of LabTech , they have added a feature , Remote WorkForce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to their assigned machines using ScreenConnect ! We can now finally ditch LogMeIn !

Please allow us to enable remote printing on demand . Others have requested this , but now that end users are potentially in the picture , it is now even more important . <p> Ideally printer mapping would default to OFF , but give us the ability from the client application to enable it on demand . <p> Instead of starting a new thread , I was going to tag this onto the others that have requested this , but there seems to be so many threads asking for this , that I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that it might have gone unnoticed as since the devs have given us the ability to globally turn it off , they might consider the request fulfilled .

I recently came up with an idea for a companion-tool to ScreenConnect that ended up being quite handy for supporting end-users in my experience , so I thought I 'd upload and share it . <p> Background/Goal : On the Host page of the web interface , input sent to the " Commands " Tab of any Windows Guest , is executed on the machine via the ScreenConnect service , which results in the command being executed as the SID " NT AuthoritySYSTEM " . This is not a problem , however I wanted to also be able to send commands to the Guest and have them be executed within the interactive user session ( Console Session ) of the machine , as the user who is currently logged in to that session , whoever that might be at that point . I found that from time to time , I needed to execute certain commands as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to without connecting into the session and taking physical control of the user 's session / using the toolbox . Description : The console program I wrote to accomplish this is called " rpau.exe " ( Run Process As User ) . It was written in PureBasic 5.41 , and accomplishes this goal with very small footprint on the system ( 19kb ) . I placed a copy of it in the C : Windows directory ( PATH ) to be able to run it from the Command Tab by simply calling it by name : C : Windowssystem32&gt;rpau Error : No Options / Parameters Given . Run Process As User v0.32.131 Syntax1 : rpau.exe --hidden " &lt;ProgramName&gt; " " &lt;CmdLineArgs&gt; " " &lt;WorkingDirectory&gt; " : You can optionally include " --hidden " to visibly hide the executed : program . Enclose parameters in double-quotes as shown . : The only required parameter is &lt;ProgramName&gt; . However , if you want : to specify &lt;WorkingDirectory&gt; without specifying &lt;CmdLineArgs&gt; , : &lt;CmdLineArgs&gt; must still be passed as : " " . ( Empty String ) . Example : rpau.exe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C : ProgramData " Syntax2 : rpau.exe --username : Returns the Username of the account in the Console Session . No : Additional Parameters Expected . Example : rpau.exe --username There are currently 2 " modes " it works in . The program can only be run from the SYSTEM account , and will do nothing except exit if launched as a normal user . ( Security/Redundant Use Case ) - Syntax 1 is for running a process as the user in their session , with the option of suppressing the visibility of any windows with --hidden. ( ' --hidden ' option is for running things like batch scripts , etc. without visually interrupting the user , or running the risk of stealing their window focus . ) It is basically a command-line interface to the CreateProcess() API ( ProgramName , Arguements , WorkingDirectory can be specified ) , while impersonating the logged on user in an environment block . - Syntax 2 returns printed information to the Command Tab , specifically the username of the account which is logged in to the console session . ScreenConnect already provides this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See Screenshots Folder for Examples ) Limitations/ToDo : - Currently , does not support Terminal-Services style configurations ( More than one concurrent console session ) . I plan to add an option to enumerate the WTS Sessions , and to select which one specifically to direct the commands to , but have n't had time to yet . - Plan to add other options to perform other actions as the user . <p> It is a pretty short program at this point , so it should n't be too difficult to translate to other languages . If you do not have access to a PureBasic compiler , a binary is available at the Git . <p> Sorry for the delay , seems I keep getting locked out of my account here ... <p> Anyways , the error you describe indicates that the program is not successfully calling the Windows API " **29;5843;TOOLONG , lpTokenHandle ) " <p> The only way I can reproduce this error is if there is no user signed into an ' interactive ' or ' physical ' session on the machine . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass to this function . Is there a user signed in when you try to run the command ? <p> The error is happening because line 36 is failing in the below source . The only in parameter ( I believe ) is " dwSessionId " , so it depends on having a user logged in . Also , if this is a terminal-services ( rds ) machine , it may not work as expected , because I do not enumerate all/multiple sessions , only the first interactive user session . I may add support for this in the future if it becomes a need . <p> However it does nothing .

@@96443689 @643689/ <p> This morning I was connected to my home pc using screen connect when I was suddenly kicked off . When I tried to reconnect I received the following error " Database Disk Image is Malformed Error " . Any help ? <p> The error is pretty descriptive , it means that the database has become corrupt . There are a number of ways this can happen ranging from improper service/process shutdown to a power loss . If you have a recent backup of the Session.db file you can try to restore from that . <p> If you do n't have a backup you can also just delete the Session.db file . Deleting the database does mean losing some data , but it does not mean that you will have to manually reinstall your Access clients . The Session.db just contains a record of Session activity , not the session 's themselves . If you delete it , ScreenConnect will simply recreate it as the Session 's call back into the server . <p> To do this , stop the ScreenConnect services . Find the Session.db file within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Program Files ( x86 ) ScreenConnect by default ) . Once located , delete the Session.db file and then restart the services . <p> Alternatively , our Support team has a diagnostic tool that we wrote which might be successful in restoring the database without losing data . I honestly can not say that I 've seen it work more than a small handful of times , but it might be worth a shot .

I will need to try the batch file - like Zoda shared in post #7 of that post . I did n't find that conversation when I searched the forum.If it works as described it will be useful - not all of my customers would need this , but there are certainly many who do - some get creeped out by remote access and others just like to know they are still in control . <p> The on demand access is fine , but as mentioned by some , its not very convenient - once I get this integrated into my website that will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand is a permanent link . Using competition as example - TeamviewerQS has been most convenient for totally as needed connection without need to go thru an email or webpage each time . I suppose a workaround for this would be to have a generic session always available and create a shortcut to the webpage of that session.I need to test to see what happens when multiple clients try to connect to same session - once one person is connected would the other people NOT see the session as available ? <p> This would be what I would think would happen , but recently this did NOT happen when I needed a customer to switch to another computer , the 2nd connection showed her the successfully connected message , yet I was still connected to the 1st computer . Perhaps if I was able to eject the 1st computer on my end , I would have been able to connect to the 2nd ? I will test more - sorry for spinning off my own topic again .

@@96443694 @643694/ <p> My company has been a ScreenConnect supporter for many years , and for now we are sticking with the product despite the changes in ownership and pricing . I have never had reason to complain much ( aside from the automatic printer install fiasco ) , until now . <p> We have been upgrading some of our older virtualization servers , and at the same time the VMs running on them . Our ScreenConnect server used to be hosted on a older standalone ESXi Xeon server with 24GB ram and local SSD storage . The VM on the server that ran Screenconnect had 1GB of RAM a 2 vCPU cores , and ran Windows 2k3 . It actually ran great , hosting with Screenconnect was glass smooth , even if we used all 4 of our concurrent sessions at once . <p> The we have a 1Gbps dedicated fiber connection to the internet ( obviously used for other purposes then just Screenconnect ) . We used Screenconnect for two purposes , external help desk style support ( clients phoning us ) , and internal computer maintenance for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We found it quite efficient to setup 3-4 computers on the bench , quickly add the Screenconnect client to them then allow our techs to work from their own desks , while taking calls , and working on other tasks . In the second scenario it was pretty much like working on the computers directly even with full color ( high ) quality , the internet was not a bottleneck as the techs were connecting to systems that were local across a gigabit network . ie. bandwidth was never an issue <p> When we upgraded our ESXi standalone system we moved to a 3 server cluster config . Each machine has 32GB of ram , the processors are newer Xeon models , and the storage system is now shared , backed with SSD , and running 10Gbps interconnect to each server . We spread the existing VMs across the 3 nodes . The VM running Screenconnect now has 8GB Ram , 4 vCPUs and if we test the storage bandwidth from within the VM is it approx 2x the speed as before . <p> However , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discontinued to move to a Linux based Screenconnect Server install . We are now using CentOS 7 instead of Win2k3 . Despite the much more powerful hardware , Screenconnect preforms very poorly . I mean it works , connecting has never had an issue , but for example moving windows around , clicking on items , the screen refreshes are just slower . We have monitored load , and it is negligible on the VM and host hypervisor . It does not matter if we are connecting local or across the internet to a client , it is terrible . Setting the quality to Low does very little to help . The easiest way to explain it , was that under Win2k3 when connected locally with Screenconnect you could watch a video on the client and on the host computer it would playback without issue , almost as if you were watching it on the client system directly . With Linux as the ScreenConnect server this is n't possible , not even close . <p> It has become very bothersome , and is impeding productivity . I am assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses . Is there anything that can be done to fix this issue ? <p> I hate the idea of going from Windows to Linux only to switch back because of an issue that is out of my control . If this is not fixable , and just a result of using Linux then the developers should let users know that performance under Windows is vastly superior to that of Linux . <p> Just an FYI . I am running SC 5.6 on a Vultr VPS with 1GB RAM , 20GB SSD on Ubuntu 15.04 x64 . I only have two licenses , but I can run both and they are very fast .

As a curiosity have you ever run Screenconnect Server on a Windows machine ? <p> I ask because when I searched the forum for Linux performance I could not really find people that switched . I can understand this , why change when it is working , but my point is if I started with Linux I would not be making the post as I would have no idea that performance in Windows any different . <p> I have been looking into ASP . NET performance of Mono and Windows and everything I find is showing that Microsoft 's . NET performance is an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mono 's performance across different Linux distros . I 'll take a look at that . <p> I previously ran on Windows Server 2008 . The last SC version I ran on Windows was 5.1 . I had no issues running on Windows and I do n't recall any speed differences either way . My main reason for moving it to externally hosted VPS was for security reasons , to eliminate inbound connections to my internal server . That is not to say I have security concerns with hosting SC , I just did n't want to DMZ a server or VM host internally . At $7 for the Vultr VPS why not . I was actually running the $5 per month entry level VPS , same OS , with 768MB RAM and bumped to the 1GB to run some other hosting options on it as well . Very east to move install from on host to another , especially if you can keep the IP the same , so it may be worth testing out some other distros . <p> I setup a Debian 8.3 VM with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install of ScreenConnect , everything at defaults . It preformed identical to the CentOS VM , so no improvement . I have dug out my old Win2k3 server licenses . I am in the process of installing the OS , I am not looking forward to doing the updates all over again . Serves me right for removing our Win2k3 Templates from our hypervisor . <p> Once the Win2k3 machine is up and running I am going to try Screenconnect , I will report back my findings . <p> So I have a Win2k3 VM ( 32-bit ) with 4 vCPUs and 2 GB Ram . This is running on the same cluster as the Debian and CentOS VMs , so outside of the RAM quantity the VMs are using the same physical hardware , and the same VM hardware . I installed ScreenCconnect , and connected one of my work computers to the new ScreenConnect install , sure enough it runs beautifully , much much better . <p> I even connected to the same machine twice , once using the CentOS , and once with the Win2k3 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no comparison , the ScreenConnect session running through the windows server just simply out preforms the Linux system . <p> Would love to get official feedback from someone at **25;5930;TOOLONG to either confirm or deny , or even better provide a solution for the Linux performance . I can post a video capture of what I and referring to if requested . <p> Approximately how many Access sessions do you have ? Typically , the difference between running on Linux and Windows should be fairly negligible ; however , ScreenConnect was initially designed as a Windows application and only works on Linux by running under Mono and we have found that mono does not scale that well . So the more concurrent sessions you have running or the more Access sessions that you deploy can impact the overall performance on Linux . <p> Approximately how many Access sessions do you have ?

@@96443696 @643696/ <p> This thread describes a problem I 'm seeing on a few client computers . The computers are slow to start and thus the ScreenConnect Client will sometimes not start , requiring a reboot or manual service start to be able to assist . As you can imagine , the people that need this type of support typically ca n't start a service on their own ( even with a shortcut on the desktop that will do it for them ) , so they end up having to reboot . This makes troubleshooting their problems a major challenge . <p> I 've been able to pin down the problems on a few of the computers . One has a failing DSL modem , so SC ca n't always communicate with the server , and networking-related services that also start ( such as hp scanner detection and google drive ) choke and cause delays that then choke SC . The others have other slow-to-start services like WD SmartWare . <p> I 've changed the startup type to " Automatic ( Delayed Start ) " as advised in the other thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with service settings being reset on an upgrade and would like to avoid that . <p> What I would like is to be able to guarantee these unattended sessions on these computers were n't at risk of not being accessible just because they were slow to start or had an unreliable connection . I wrote a batch script ( included below ) that changes the startup to delayed and ensures the service is restarted on failure . However , if these options are going to be overwritten during each update to the SC Client , I 'd like to know if there 's a way to prevent that , or ensure that my settings are preserved without having to flag various machines as slow start and come back to them each time to run the script . <p> We to have seen these issues and agree it would be great to have service recovery/install/delay options built in for installs and pushing upgrades to clients . We have similar batch/cmd files for this . We have seen SC completely disappear off a computer as well ( after a Windows update or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) Anyway , one is for service delay/recovery etc and one to reinstall and call the other for delay/recovery etc .. if needed after calling the client to run these files . So some sort of addon for the right click menu option in SC for Reinstall with a check box to load custom settings or something for these options .

I see two instances of **40;5995;TOOLONG running in Task Manager after my usual routine . While I connect via my Access session , one takes up 50-100MB RAM , the other 3-10MB . They both startup on a reboot . <p> I guess a clarifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's machine to remove the program and stops the Support session ? I 'll test it on a virgin machine in a couple of days to be more scientific about it . But it seems to me there is something I 'm doing that 's causing more than one of those executables to keep starting up upon reboot . <p> After my post , I did another session with a new customer , and this time , being more mindful , I connected via my Access session right after I disconnected from the Support session . The customer gets a message stating ( paraphrasing ) " The support session has ended and now you 're no longer connected . " This was comforting ... so I checked task manager , and in this case only ONE executable was still running ... which seems right . The only thing I did differently this time around was I did NOT end the support session via the web interface--I ended it on MY machine through the yes/no dialog asking whether or not I wanted to keep the support session open . Maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support session through the web interface , while also connecting via an access session to the same machine , causes the customer 's machine to continually run both exe 's ? <p> FYI : The pre-built installer in the toolbox is how I 've been installing the Access session executable . <p> My workflow:1 ) Get customer on support session2 ) Install Access session via toolbox3 ) Check that computer is online in Access section4 ) Close the support session via the X in the top right corner and then pressing Y ( Yes ) to end the support session5 ) Reconnect via Access/unattended session <p> My workflow:1 ) Get customer on support session2 ) Install Access session via toolbox3 ) Check that computer is online in Access section4 ) Close the support session via the X in the top right corner and then pressing Y ( Yes ) to end the support session5 ) Reconnect via Access/unattended session <p> I have EXACTLY the same issue .... <p> Not only that but ( maybe I am missing something ) the customer can end unattended sessions at will and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUGE issue .

@@96443706 @643706/ <p> I have been using SC for some time . When first configured I used a DynDns free Hostname as I did n't have a static IP .

@@96443707 @643707/ <p> Overall we 're very happy SC users . We 've replaced our Go2Assist subscription that we used for remote tech support . However , after all this time , we 're still having trouble getting connected ( FAST ) with basic end users . While it 's very easy ( 1 or 2 steps ) usually it 's hard to explain . That said I have the following questions : <p> Does anyone have a Helpdesk SOP that will help easily explain to users how to connect to the session because between UAC prompts and various Anti-Virus blocks on SC it sometimes takes 5-10 minutes just to connect . <p> any tips would be greatly appreciated ! <p> ( We 're already created a separate " easy " domain name that forwards to our SC Server site ) <p> It might be - all depends . key is managing the 2 or 3 different UAC prompts in a " basic session " and as a helpdesk employee walking them thru it since each browser is slightly different and not all users know how to run something from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click Join . When they do , you should see an event pop up in the timeline indicating they 've initiated the session . If you point at that red dot , a tooltip will pop up and give you all kinds of useful information , including OS version , browser , and agent type ( ClickOnce Direct , ClickOnce Run , Java , etc ) . <p> Armed with that information it is much easier to give users more specific directions . Generally with IE , ClickOnce Direct will usually pop up the prompt to run the applet . If the user got click happy though , and refocused the IE window , sometimes that pops up in the background instead . If they do n't see the ClickOnce prompt , I usually just have them click " Try next option ... " which will fall back to ClickOnce Run . From there they just need to run the . exe , and possibly confirm the . net prompt to run the application , and they should be connected . <p> Chrome is stupid easy , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save downloads . Have them enter the code , and the " Elsinore.ScreenConnect ... " exe should start downloading on the bottom of the window . They just have to click it and click Run . My first time attempt success rate is nearly 100% with Chrome users . <p> Then there 's Firefox , which is just a royal PITA . Generally , if someone is trying to connect with Firefox , I ask them to switch to IE. <p> The main problem I 've had is that all the browsers have added built-in " potentially unsafe " detection which as far as I can tell must use some database that logs how common an executable is ( probably with some added signatures to detect known malware ) . The browsers are now purposefully making it difficult for novice users to actually download and run anything that does n't " pass " this check , and therein lies the problem ( because , of course , these are the very users that need hand-holding to get the session started ) . <p> It would be really nice if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure how because the nature of remote access is that it certainly could be used for malware . Nothing is stopping someone from using ScreenConnect software as the basis for a backdoor malware infection especially since the server is self-hosted . <p> Just train of thought ... it would be neat if there could be some type of service that gets implemented by the major browsers with the ability for a download to trigger a prompt for a simple code ( could be short as 4 digits ) . If the code is correctly entered by the user it would bypass any additional " safety " checks and run as normal . <p> The technician could access the service to get the current code that needs to be communicated to the user . The API for this code generator could even be built-in to ScreenConnect so the technician does n't have to go anywhere else to get it . <p> I know it 's a pipe dream , but it would sure make things easier . I do n't know how much help the browser hurdles are anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking people through all sorts of things these days ... <p> Yes , UAC and security prompts from browsers and AV trip up some of my 1st time clients . Even in Chrome , many do n't know where the downloaded files appear . My idea of simple session joining would be along the lines of the Chrome browser install from IE. On a machine without Chrome installed , go to chrome.google.com in a IE and click on Download Chrome , and it 's seamless . Maybe ScreenConnect can reverse engineer this installer and make the Elsinore client run as easily . <p> When someone ca n't find the file they 've downloaded , asking them to hit **25;6037;TOOLONG invariably works - that shortcut opens the ' Downloads ' window/tab in all three browsers . " What 's at the top of that list ? ... yeah , double click on that ! " <p> Our team purchased a short and straightforward domain name similar to goto assists fastsupport.com . We direct clients to the URL , advise them to hit join and usually stipulate a blanket statement of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that pops up for this program " . I 've only experienced 1 or two users who have significant issues with this while the vast majority have been able to navigate with little to no issues . <p> I have the same problem as the initiator of this thread and I feel it is getting worse . Recently I was trying to help someone who ran Google Chrome ( without the clickonce plugin ) on Windows 8 . First Chrome said the executable could be dangerous and the user had to click the little down-arrow next to Cancel and choose ' Keep anyway ' . Then they ran the executable and Windows SmartScreen kicked in . To circumvent this you need to click ' More info ' and then click ' Run anyway ' on a screen that also tells you that the app may put your computer at risk . Then finally they will have to click OK on the security warning about running a downloaded executable . This is a very troublesome number of steps and some of my customers who can be 75+ years old are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hinted improvements in version 5 and if they are indeed significant this will definitely make me upgrade . Also I 'm wondering what is going to happen with the stand-alone self-service app that was briefly available from LONG ... -- This would be a possible solution for me , if I could leave an executable on the desktop of my customers when I 'm on location or preparing their computers . <p> I 'm having the same problem with my seniors . Getting them through the install process can be quite a chore . It 's difficult enough for them to enter a URL , then I have them install something that could be dangerous . <p> I just bought a domain with a very short ( 9 character ) name hoping that will make it easier . <p> If only I could figure out email invite configuration . That would make it so much easier for my seniors as they all know how to open email . <p> The email invite should be pretty straightforward . By default it will use whatever URL is in the browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are logging in with the short DNS name you bought then that would be the URL sent to your customer .

But if that was on a standard ad-hoc remote support session please contact our support team to look at this with you . <p> B ) There are some options that would allow you to install something on the guest machine that would help facilitate connections . Either permanent clients or 5.0 extensions that call in to our customer initiated join method come to mind . And there is a new client option that we are testing with technicians with 5.0 that could also work for guests . This would need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would have some footprint on the machine but would not give you unrestricted access . All of these options are in the process of being documented here : LONG ... <p> This guide still needs some work but its a starting point for explaining some of the different options today and will be completely updated by the time 5.0 releases . <p> I posted a feature request yesterday that I thought could also be relevant to this thread . <p> The basics of my feature request is to make it so the client installer will upgrade to the latest SC version that is available on the server . <p> Essentially what I would envision happening is that the client installer would become a stub installer that then downloads the actual install data from the SC server ( similar to what a large number of installers do these days ) . <p> The advantage specifically related to this thread is that it might allow for a particular stub installer to have a much longer lifespan ( spanning 10+ SC versions ) , and this could impact in a positive way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially unsafe downloads . The reason , of course , is because the same client installer could be used over a long timespan versus generating a new one each time the SC server is upgraded , thus making the file a little less " infrequently " used . <p> Thank you for the recommendation and feature idea . I will certainly pass this along to our development team to see what they think . A couple of thoughts jump out at me . <p> A ) One of our new extensions allows users to access Build Installer as well as pre-built clients based on current installation version . So if goal is to simplify what is in the toolbox or similar so that you always install the most current version these might be good things to look into . <p> B ) Some sort of generic installer has been discussed .

It could be something with signing , number of times seen , file whitelisting , specific settings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So I will find the other request in the forum but are you experiencing false positives ?

So if goal is to simplify what is in the toolbox or similar so that you always install the most current version these might be good things to look into . <p> My workflow tends to rely a lot more on sending links to the access installer , so the toolbox is not used much in my scenario for initial installation . <p> Originally Posted by : Jeff <p> B ) Some sort of generic installer has been discussed .

So it would appear , at least for me , that even a modest number of users who choose to " download it anyway " will positively affect the browser flags . Based on that theory , going with a stub installer should have an even bigger impact because the installer file would not be tied to a specific version . <p> It might be possible to make things even more generic as a last resort by having an option for a stub installer that does n't include any server info or customizations at all ( so the signature of the file would be the same for all SC installations ) . Upon running that installer it would prompt the user to enter the server domain or IP address ( which could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This file would be even less likely to be flagged as it should have a much larger footprint , though it would require the extra step to connect with the proper SC server . But again , it could be used in a situation where a client ca n't seem to make heads or tails of how to get around the browser or AV warnings . <p> Since switching to a remote support business model , I think our techs ( myself included ) are a little out of practice with walking customers through things over the phone . The most common hurdles we run into are the customer mistaking the instructions window ( which now includes pictures of various dialogs ) as the actual dialog , and the customer thinking that because it says " Joining " that they have to wait for something to finish before reacting . I 'm guessing the second problem can probably be solved via the GUI configuration , and the first problem may be avoided using the CTRL+J trick mentioned above . <p> We typically install the Access client via our toolbox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much of an issue on that front . <p> While the process could be made a little smoother , there will be no magic bullet the devs will be able to use for this . When dealing with novice users , there are always going to be outliers . Our average time from call pickup to successful support connection is 6 minutes . We had one the other day that was less than a minute , and we have at least one a week where it approaches an hour . When you have to explain terminology like " keyboard " and " screen " or what " click " means , you are going to be on the phone awhile , no matter how streamlined the process is . <p> When you have to explain terminology like " keyboard " and " screen " or what " click " means , you are going to be on the phone awhile , no matter how streamlined the process is . <p> Those are the times when you have to refrain from asking the customer to solve the problem by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But seriously , those are the situations where having an access client installed would be extremely helpful to prevent future connection woes . Someone as tech-naive as that would probably end up getting a trojan installed anyway ; might as well have a " good " trojan on the machine too . <p> If anybody finds this useful we changed the code on the page for the client to join so it always downloads the exe . That combined with a valid SSL certificate and we do n't get downloads flagged and always know what the user is seeing . We left the OSX settings on that page as is but it solved our issues on Windows machines . <p> So a couple of notes . If anyone has any suggestions on areas that were confusing our sales team ( sales@screenconnect.com ) would be more than happy to talk with you about it so we can look at ways to improve . One of the things we are working on now is changing the way some of our signing is done to hopefully reduce any AV or browser flags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might work better in some models . <p> First , Thank you everyone for contributing . I created this post several months back , and have n't looked back in a little while . <p> We 're still experiencing some issues connecting with users , A couple of obstacles to overcome . Again to restate , We currently user Screen Connect to work with clients who are n't on our " managed care package " or they need support on a device we do n't manage ( otherwise we connect with them thru or RMM ) ; and then of course SC is a backup to the RMM remote connection <p> 1 . UBK Error ( User Behind Keyboard ) - Once we make sure they 're " actually in the address bar " and not in a google search window ; then it 's " too many boxes to click " <p> 2 . AV - lately we 're having a lot of issues with AV getting in the way of creating a connection <p> 3 . The machine is already " Sick " - many of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise and the ' complex ' ( to the EU ) steps to create a session are enhanced by whatever malware they have in their system . <p> LMI Rescue does things a little different , or so I think -- maybe we can model that without too much problem . It can be a multi-step process , but at least , it 's " controlled " ; I 'm not sure how much of this is coding and how much is " putting on a show " , but.1 . Connect to session ( chat box , or some other confirmation ) , maybe that can be paired with screen viewing2 . Then whatever UAC passthrus the SC app does to allow remote control , etc. at least if we 're viewing the person 's screen we can walk them thru the rest a little easier. ( 3 . I 've failed trying to get clients to launch SC in safemode , but I belive LMI can ) . <p> In addition , or as an alternate , I think what we need is a good SOP for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bc we do n't what ( if ) browser they are using/if they have a support Java version etc . <p> Yea the UBK can be tough , something like the unattended or the new GuestSessionStarter.exe ( extension ) may help a lot there . A few other things we are testing like WindowsSelector we released for technicians may transition to guests at some point LONG ... I encourage anyone who has n't seen our new guide on connections take a look , its expanding quickly as we try new methods : LONG ... <p> Regarding AV we have done a lot of work in 5.1 to hopefully help with this . I can not say for sure how much as testing is still early . <p> There are also now extensions that can be added to guest page that would allow chatting between guests and techs . So its probably possible that some sort of screen capture could be added as well . I will add a note for our team who researches extensions . <p> I also assigned a task for someone to look at the safe mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my knowledge but its been a while since I used it in that manner . If you continue to have problems with that please contact our support team to do a session . I provided this forum post link as part of the task so they could update with their findings . <p> The SOP I would be happy to look at with you , our software tries to deploy the best connection possible based on their OS and browser . It also caches the method they last succesfully used for future connections . Pros of this is that if they connected then that should be the best method for them next time . Cons I guess is if we release a new method or re-organize methods they may not be using one of the newer better options unless clicking the ' try another option ' . But suggestions on SOP are very welcomed .

I sure hope there is a work around or fix for this soon . <p> Are you guys in service mode ? Is the **39;6064;TOOLONG process running on the machine ?

I checked Task Manager and I see the process **38;6146;TOOLONG . I have not been able to figure out how to change a Attended session to " Service mode " .

They were installed with an administrator-level user . Until I disabled UAC completely , I was stuck on those machines anytime I needed to add/remove/update applications . <p> I 'm sure it 's been explained here before , but could somebody explain what is meant by service mode ? How do we get our session or the screenconnect service ( on an unattended install ) to run in service mode ? <p> I do n't know if this is related or not -- I 've got a Win7 x64 machine on my workbench that I 'm connecting to remotely ( long story ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm migrating his old data over and setting it up . I got all the basics installed ( Java , Adobe Flash/Reader , Avast ) installed without problems . A half-hour ago , though , I stopped being able to even *see* the Consent windows popping up . At first , I thought it was locking up but now I realize that it had been on the screen and then timing out . <p> Does anyone have easy access to one of these machines ? If so , can you email us at **25;6186;TOOLONG so that we can try to arrange a session this week to replicate ? <p> In answer to sysadmin 's question regarding " service mode , " to be more specific about running in service mode , you need to be aware of Windows UAC and the way ScreenConnect handles UAC in Standard Sessions : <p> If the remote Guest user is an unelevated administrator , Windows UAC should prompt them for elevation to service mode when they start the guest client and join the session , and you should see and be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are not an administrator , we do n't bother to try to elevate , because to elevate , they 'd need to type in credentials . You can elevate yourself , however , by sending a CTRL+ALT+DEL from the File menu . Once you have elevated , ScreenConnect runs as a service and allows you to control all UAC prompts , reboot &amp; reconnect , switch users , etc . <p> You can elevate yourself , however , by sending a CTRL+ALT+DEL from the File menu .

Is there a way around the blank password issue ? <p> We fixed one manifestation of this , and that may fix everyone . It happened when UAC level was set to low in which case a UAC window pops up , but not the UAC window with the shaded background that we expect . This UAC window was not clickable . It will clickable in future 2.4 builds . <p> Sorry to drag up an old thread but I 'm having this issue on a Win7 64bit unattended session installation.We are on 2.4.2534.4477 . <p> I 'm trying to install some software remotely and during the installation it normally prompts with a UAC box however in this instance I do n't see the UAC prompt and the remote session appears to disconnect.If I wait for a couple of minutes the session comes back and the software has n't installed saying something about it being interrupted , which is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On other Win7 machines we also seem to have other issues with UAC in that it can take a long time for the UAC prompt to show up on our remote connection , maybe 20-30 seconds , and then we can click to accept it . <p> I ca n't replicate this . Do you have a machine on which you can reliably reproduce the problem ? If so , please shoot me an email to **25;6213;TOOLONG so that we can arrange a time for a support session to take a look at this issue . <p> Reid , I will take a look and see if I can replicate it within our environment . I have not given it a try yet internally . So far I have only been testing screen connect with clients and have issues with every machine for the last three days relating to this UAC thing . I will reply back with an email if I can get it replicated internally . Ca n't be testing it on a clients machine . <p> Ok we had a support call with Screenconnect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the JAVA and not the . net applet to connect to the client on the host and vice versa . We used Windows Internet Explorer on the Client machine and then made sure that we were using the . net on the host . Was able to click on all UAC prompts as long as the client user had admin rights . The elevating the user did n't work and they are working on a fix for that bug . So thanks ScreenConnect we can use the solution with our client remote support efforts again and am looking forward to the updated patch . <p> I 've read the latest blog post about UAC prompts and unfortunately the system I had issues with was an unattended install so screenconnect is already running as a service . When the UAC prompt comes up you could n't do anything it was like screenconnect was disconnected . Sending alt crtl del did nothing . You just had to wait a minute or two for windows to automatically cancel the UAC prompt . So this is still an issue . <p> Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the software from there so we ca n't test it again as the software is installed and running.Will keep an eye on it and see if it happens again with any other software . <p> When you first connect , send a CTRL+ALT+DEL to the computer . Depending on UAC - the user may be required to hit YES to a UAC message . Once this is done , you can type in an administrator username and password into a dialog that appears , and then the computer will go into the ' CTRL ALT DEL Options window ' ( not sure what you call it - but where you can choose taskmanager , or log off , etc ) - simply choose CANCEL . Hopefully now , you should be able to have full control over UAC prompts and elevated applications , etc until the session expires . <p> When you first connect , send a CTRL+ALT+DEL to the computer .

( I wo n't be upgrading until 5.6 is released as stable as I have n't wanted to deal with the delayed auto-start that was introduced in 5.4 ) <p> Doh ! That was purely my mistake , a typo in the &lt; 5.4 version code .

( I know I can globally adjust those settings but it would be much nicer if I could define them on a command by command basis . ) <p> On a related note , would it be possible to allow the Command Toolbox to support multi-line commands ? ( This would probably resolve the shabang modifier issue as well as make the Command Toolbox much more flexible . ) <p> It might depend upon what the exe is doing , as I just tested with a console exe with no UI output ( it emails ) using the following : <p> Code : <p> # ! ps #timeout=90000 C : **25;6240;TOOLONG <p> Also , upon further investigation , you can use Shift+Enter within the textarea to effectively make the command multi-line . <p> We 're still talking about the Command Toolbox extension right ?

They can be such a time saver . <p> Nothing solid yet , it 's still on my to-do list . The way it was implemented within that other Extension @KBrownConsulting mentioned is kind of hackish , I 'm instead looking at potentially changing the Extension Runtime itself to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not super happy with the implementation , but I 've added the ability to save multi-line commands to the Extension in version 1.43.21 , which should be available for download from the Library already . The reason I 'm not super happy with it is that it 's far from intuitive , the multi-line commands are saved from within the Command Toolbox modal on the Host page , similar to : <p> Overloading the already-present Edit Extension Settings modal is only possible through some hackish copy-paste which is n't a very good method . We 're still looking for ways to allow Extensions to hook into other modals , though . <p> I just updated the Command Toolbox extension to the new version 1.43.21 . I immediately tested changing one of my commands in the manner you described . While it did save that command as a multi-line command , it also deleted all of my other commands . <p> @jonmcknight ah , sorry about that but thanks for the report . I have temporarily reverted the version found in the Library to 1.4 so that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the fix should be relatively quick . <p> I just updated the Command Toolbox extension to the new version 1.43.22 . I immediately tested changing one of my commands in the manner you described . The bug that was deleting all other other commands is no longer present , however it is no longer saving the command as a multi-line command . <p> @jonmcknight hmm , strange . It 's saving the commands correctly as multiline from both my dev environment and our QA environment . What browser are you using ? What version of SC and what OS for the SC server ? <p> I just got it to work , but I 'm not certain how or what the problem was . <p> After yesterday 's 1.43.21 issue that deleted all but the edited multi-line command , my commands where as follows : <p> 16 as " Default " #7 as the multi-line command that I just saved.810 as " Default " <p> Later that day I edited command #1 to a normal single line command leaving me with the following commands : <p> #1 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multi-line command that I just saved.810 as " Default " <p> I 'm not sure which of the following two actions I just performed fixed the problem . <p> I reset all commands/names to default , then I setup #1 as a custom single line command and #2 as a soon-to-be multi-line command . <p> I then saved my changes . <p> After this I returned to the /HOST page , modified #2 to be multi-line saved the change and refreshed , ( as I have done every time ) . When I rechecked command #2 , I saw that it was multi-lined and that #1 had not been deleted . So it appears that everything is good now . <p> Basic functionality seems to work in that I can save multi-line commands , reload the page &amp; they are still there , still work &amp; no other commands have been messed up . <p> BUT if I then go back to the Extension settings to add a new command , as soon as I save the extension settings all the carriage returns seem to get wiped out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @KBrownConsulting what you describe is exactly why I was n't too happy with how I had to implement this . The ability to save multiline-commands is only possible from the Command Toolbox modal on the Host page because the textarea field . The Edit Extension Settings modal uses an input element of type text which does n't respect the newlines . <p> We 're still looking for a good , clean way to hook into current modals in order to modify their behavior . But , until then , this is about as good as it gets without having to change a significant amount of stuff around or implement a hackish alternative . <p> Would it be possible to update not just the command itself but the name of the command from within the Command Toolbox modal on the Host page ? If so , we could just enable ALL commands from the Extension settings page initially ( with the unused ones having a name/title of " Unused " ) &amp; from then on configure/update/add new commands from the Host page . It 's ugly &amp; hackish but no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less ) solve the problem . <p> Tech X modifies an existing multi-line command that is commonly used by other SC users . Tech X appends/inserts commands that create a new local admin account as well as downloads &amp; installs a remote administration tool of their choosing . If they wanted to try &amp; hide their actions a little they could program in some logic into the commands so they only run against the target server . <p> Tech X waits . <p> Tech A who does have access to the target server runs the modified command on the target server as part of regular maintenance . <p> Tech X now has full admin rights to the target server ... <p> Tech A would almost undoubtedly be unaware of the malicious changes for two reasons : 1 - The purpose of the Command Toolbox extension is to simplify/automate things &amp; you do n't want to have to audit the code before sending it every time . 2 - With the current modal dialog box that pops up on the Host page you ca n't even see the full text of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the text box . <p> As a follow-up thought ... if this is indeed a concern , and one that might cause you to consider reversing the changes ; instead of losing the feature altogether , maybe there could be an option added to the main Extension options controlling whether or not the " Overwrite Setting " functionality is enabled with a link to an explanation of the security considerations . <p> ( That way people like myself who are essentially a 1-man shop &amp; do n't have to worry about this issue can still take advantage of the multi-line capability immediately ! ) <p> Would it be possible to update not just the command itself but the name of the command from within the Command Toolbox modal on the Host page ?

Many of the remote monitoring and management tools have their own remote support built in but there are still requirements for on-demand support for new machines or machines not managed/monitored by the RMM tool but where remote support is needed from time to time . Integration should enable a technician to initiate a session from a ticket within Connectwise UI and if possible feed any session details , notes or chat contents back to the ticket at the end of the session . <p> I agree with Adrian . We are getting ready to implement Connectwise and having a simple integration to be able to launch a session from Connectwise and maybe send an email invite automatically would be incredible . <p> Ok seems pretty popular a sister company of ours also uses Connectwise in conjunction with our ticketing software IssueNet .

I spoke with a member of the ConnectWise team and both NTR and LogMeIn were given time from the ConnectWise development team to hardcode in those buttons you see for them . Those buttons and access are not part of an API at least that was how it was explained to us in our phone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done this years ago . The team at ConnectWise were great to talk with and very helpful but basically the conversation was left that they were very busy and development was more than a year out with scheduled projects . And that our request for similar integration would be noted and if they proceeded they would let us know . My notes show that the only real integration point available at this time is for users to create a link in the links area that would launch our application . But the ability to create sessions from tickets , open existing unattended connections , etc ... were not available through their API today . <p> We get this request probably 1x a week and we would love to do more but its a bit out of our hands at the moment . We encourage users of both products to raise enhancement requests on both sides ( ScreenConnect and ConnectWise ) . I can assure you that we would certainly allocate resources to make this happen as soon as we know we can actively work with the ConnectWise team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for the reply . I was at the ConnectWise Midwest user conference this week and they were talking about the LogMeIn &amp; NTR integrations and it made me think of how much we like ScreenConnect and how great it would be if there was a similar integration set with you . <p> I will definitely reach out to my account manager to raise the request on that side as well . <p> Sounds great , if we can make it happen we would be happy to provide any development resources to bundle up a nice integration . ConnectWise appears like a great tool and very popular among our MSP customers , we would like to do more there and maybe get more involved with their community . If you hear anything you can direct it to this post or to sales@screenconnect.com .... Have a great weekend ! <p> I will certainly check on this to see what we can do . The team at Connectwise has been great to work with to this point , but the majority of their API ( last time I looked ) was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have had was the ability to kick off a session from inside Connectwise or ability to connect to one of the unattended clients , quickly . <p> These areas , were on my last conversation with their team , hard coded so there was n't much we could do . According to the representative a ticket was going to be submitted to allow similar access for ScreenConnect or maybe just exposing some of this via API ( or similar ) so that some of this could be accomplished . I will certainly hop back on Connectwise and take a look to see if the above are now available . I can ask someone to look into it later this week or early next week . <p> - Creating support session from a ticket and inviting guest to that session via chat or email. - Providing 1-2 click join support session for tech- Ability to query and/or assign assets to a customer so that you can launch existing unattended client connection- Push session info ( session name , guest name , tech name , duration , etc ) back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen around Connectwise . Does this summarize what you are looking for as well ? <p> I was just looking on the enhancement forums on ConnectWise and there is very little said and few votes for integration on the ConnectWise enhancement forums . If you want to see ConnectWise to take action on a piece of development , voting for enhancement requests is what gets attention . Please jump on and vote for the **25;6267;TOOLONG integration . I would love to see more votes and action on the ConnectWise side . <p> Yes I agree with scube13 - I was just going to recommend the same - Using the links options could work quite well . Also - 2015.1 has just rolled out a new UI - it may add the button features you wanted . <p> I 'm currently on the trial of ScreenConnect and am blown away . I was looking for an alternative to the crazy expensive , but very solid LogMeIn Rescue and Central ... <p> I am also a ConnectWise and N-central user , so I 'm looking for integration for one or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where billing and ticketing take place . Like jroe mentioned , 2015.1 may provide more options . I 'm going to start playing with links and see what I can come up with . <p> Thank you guys for solid product and very attentive support/development team . I look forward to joining the SC family very soon . <p> Thank you very much for the feedback . We do n't have a lot of contacts on the ConnectWise team at this time , but we are talking more with lots of companies so hopefully we can do more there soon . Please let us know how your testing goes . <p> Joined this forum to say that i am blown away by the simplicity and ease of use that screenconnect has ! great work guys . I am hoping the official integration with Labtech &amp; Connectwise ( i use both ) comes soon ! <p> i heard about this product via the team at desk director . unimpressed by VNC in Labtech , i am looking for an alternative way to control machines , specifically macs . Anyone have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the announcement and am *very* excited about the integration with LabTech as well , as I recently starting using the LT hosted product a month ago . I 've been a ScreenConnect user for a couple years now and have been extremely impressed with the product after using alternatives like Bomgar . <p> Now my two systems will be part of the same family . I do hope this will lead to better things in the future ( though really , how much more awesome could ScreenConnect get ? ? ) . <p> Thanks its keeping us busy right now , but once we get through the next few weeks it should be business as usual and lots of great new functionality and integrations to come .

@@96443719 @643719/ <p> We connect to quite a few computers that are NVRs , so they 're displaying a bunch of camera displays . With ScreenConnect , the speed is usually terrible when we 're connecting like this , even when we set the default quality to lowest.I was originally not going to blame screenconnect , as our internet connections around here are pretty bad , however similar products ( like Teamviewer ) connect and display far quicker for the same computers . <p> So ... is there a tweak or something we can do to get better display &amp; speed when connecting to something displaying video ? <p> Based on what I have seen , SC did some magic in 5.1 to increase the video speed for things like what you are talking about . What version are you on ? <p> However , the sad truth is , this new magic is not perfect either , as now I see the screen redrawing on some connections , where before I never saw this . There are other threads in the forums describing this problem . I have called support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it was fixed in 5.3 . <p> We 're also on version 5.3.9011.5632 .

It did n't look pretty but was responsive and good enough to see what you were doing , even on exceptionally slow DSL lines with 128k upstream bandwidth ... Would be awesome if ScreenConnect could implement something similar <p> The problem is about the screen redraw function that buffers a lot of redraws that screenconnect needs to play instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers which have some eye candy ( windows aero with alpha channel mainly ) over a slow dsl link . <p> An example here , with lowest possible SC quality : Any FX gets as slow as it can be : <p> IMHO the solution would be to detect slow links and discard older screen redraws , thus only using the very last one to update on client side .

Most times we are connecting to servers and we have an opportunity to change the driver to the built-in VGA driver . It needs a reboot , but afterwards things start flying again . I realize this is n't feasible in all circumstances but it might be worth exploring . <p> As deajan noted , I believe the problem mentioned in this thread is not specific to the Matrox cards . We do know already that Matrox drivers do make SC perform poorly in general even when not displaying video . You may also want to consider that turning off the hardware acceleration for the Matrox card has the same effect as changing to the Generic VGA driver . In some cases turning off the acceleration does not need a reboot . It is also safer than changing drivers remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card supports that the generic VGA drivers do not . <p> This is most certainly *NOT* just on Matrox cards . ScreenConnect has been slower than TeamViewer since the day I began trialing it . Not by much , but enough to make it noticeable . I live with it because SC is a better product , and I loathe TeamViewer and their piss poor release and fee schedules . <p> I like to keep my quality on high , but lately have been contemplating switching it to medium , then manually switching after connecting .

Version 4.4.7175.5302 had everything I use and needed , and I have over 40 unattended clients . I wanted to roll back the software but that would entail visiting every client to downgrade their software , which is impossible . Some of my clients are thousands of miles away . A new version was released in October 2015 , I have just shot off a support ticket to see if this video issue has been improved , I do n't want to upgrade again until the video is fixed .

With this integration so many would have no issues using ScreenConnect . <p> MrCartwright , I 'm fairly familiar with ServiceNow but if you have any information on how the Bomgar integration works today or what API capability ServiceNow has please send it over . I will ask one of our team who is working on several integrations right now to add this to his list . <p> Everyone The biggest hurdle for any of these integrations is the soft introduction of the two companies . I often receive basic API documentation that provides no real insight as to how to really go about providing an integration . It usually tells me how to push or pull data but not the best way to setup a button , script , URL , etc . But most of this can generally be worked out in a 15 minute phone call with someone who knows the software well . <p> Just a thought that it may be easier to develop certain action API 's that scale well with services like " If This Then That " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of developing specifically for one app , the apps that are supported by those services can integrate using the hook API 's and then it streamlines the process of getting everything to talk ... <p> We have fairly extensive API actions for these sort of integrations . I can only think of a handful of tools that we have talked with that we could n't use existing API to integrate . It really comes down to working with them to improve the integration path via UI changes , buttons , etc . It generally comes down to customer expectations . We have full capability to connect to remote access machines , create support sessions , send out invites , etc . But the UI elements need to exist on the other application to launch or all these items . We take the lists here and try to reach out to start communications . But we also recommend pushing to your account managers , sales reps , or anyone you know at these companies that you want to see an integration . The more feedback they get the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few resources . My experience is that once a development resource is assigned we can generally knock out these integrations in a day or two . Then there is the testing , QA , etc . <p> This may be way in left field for this thread , but I would love to see FreePBX integration somehow . It was a real challenge getting my company to ditch GoToMeeting since you can do voice in GoToMeeting over PC headset or call in from a phone . Its unrealistic to expect our customers to join a meeting with a PC headset . Our solution for now is to simply create conference rooms in our phone system that we use during the meetings but its not a seamless feel . If there was a way to get the SC voip to integrate with FreePBX conferences that would be awesome ! <p> I seem to be the only one , but i 'd love to be able to click through from SolarWinds Web Help Desk to a ScreenConnect session . WHD does provide a plug in that allows it to pass off an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe a similar thing could be achieved for ScreenConnect ?

We have also experienced some instances where our printers remain installed on the remote system even after the remote session is ended . Whether this is intended or not , I do n't know , but either way , we do n't want it . For us , there needs to be a high degree of separation between the remote computers and our technician computers , for security reasons , since we are a third-party IT support company .

Remote support software should try not to change computer or user settings , unless it is really needed.I also see no reason to invest development efforts in something which is most likely impossible to work reliable between Mac/Windows/Linux cross-platform . <p> Please try first to fix international keyboard mapping and make this cross platform compatible instead of adding ( questionable ) new features . New features are interesting , but it would rather be better to fix bugs which really annoy the users before introducing new bugs . <p> We have seen that the remote printers do n't always remove . Guess who 's fault it is when our client 's ca n't print and all they see is our printer 's there , even it that has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it off and eliminate some unnecessary support calls . <p> It 's causing Virtual XP Integration Features to not load for anyone using a USB printer , which in turn causes virtual XP applications to not load . This is a huge issue for my clients . As much of a useful feature this can be , I wish I would 've stayed on 5.1 . <p> Well , there goes my urge to go 5.2 quickly . It 's great this got added , but it sounds like it needs to be more refined . Admittedly , we rarely need remote printing , but this should really be something that can be enabled before/when connecting to a remote . Also , it should have a UI that let 's us specify which of our local printers get published on the remote . <p> +1from my point of view this should be an " opt-in " feature , ie. disabled by default.I see ScreenConnect as a support tool , not a remote-work tool . In this regard remote printing is more of a pain than a help.RVa . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a feature without the ability to disable said feature . <p> I hate to have to say it , but I agree completely . This feature has not only been an ongoing annoyance for us , it is also a serious security concern . The inclusion of a feature like this without sufficient warning as to the fact that it would be enabled by default and without any ability to disable it was very irresponsible . I am disappointed that this has not been addressed yet . <p> We are certainly watching the responses . I am not sure if we will hold 5.2 , but we are looking to address the concerns raised in the post soon . <p> Understood . <p> We will not be installing 5.2 as-is . We support external customers and any complication or alteration to their environment can lead to non-billable recalls that only damage our reputation . While printing could be occasionally useful , adding and removing printers to the target workstation at each connection without being absolutely necessary represents a risk to the environment . <p> We are certainly watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.2 , but we are looking to address the concerns raised in the post soon . <p> Thanks for being aware and working on it . <p> For the time being , as painful as it will be to re-deploy , I 'm removing all of my access clients until a patch or update is released and am using VNC to limp-by . I 've had a call or email from nearly all ( 70+ ) of them having printing issues from the left-over redirects since I 've updated to 5.2.8609.5546 a few days ago . <p> I realize it 's partially my fault for updating to a pre-release version , but this is severely handicaping my , and my client 's productivity . Hopefully everyone 's " feedback " will assist in development . <p> We are certainly watching the responses . I am not sure if we will hold 5.2 , but we are looking to address the concerns raised in the post soon . <p> Jeff , if addressing the printer redirection issues will take a while maybe you guys can just turn off the feature altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the feature is a convenience when needed but most of us will only use it occasionally . Maybe you can then work on printing more for a 5.3 ( or 5.4 ? ) release and we can enjoy the other benefits from the stable 5.2 goodness sooner . <p> We are certainly watching the responses . I am not sure if we will hold 5.2 , but we are looking to address the concerns raised in the post soon . <p> Jeff , if addressing the printer redirection issues will take a while maybe you guys can just turn off the feature altogether and release the stable 5.2 without ? From what I see the feature is a convenience when needed but most of us will only use it occasionally ........ <p> This exactly.SC are being given clear warning that releasing this feature into the production version is going to cause problems . Either hold back 5.2 to make it an optional feature or remove the feature completely and add it to a later version . <p> I love SC , i 'm so happy ive made the switch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature to add in my opinion . If I make 10 connections a day x 5 days a week x 48 weeks a year , that 's 2400 connections . Ive been doing it for 15 years . Thats 36,000 odd remote connections , not once have I ever thought that ide like to remote print during a support session . Ive been speaking to my guys who have been in the game a similar time , they have never wanted to remote print either ..... <p> Given that basic features like disabling aero for a simple performance boost are missing or cleaner ways of setting security levels for users , i 'm lost as to why remote printing has made it in . <p> Anyway , i 'm still a big fan , but ide be taking the thoughts on those above seriously regarding 5.2. 
@@96443780 @643780/ <p> Here is the scenario:Our client 's server has specialty software for their specific business for which they pay the software vendor for support.This vendor needs to get access to work on the server but does n't have their own remote solution ( what 's up with that ? ? ) . <p> Without having to create user accounts for the vendor , what is the easiest way to get the vendor onto this remote server ( remote to both us and the vendor ) ? <p> Have the customer purchase a logmein pro license and use that . I do n't think SC is there yet as far as this goes . Prior to this I was able to allow my LMI users to create a free login and utilize my LMI accounts that I delegated them administrative permissions to . It is n't your responsibility to provide this functionality for your software vendor . With that said , a free screen connect account tied to our ( your ) delegated pcs would be nice . <p> I do n't  under stand this : " Without having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest way to get the vendor onto this remote server " <p> Where do you do n't  want to create a user account ? <p> In Screenconnect you can tie a Screenconnect to a specific Machine . This user does not neccessarily need an account on the server . Screenconnect will connect him to the console . It this is locked , and he does not have an account then he is unable to do whatever he likes to do . But you could unlock the Console for him using your account on the Server.However , he must have a Screenconnect account on your scrrenconnect server , otherwise he can not access the system . <p> Assuming a Windows Server environment , enable RDP and perhaps firewall it to specific IPs ( I would assume the software vendor would have a static IP or subnet ) . My understanding is that the ScreenConnect license does not allow third party use of your license for remote access . The license covers you and your staff/company only . <p> We are starting to address how we handle other organizations using your software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to help your team or customers . Our concern was around companies selling or giving access away of the software to other organizations . I expect to have some updates to our EULA to permit more openness here for certain license types and use models . <p> Back to this particular issue I believe the request focuses around providing a link or something that provides temp access to a session without going through the setup of user or role in ScreenConnect . This can be especially useful for AD auth situations . It is something I have noted but do n't have today . It would need to be done by setting up a role and user in ScreenConnect . Some companies use generic logins that their partners can use and they move sessions in/out of those folders by editing custom properties or note fields . <p> Just create a meeting session and join the machine with the special software to the meeting session.Use a code if you want to restrict access to only those that know a code.When prompted , give full control to everyone joined to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just when the vendor needs access <p> Than to remote in enter the code on the screen connect guest page and click the arrow to load the remote session <p> +1 for allowing 3rd party access . We use AD for user access control and do n't want any un-needed additional accounts in AD . Would it a possible quick fix be to allow for both LDAP and local database for access control . That way we could create accounts for outside users in ScreenConnect and not have to add things to AD.

This suggests to me that it 's trying to update the db schema and using SQLite specific language rather than the specified db connector 's abstraction , but I could be completely off-base . <p> Yeah , we were using ADD COLUMN to add columns rather than just ADD ; that does n't work for SQL Server , but it looks like SQLite will work with either , so the next version will have that fix . In the meantime , you can add the columns manually if you want to re-upgrade ( EventAttributes int not null for SessionEvent and SessionConnectionEvent ) .

@@96443790 @643790/ <p> I currently have our Screenconnect server with the Web Server using port 80 and the Relay using port 443 . We have many customers with firewalls that ONLY allow those ports . <p> I do n't like the idea of my login name/password passing in the clear coupled with the fact that I want our more security conscious customers to feel comfortable with a **25;7197;TOOLONG protected guest page . I would like to purchase a certificate and bind it to the Web Server while changing the port it listens on to 443 . However , I also need customers/technicians to be able to type in HTTP : //oursupportsite and have screenconnect redirect or rewrite the URL to HTTPS : //oursupportsite . While I have seen at least one post that describes how to do this by Jake , it was under the assumption that the Relay port was NOT using port 80 but instead 8041 . I need to use 80 for the relay ( or even 443 ALSO , if it will work that way . ) It does n't matter so long as its 443 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have also seen a post where someone suggests assigning an additional IP to the screenconnect server 's network interface . I 'd rather not do that either as I 'm 99% sure I 'd have to use ANOTHER precious external static IP to port forward to that additional internal IP , of which I do n't have many left . <p> I 'm not fond of major changes to the default code included with screenconnect because I fear it will be something easily broken with future updates , and will make me gun shy in performing them . I really want to update to take advantage of features in the future . <p> You can run the relay on port 80 and web on 443 . The problem lies when a client hits your web server on port 80 it will not respond . So unless you make sure all clients use https and not http you can just stop here . <p> I have tried this extensively and the only possible method I have found is to have 2 IP 's on the SC server so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for relay and 443 for web are bound to IP2 . <p> bigdessert is absolutely correct in his analysis . You will have to ensure your clients join sessions via ( https : //yoursite.screenconnect . ) . <p> Ok . After asking phone support for the solution to do this I was referred to the ' forum ' as this was ' Advanced Customization ' , which annoyed me . Why ? First of all , this should be the STANDARD way the product should be configured out of the box . More than ever the Internet is a scary place to do business and other users on this forum have also posted that inputing logins and passwords in plaintext across the internet on port 80 is DANGEROUS . Not only that if you use ports 80 + 443 99.9% of firewalls are going to allow that traffic through . For the life of me I ca n't figure out why it 's not like this by default . Heck $40 Linksys , Netgear , Dlink routers come this way out of the box . Anything this day and age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 443 out of the box ! ! Not only that they usually have a built in certificate which negates the need to buy a certificate ( which I do n't mind doing , but still ) . So fine we try to figure it out as consumers of your product on our own . Well because you do n't use IIS , but your own custom code in . Net or whatever it is , you ca n't search out there and find answers away from Screenconnect easily ! So we are stuck with the FAQ and the forum . Second it 's not ' Advanced Customization ' . I 'm not asking to have my logo bounce up and down spin around , have 6 factor authentication , be rewritten in Java , AJAX , or whatever , etc . <p> So after patiently waiting almost a month for an official answer , and having Mike Bannerman email me to tell me that the development team is looking into my post , and paying for my two licenses last week this is the official support response I get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you read bigdessert 's post at all Sean ? He does suggest a way to do it via dual IPs. 2 . I suggested the dual IPs method in my original post . If this is true please explain exactly HOW to do it , and if I will have to use an additional external IP . I mean its not like you can just throw an secondary IP and point your router to screenconnect , there will be code changes , and because it 's not using IIS ...... well see above.3 . A 5 to 10 minute phone call would have been easier to both explain what I want and get a response with followups with support . After which if a solution is offered , support can ADD it to the FAQ rather than say , if you post it on our forum it will be seen by all , which is not the same as forum is only as good as it 's search engine and is a disorganized hodgepod . I love forums , but nothing beats a knowledgebase or FAQ.4 . Email support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call back when ' we(support) are not busy ' would also be acceptable . This is how Digium does it , when they deem a support issue not vital . You can call and if their lines are free they will answer you or they will call you back when they are slow , which can take a while . Fine by me . <p> I think another solution to this issue may be having a subdomain set up with a forwarding html page that takes the user to the ssl secured web portal so the user can type in a quick url and not need to add the https . For example , support.mysite.com takes the user to a page with a meta tag like : <p> It 's not the smoothest solution ever but I think it would do the trick . The web port is 443 .

Try the " **27;7360;TOOLONG " configuration key and have that bind on the primary ip , 80/http <p> With this setup you 'll have an https endpoint for security conscious customers and host access . Port 80 will still be reachable and work as expected BUT it wo n't forward to https . <p> About the rest of the featureset discussed , I do n't think you 'll be able to set up http redirects without setting up a proper http server in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What you can do though is use DNS cnames to have **30;7389;TOOLONG or whatever other domain point to your www.domainname.com . <p> I have n't forgotten to implement this , I just have n't had time . I bought the certificate weeks ago . I 've been on a couple of vacations and we 've gotten busy . I should be able to try it out within the next couple of weeks ... <p> This allows the web server to listen on port 80 so you do n't have to type in HTTPS and 443 for HTTPS . Create a redirect so if a client does n't type in HTTPS , it automatically redirects them . <p> Hope this helps . <p> No it does n't help . Again , ports 80 or 443 ONLY . No other ports .

I 'll see if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I should have been more explicit . Only 1 service can listen on any given port .

I am finding this to be a wholly unacceptable situation . In a nutshell , as good as the application is , the basic architecture needs a serious rethink , or at the very least the ability to deal with host headers . <p> The simple fact is that in this modern age , any firewall that is worthy of business class traffic will lock down just about everything but 80 and 443 . This application should be more than capable of using those two ports for secure login and relay , PERIOD . Anything less and it useless for about 80% of my remote support scenarios . <p> While some of us may have the ability to use two public IPs , some of us do not . I am currently hosting SC on Azure . I do not have the ability to bind two public IPs.Why can this application simply not use host headers to differentiate between web traffic and relay traffic . <p> http and https support.mydomain.com for guest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrypted ) <p> AND NO ... I do not want to mess around with IIS and piggybacking , etc . The SC webserver should simply have the ability to deal with host headers . Come on SC , how about a little love on this ? <p> This should not really be that hard to implement and is far more important than half of the bells and whistles that are being developed . <p> Ok here 's how to do it . Works with version 3.3 . XXXX through the latest 3.4.4855.4932 . <p> You 'll need 2 external IP 's and 2 internal IP 's , Microsoft IIS , and a free Microsoft module for IIS . Both screenconnect web service and relay service will use port 443 . <p> Assuming you have a DNS record for your screenconnect domain ( Web service ) create another DNS record , a subdomain ( relay service ) , under the same domain . For example if your url is domainname.com then relay.domainname.com . <p> I will use the following examples throughout this post so it 's easy to follow:External IP 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks especially to bblankenship78 , the Screenconnect staff , and others who contributed to this thread . <p> Along with this configuration - we had to make a few changes for our environment ( ScreenConnect 4.1.6060.5144 , Windows Server 2012 , IIS 7.0 ) <p> 2 issues were found with the above configuration <p> 1 . ScreenConnect Relay service would not start using the External IP ( e.g. 1.1.1.2 ) for Relay service in the " RelayListenUri " variable.2 . ScreenConnect Web Server service would bind to the first , local IP interface when specifying the domain name in the " WebServerListenUri " variable . <p> If you run the following command , it will list your iplisten IP addresses . Just verify the correct IPs are listed : <p> Code : <p> netsh http show iplisten <p> After doing all of this , I just restarted the Windows server to make sure services starting normally would give us a functional setup . <p> Once rebooted , I was able to go to http : //domainname.com and it redirected to https : //domainname.com , and upon creating a session , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( whether internal or external to our LAN network where the ScreenConnect server is hosted ) <p> Setting up everything with 2 external IPs is cumbersome , but more importantly it can be quite expensive or unfeasible to even get more than one external IP in certain scenarios . <p> There really needs to be some built-in way of having encrypted web traffic without losing the ability to respond on port 80 ( Ca n't the relay service listen for a web request in addition to handling the session data and forward those requests to port 443 ? ) <p> Short of that , it seems to me that by far the easiest workaround presently would be a variant of what DrM posted by using an alternative domain or subdomain as the " front " for web traffic and have that forward to the the " real " domain . If you have a DNS service that supports forward records it can be handled entirely with DNS ( no separate websites needed for the forwarding ) . <p> I 'd completely forgotten about this and ran into my first instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily extra internal and external IP addresses are n't a problem for me .. but can someone explain why the IIS module / re-direct is necessary ( I 'm probably missing something really straight-forward , definitely lack of coffee today ) or is it only necessary if you literally want another subdomain/domain redirect ? <p> If you have two internal IP addresses and two external IP addresses and configure the bindings properly ( to let 's say support.domainname.com and relay.domainname.com and separate IP addresses internally ) , I thought SC could re-direct port 80 to 443 itself via LONG ... for the web server side ? <p> +1 for having all of this handled internally by SC / host headers tho .. would make a lot of sense although i 'm guessing there 'd be backwards-compatibility issues . Would likely need extra bindings / ports to handle the older clients that do n't support it ? <p> Sorry for the book , guys . I wanted to clear up some misunderstandings here and answer some questions . <p> I 'm afraid some of you are misunderstanding the nature of SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a port that normally uses SSL ( such as 443 ) . Quite the opposite , the service must be capable of using SSL from the ground up , and unless it 's imposed at that level it will not be enforced regardless of the port in use . <p> The specific position for using 80 and 443 is to ensure maximum firewall and environment compatibility , as some hardened networks will not allow certain traffic on other ports . That 's only a consideration at all because ScreenConnection requires two ports to function . <p> ScreenConnect requires these two ports for differing purposes/services : one for the web interface and one for the relay service . Both can use the same port , but if they 'll be on the same port they must be on different IP addresses . <p> OR you can use the same IP and use different ports . <p> In any case , you are NOT required to use 443 for SSL ! If you 're concerned about firewall impositions , consider using a different common SSL port for bypassing that . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common email services . As long as you do n't require those ports for email on your IP you can use them and bypass most firewalls that way . You can also opt to use ports that are not normally SSL but impose SSL by adding the " s " to https in the SC configuration value for WebServerListenUri . As long as you 're defining the https protocol there , regardless of port , it 'll use SSL . There are a dozen ports that are allowed by most firewalls , but the 5 above are the most common . Surely if you 're stuck in an environment where it 's that big of a deal , you can configure them to work for you . Https will remove the port number from the URL if the port is 443 , but only because that 's considered the " standard " port for encrypted http traffic . Just as using standard http will hide the " : 80 " from the browser -- it 's redundant . You *can* use port 80 for SSL as long as you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a la , httpS : //example.com:80/ <p> There 's a GREAT utility I use all the time from Digicert to test SSL certificates on various LONG ... the host name and port number , such as : **35;7448;TOOLONG quickly see whether it 's really using SSL ( or even capable ) and if it 's configured correctly . <p> It is NOT possible to " just use host headers " to differentiate between which service is functioning on a port , as only a single service can have access to a given port on a single IP . Host headers are great at doing what they do -- differentiating between different destinations within a single top-down service ( such as Apache or IIS ) , but since two different services can not simultaneously access the same port on the same IP , the relay and web interface must be split up either by ports or IP 's . <p> Furthermore , I 'm not seeing anything to indicate that ScreenConnect is capable of using SSL for the relay . Sure , you can put the relay service on 443 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know that I 'd personally want it to due to the overhead , but it 's important to understand that putting it on 443 for the sake of imposing SSL will not work . Please , someone from SC , correct me if I 'm wrong and there 's some form of internal parsing for 443 that is n't otherwise exposed in the settings - ' cause I do not see anything there to suggest relay would actually be secured on 443 . For that matter , I do n't see anything to suggest that , outside of potential hardened firewall issues , putting the relay on any port other than 8041 is going to help in any way whatsoever . And updating the clients to use the new relay service port would be a PITA . <p> Finally -- thank you to everyone who contributed to this topic . It 's going to help me configure SC how I want it when I have the time to juggle the options &amp; settings in my environment . When I 'm done I 'll share my configuration so others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to clear up some misunderstandings here and answer some questions . <p> I 'm not sure exactly what you are responding to . Nobody is talking about needing SSL for the relay , as ScreenConnect already encrypts the relay traffic anyway . The issue is simply about ports that are typically open on *CLIENT* side networks ( in other words , configurations that you ca n't change ) . Many people have noted that there are some networks that are ultra-locked down and ONLY allow traffic through the standard HTTP/HTTPS ports ( 80/443 ) . <p> There is no problem with running the relay service on port 80 without SSL ( because the data is already encrypted ) and using port 443 with SSL for the web interface in terms of ScreenConnect operation . <p> The problem is simply that in this configuration the client has to manually enter " https " in their browser as the relay service on port 80 wo n't respond to web requests . The workaround with two public facing IP addresses is OK for those that already have an " extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't see the actual ScreenConnect code , but it would seem to me that it would be at least possible for the relay service to listen for very specific HTTP requests and respond with a 301 redirect . Note that I 'm not talking about running a full HTTP server on the port , but that the relay service would be able to identify specific HTTP requests ( at an IP packet level ) that are currently just dropped and instead send a simple 301 redirect in response . <p> #14 did . Others ( #30 , for example ) seems to think that some magical use of host headers can somehow fix a problem that 's imposed by service-level differences . <p> The " fix the default configuration " complaints are the one 's that really needed to understand that this is n't something that can be safely changed in the setup . Routers that have their own SSL certificates , for example , are a poor example of native SSL , since they do n't need to be responding to our own domain names . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central cert is fine . But when it needs to have a unique URL for each SC install , it wo n't work . SC imposing itself on ports 80 and 443 would break our existing web servers and changing ports after we have clients installed will result in losing their connections . <p> #14 did .

Bottom line what people want is the ability to have SSL encrypted web connections and still be able to have the relay service work using only ports 80 and 443 , while still allowing a client to initially visit the site using HTTP or HTTPS . <p> All your talk of certificates , routers , and " SC imposing itself on ports " does n't even make sense . Certificates and SSL configuration are not even remotely what this thread is about ( except that we need SSL to encrypt web sessions ) . The reason SC needs to have the option of working over only ports 80 and 443 is because , as stated many times before , there are A LOT of networks out there that block anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details a possible solution by having the relay service ( on port 80 ) operate its own crude HTTP listener at a packet level only for the purpose of redirecting clients to the HTTPS site ( port 443 ) , but this would have to be implemented by the SC developers directly . <p> Maybe I 'm not understanding your posts at a fundamental level , but what exactly are you trying to add to the discussion ?

Maybe if you had actually read what other people actually wrote you would n't be wasting my time by debating the finer points of what THEY were requesting and complaining about . <p> Let 's keep this civil please . I read the entire thread long before your first post ( and in fact posted in this very thread 26 days ago ) , and I 'm simply asking you to explain what you mean in better detail . <p> First , there is no specific technical reason why the " default " configuration ca n't be to have secure communication for both web and data sessions . It is simply a matter of programming effort on the part of the SC developers using some type of solution like what I proposed ( or something else ) . Other remoting software systems can do it ( whether they are of similar design or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with a user of ScreenConnect expecting that web traffic would be encrypted in a default configuration . Unencrypted traffic is VERY dangerous today , and I ca n't imagine much worse than someone gaining access to an admin 's SC login with a bunch of unattended sessions . Trying to defend the lack of " default " support by talking about a bunch of technical limitations is not very helpful . Sure , there may be limitations currently and some people wo n't understand how things are setup , but the status quo is not really acceptable IMO if it means unencrypted logins out of the box , so that is not an excuse forever . Workarounds are fine as well , but are pretty obtuse or require complicated setups . Bottom line , if LogMeIn can have no-nonsense encrypted web and data there is no reason SC developers ca n't figure out a way ( even if it means changing how certain things are structured ) . I 'm not saying that they have to do it exactly like LogMeIn or that it will be easy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what this thread is primarily about--that is , asking the SC developers to make it work . <p> Also , the only point that was mentioned about routers was that they are typically set up to require SSL sessions even for LAN use . It was just a reference to the fact that even local router traffic is usually encrypted these days because of the danger of sniffing data in unencrypted communication . SC on the other hand is being used over the internet for most people so the danger is all that more real for snooping unencrypted data . The type of certificate a router uses versus what would be required for a service like SC truly is immaterial to the discussion . The point was simply that even routers use SSL to encrypt traffic these days , so why is n't SC doing that out of the box ? Sure it might be " hard " to get it working that way , but that does n't mean it 's any less important . <p> Finally , I still do n't think you understand why many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is simply for getting through firewalls , period . Using any other ports increase the chance that a client wo n't be able to access SC ( and also makes for potential headaches trying to get non-technical users to add a " : &lt;port&gt; " on the end of a URL . It has been stated and recognized in the thread already that the relay service already encrypts its own data using methods other than SSL ( which is why it is perfectly fine to use port 80 for the relay service ) . The only " problem " with that scenario is the lack of support for HTTP web requests on port 80 , and that is specifically what the workarounds are addressing . What we want is for ScreenConnect to create a solution that will solve that problem " out of the box " . And that is , again , what this thread is really about . <p> Many thanks to the contributors on this post . I finally had success using 2 public and 2 private IPs . The only twist is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get ScreenConnect 's web service to answer on port 443 . Finally figured out that IIS was binding to 0.0.0.0:443 <p> In closing let me add that I too feel that it should n't be this difficult to implement encryption on the web interface . Security should be top priority in all facets of this product , not just the relay service . <p> Now to figure out how to expire the web session after so many minutes . Another security hole in my opinion . <p> If you run the following command , it will list your iplisten IP addresses . Just verify the correct IPs are listed : <p> Code : <p> netsh http show iplisten <p> After doing all of this , I just restarted the Windows server to make sure services starting normally would give us a functional setup . <p> Once rebooted , I was able to go to http : //domainname.com and it redirected to https : //domainname.com , and upon creating a session , I was able to connect as both host and guest ( whether internal or external to our LAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just in case anyone ends up doing this on a Server 2012 R2 box ( which works fine by the way ) but also needs to use the Server Manager ( which I needed for control over Storage Spaces etc ) when browsing to ' File and Storage Services ' in the Server Manager you 'll likely encounter error messages like " Error occurred during enumeration of SMB shares " and you 'll be told to make sure the WinRM service is running ( and it already is ) or to run " winrm quickconfig " which will result in an " Error number : -2144108526 0x80338012 " <p> Make sure you add .. <p> Code : <p> netsh http add iplisten 127.0.0.1 <p> .. too , otherwise the Server Manager can not communicate with WinRM . <p> Posting here because I 've got nowhere to blog and I figure anyone else that comes across this problem might stumble across this in a Google search and save themselves an hour or two if they 're lucky .

The one problem with that is only Relay has any knowledge of the toolbox , so a lot of stuff would have to be refactored for that to happen . <p> Command line access is the no 1 feature I 've been hoping for ( 2nd is file transfer in its own session ) <p> I would eventually prefer option 2 or 3 , but in the short term it sounds like option 1 is already baked into the plans for version 4.0 . Are options 1 and ( 2/3 ) mutually exclusive ? If not , I 'd like to see option 1 , as you said in the web UI and then an option to launch a full command line session ( as in option 2 or 3 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mostly want the option to send single commands like UninstallStrings for when my residentials have done something wrong . If I can send some kind of " download and run " command , too , that 'd be fantastic . <p> Visually , I 've always thought it would be an equivalent of having *their* CMD box in front of me . I do n't want anything visual on their end because some of my customers might panic when a box pops up out of nowhere . <p> This is pretty much the only item holding us back from purchasing . We are evaluating different remote solutions but have to have command line access . We have to have the ability to run the unattended clients on CentOS ( Linux ) that are headless ( no GUI desktop ) . When running the commands we need a terminal window so we can see the previous input , error messages , history , etc ... <p> I hope this makes it into the product as it is one of the primary items / features that the " other guys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could merely proxy the connections so that existing tools such as Putty and WinSCP could be invoked the problem would be solved and would give people the option to use whatever xyz ... terminal client they prefer . <p> IIRC I was the first person to ask for this feature . It 's nice to see it being implemented.For me , Option 1 will suffice . My command line skills are better than my point and clickity click clickclick click clickclickclickclick anyhow and I can easily build a batch or shell script using those commands.Ultimately though , I 'd love you see full emulation of the console.But beggers and choosers and all that . <p> It would be awesome if screenconnect could establish a tunnel through which context aware powershell commands and scripts could run . <p> I like this idea . I use powershell more than the normal CMD prompt . BUT if you are in the command prompt you can type " powershell " and it will start powershell in the same CMD window . Would the current option that 's being looked at for 4.0 be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition . I think you need both a ' send command to computer ' and a full terminal to really flush out the feature . I 'm guessing that *most* but of course not all the need for this would be for one-liners and feed back . I 'd include the option to upload/transfer/run a script of the the agent 's choosing . Also ' send a command ' can easily scale to send to multiple clients . It 's a great way to fix an entire set of computers . <p> However it would be FANTASTIC to have shell access to gui-less computers linux/pc . It seems that rendering a console may come with it 's own set of issues , but would likely be easier to implement . Please make sure the feature works with gui-less boxes though . It seems like many folks would likely find that very useful . <p> I think option 3 ? I currently have access like this through bomgar - where a persistent command prompt is launched as needed and the benefits are huge . Sometimes I can connect this way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run applications that appear to the user , I can perform malware removal launching apps that wo n't launch through the windows gui , I can perform file operations in the background , killing tasks and the like . <p> I 'd prefer the choice between a quick but then a more thorough one that you can access command line as it would be great for linux to be able to access command line features and also know which directory you are at .

I run six 23 " monitors on my primary machine with a 150% zoom in Chrome and dedicate two displays to SC . I maximize only when I 'm running serial commands in the command tool .

@@96443820 @643820/ <p> The installation process as such is already rather strange , happening by starting Terminal and doing stuff there . But now there is no application in Applications , and there is also no manual or help file . <p> Thanks . Finished the setup and tried to create a first session ( to control my MacBook from my iMac ) . Now my computer wants to download a file " Elsinore ... jnlp " and I - of course , since there is no manual - do n't know what this is all about . <p> I get the feeling that ScreenConnect is in no way a true alternative to TeamViewer ( download it , double-click it , use it ) . It 's more something for Unix-savvy power users . <p> How can I uninstall ScreenConnect and all its related files - also the hidden files and also the Mono files - from my Mac ? <p> Sorry you had problems , there are a few big differences between us and TeamViewer , I will try to touch on those below . But I would also like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about how ScreenConnect works to contact our sales team ( sales@screenconnect.com ) we would be happy to provide a demonstration or help you kick off your first session and test ScreenConnect . <p> 1 . ScreenConnect ( what you download from our site ) is a self-host web application . This is the piece of software that manages the users , connections , security , etc . Many of the popular solutions TeamViewer , LogMeIn , and GoTo all host this central web application for you . You download a client that connects you to their central tool to handle the connections between you and your guest . We are giving you that piece of the puzzle so that you can host it on your own computer/server/VM/VPS . That way all data flows through your environment as opposed to ours and you have control over the branding , access , etc . <p> 2 . Once installed the central web application can be accessed by entering a URL into your browser . Lots of different URLs will work such as LocalHost:8040 , Internal IP Address:8040 , Computer Name:8040 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work inside your network only the external IP address would work with external customers , because that path is externally recognizable outside your network . Its similar to any website so you can also setup a DNS name that resolves to that external IP address such as support.mycompany.com for example . But for testing purposes the external IP will work fine . <p> 3 . In reference to the question about the creating a session and a file downloaded to your system . This is how our software is designed , we do n't require the technician or client to have client files that they maintain on their machines . Nor does ScreenConnect need to be installed on more than 1 machine . Once the central web application is installed , you and or your team access the web application via URL ( mentioned above ) . The web application looks at your browser and OS to determine the best client to install . We have both . NET and Java clients and numerous deployment methods including ( ClickOnce , JRE , downloadable . exe , and the downloadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran you are now connected to the session and this is the same method for customers . After the session is over the clients are removed so that we do n't leave a footprint on either computer . <p> A few notes regarding questions : <p> A ) The ability to host our central web application on anything but Windows was released in our 2.5 release in September 2012 . At this time the functionality to install on a Mac or Linux is pretty new for us and while there were challenges working with Mono all the wrinkles seem to be working themselves out . <p> B ) For anyone looking for documentation or manuals , we keep a list of knowledge articles on everything from joining sessions , creating sessions , how our unattended clients work ( these are persistent clients unlike our standard remote support clients , and much more : ScreenConnect Knowledge Articles <p> C ) Our Getting Started Guide has a video that walks through installing our software and creating your first session . <p> Comparison with other tools <p> We are a bit different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central web application in their environment and that we do n't require a client file be installed for each technician to use for accessing the web application . Many customers download ScreenConnect and at first glance believe they need to install the application on every user 's machine . But as explained above the central web application should instead be installed on a machine central to the entire team and then the proper URL for connecting distributed to the team and potentially bookmarked in their browser of choice . <p> Also we are happy to take feedback or suggestions on documentation that anyone feels would have helped them get ScreenConnect up and going . But ideally we would prefer to make the software more intuitive so that the setup and use model are more clear without needing a ton of documentation . If you have feedback on how we could improve please shoot an email to sales and we will have one of our team analyze the request and see what we can do .

Plus a slew of other problems . It 's sad to see a company like SC go this route and ignore it client base : ( <p> You should contact support for those issues . We are n't aware of any issues like that . <p> I did the research to change from more than 3 simultaneous option of remote control pc in our Company and simplify those with a unique option : SC . <p> I felt in love with SC , and pushed my Company to take the decision to change to SC . <p> Now , this . <p> They should pay SPECIAL attention to this point : there is not LOYALTY on the market nowadays , since company move to any direction trying to be afloat . <p> Screen Connect got craving loyalty with their customers , I was excited to even participate in this Forum as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , interested to push SC far atop of any competition for its fair price , and BE A LEADER to FORCE THE MARKET to a realistic and fair price as well . <p> I was telling everybody about SC . I did my own Wiki within the Company so everybody would love it as well . <p> I was promoting SC to all know IT nearby me . I even get closer to buy for myself and never look back for another software again . <p> I can understand one small company LET be eaten for a big one in order to get profit , because I know everything is BUSINESS . <p> I can understand bigger Company will adjust price , since SUPPORT is not free , they have to pay their resources ( means support staff , chat , whatever ) . <p> But loosing the main reason as everybody exposed here on this post , and they loose LOYALTY of their customers , period . <p> They might be pointing now to big customers instead , they might not care about small ones , like 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to say I have n't had ANY major issues ( that were n't taken care of almost immediately ) . We 've been using SC for 2 years ? since 3.5 I think it was . Love the changes each update made . Full customization which really gets our brand out there . Easy for the customer to get us remote in if there was n't a host installed Fast connection speeds I can keep going . So I ca n't and wo n't bash the product itself . <p> However is it worth this major price hike ? I 'm sorry guys . Dumb move for new customers . Business 101 you do n't jack the price to this extreme right away . Smart way would of been small hike each year . Would people be upset sure but it would n't be such a gut punch . Oh and what 's with all the plan options ? LONG ... . Why not just keep it simple 1 user this princ 2 this and so on . Oh right like how it was . <p> Now we as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky we got locked into the old pricing I just hope we still get updates with our current pricing is all . I know they stated " legacy " will still be supported but I know really know what that means . Not to may companies allow you to keep the old pricing . <p> Just do n't pull a Verizon . Started off no more unlimited data to new customers , than grandfather customers lost this data plan if they upgraded the phone ( unless you bought the phone outright ) . Now they upped the price to 49 ( from 29 ) get people off it . I still have my unlimited data with them but it was n't easy and I feel trapped . Not a good feeling . Connectwise do n't do this crap , do n't follow the herd . <p> Remember there is plenty of other remote tools . So you think big company 's are n't loyal try us small guys you push us around enough we will walk and walk quickly . <p> Just noticed this . I originally purchased screenconnect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Self Hosted2 ) LogMeIn price increases <p> While the new owners are free to position and price the product however they like , I 'm wondering if they gave this product a thorough testing before purchase and price hike . These prices are ridiculous for a product that requires a lot of hair pulling for on-demand sessions . Unattended sessions work well enough , usually , but on demand sessions are completely hit-and-miss . If the user requiring on-demand support is n't computer savvy , it 's 50/50 that you 're in for a rough ride . As other posters have said , the remote party all to often asks " Ca n't we just use teamviewer ? " after struggling with getting a screenconnect session to launch . <p> I assume now that all of this money will start pouring in we can all expect to see some progress on these years-old outstanding bugs , and perhaps even some work done on the mobile front . As is , sessions are often just black screens when connecting from my iPhone 6s Plus , and the web interface to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advancements teamviewer , logmein , and gotoassist have made on their mobile apps in the years since screenconnects mobile interface has been put on the back burner . <p> Small business here . In fact , just a one man show . Stumbled upon Screen Connect after years of trying to find a remote software that would n't break the bank and bankrupt my business and that worked decently . Like some we used Logmein free until they cut that off and we were forced to look for alternatives . As soon as I saw Screen Connect I was sold . This was over 2 years ago . $325 for 1 year and then a great renewal cost , I host my own SC server so there is no middle man snooping through my stuff which puts customers at ease and which means no monthly costs because SC does n't host . This was perfect for us little guys . Now what 's happening ... I can tell the company is going away from the little guys and towards big companies . Even though I am a legacy member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because of the price increases I can no longer recommend SC to my other small business 's or one man shops because the prices are too high . I might as well look into Logmein or Teamviewer as comparable prices . I supported SC and paid the $325 and then the lower renewal cost knowing screen connect was no where near as polished as Teamviewer or Logmein , but I was okay with that . I pay a very reasonable cost and I would have to constantly report bugs and await improvements and fixes . Now , SC is asking for a lot more money for the same product . The same product meaning there are still a lot of bugs for SC to work out and should n't be asking for more money if their problems are n't fixed . Ex . ( Waking a computer does n't work . Same network , computer has everything turned on to wake and it does n't work . However I can download a simple magic packet broadcaster and my computer wakes just fine . As well as getting blank screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but shrug off because its not that important , the problem sometimes happens and shoot I am only paying $325 so I can live with it . VS , If I have to pay the new pricing and I experience these problems , I expect every day these problems occur and are not fixed I am reimbursed for that day because that would be unacceptable . So if you guys at Screen Connect believe your product is 100% working with no problems then you guys should be asking for more money . But your product is buggy , lacking several features that your competitors have and that are now within the same ball park cost . So this is a bad move . A very bad move and I do n't support it . <p> I purchased SC for these reasons ... <p> 1 . Self Hosting ( This is extremely important . ( I do n't want middle man servers logging data and snooping around . Only way to guarantee that is to self host ) 2 . Extremely helpful and friendly people at SC . ( Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same 5-10 people and I knew their names and they would remember me . Now It feels like a new person every time and I do n't get the same feeling of support I did before. ) 3 . Price was extremely fair . <p> I can say one thing though . If self hosting goes away for us legacy members and/or price goes up ( past a certain comfortable point ) I 'm out to find another company and you 'll lose my business and referrals . Maybe that 's what you want , is to widdle away the one man shows and the legacy members .

We 're using the same codebase the new customer pricing model is using ( there is n't a separate " legacy " download ) .

I 've checked mine a couple times and my legacy pricing is still available , but I 've also been diligent about keeping my license current .

Just that it looks like to have been mistakenly put in the their database as the 2,500.00 pricing .

I actually found out a little before the announcement just by trying to upgrade and going " umm wtf " . <p> I do n't think it would be too hard to then flag the old licenses to the new pricing model when you went to upgrade them on the web site . Throwing in " switches " or disabling code would result in lawsuits . The EULA would not defend them at all but in fact sink them in court . So I do n't think they would do this . You would just be " stuck " at a certain version ( if you did n't pay the new licensing fees ) at some point in the future . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 5.5 version because I had been having problems with Windows 10 TH2 bug where clients would not reconnect after the Windows 10 upgrade and even after re-install I am having issues with clients not connecting after reboot . After seeing that it appears this company is trying to pull a Verizon on its loyal customers , think I am out . Why upgrade when it 's obvious in the near future you will lose your grandfathered in rates and be as screwed as new comers . Do n't build out all your remote connections only to have to redo them later when you have even more . Wise people know when to jump ship . ; ) I will start shopping again . I have over 200 unattended sessions which under their new pricing is ridiculous .. might as well drive there . I still remember when ScreenConnect was bought and I received the email saying " do n't worry , nothing is going to change " . I knew right then I was screwed . Charging those prices when we still have to host the server .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , in my experience , usually things go to hell . ScreenConnect sold us out to the highest bidder and then patted us on the shoulder and said " do n't worry , you 'll be fine " lol ; ) <p> P.S. <p> Your software is n't even working right with Windows 10 TH2 and you think this is a good time to increase new customer prices and lose the confidence of your old customers ? <p> I wonder how many of the legacy users who are paying any attention to this forum have posted in this thread . It 's one of the largest threads in this forum and I think it pretty much universally unfavorable . Not that I think it will lead to any change in the pricing model . At best it seems to me it could delay the day when we 're forced into the new pricing model . But even that seems unlikely . I really do n't think Connectwise has any interest in reversing course on the pricing . I think they 've thrown the little guys like me and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to get ( legacy pricing for an undefined timeframe ) . I think all that would make them change the new pricing model is if the market does n't think the software 's worth the price compared to the competition . Which is something I think most people would conclude . I know I would have discounted it almost immediately at that price when I was making my purchase decision about a year ago .

We have 50 technicians and 10 concurrent sessions which suffices . Remote Support is not really our primary business however all Technicians need access to this . <p> Had we done this with your new pricing model , self-hosted with similar features would have cost us a total of $39,560 or $29,400 per year which prices you well out of our market , I genuinely believe moving from the purely concurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remote from Mac to PC , or PC to Mac the client is the same .

SimpleHelp also provides support for VNC , RDP , port forwarding , remote console , machine monitoring , remote Windows registry , etc. etc. - it packs an incredible number of features . <p> We 've been using Screenconnect for the time being ( have n't renewed subscriptions - just going by on what we currently have ) . I was considering switching to Teamviewer until they 've gone the same direction . Will take a little while before I commit , but I might check out SimpleHelp again and see how it goes . <p> I think Screenconnect really missed a golden opportunity . Many disgruntled customers on Teamviewer at the moment looking for alternatives as well now . If SC had have kept their original plans and policies available to everyone as well as the new hosted features , I could imagine that they would have had a huge influx of users jumping from Teamviewer . <p> Will be interesting to see if Simple Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be comparable to what SC used to be ... <p> Putting aside the fact that the latest release is garbage . Crashes Ubuntu 14.02 which we have used as a host for years . The move to default downloads going to a " Temp " folder where most utilities wo n't run . The ridiculous installation of remote printers by default ( no fixed ) which pissed of my clients when 14 printers got added to each of their machines . The pricing model is actually not bad for all but 1 user shops with single session capability . I have three techs plus an occasional subcontractor . I have a 5 session license and candidly it 's not enough even for me alone . I have an 11 monitor workstation and routinely do maintenance on 8 machines or more simultaneously . The 3 user 10 session per would actually fit me better allowing for up to 30 simultaneous sessions for $2195 instead of $7500 on the old plan .

As a professional I like having multiple tools at my disposal and not base my business on any one provider . <p> If you have a ScreenConnect license , you can get a renewal based on the old price . <p> I did purchase SimpleHelp , but I also renewed my ScreenConnect license . Neither is exactly like GoToAssist , but each has its own unique features . I 've canceled my GoToAssist subscription and will make do with the two tools I have . <p> I think that if they keep legacy customers at the same pricing , I will be fine with that . I have been using the product for almost 3 years and I love it . It does suck for people who are just now joining the software and I do believe the on premises software should be cheaper than what it is , but as long as MY pricing does n't change , I have no complaints . <p> As soon as their cloud option came out I feared self hosted customers were going to become second class citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a way to deter self hosted purchases . <p> I use to recommend SC to anyone looking for remote support software . At these new prices I ca n't say the software is worth it anymore , I always felt Bomgar and teamviewer were more polished products , but SC won on price . <p> I have the Unlimited License . To get the same amount of seats I have now it would cost me over $20,000 . I paid 1/5th that price . At the current price I would have NEVER even considered SC . <p> I 'll pay my renewal each year so long as legacy pricing is in place , and SC does n't abandon us self hosted . But I think this was a huge mistake . The old self hosted pricing gave Screen Connect a niche in the market that they have now abandoned . <p> I have had a few support issues , that SC has been very responsive to . I started out several years ago with a two session license for $650 and eventually upgraded to a 5 session license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enjoyed many of the new features that allow us to be more productive . <p> Now as far as the new licensing goes , you are in the technology industry , change is constant . Autocad--no longer sold--subscription only . 3 year license $5000 . Adobe moving that way , Microsoft moving that way . <p> If you are in the IT business and it does not merit $2195 for 3 concurrent users up to 30 sessions and you 've been doing it for years--you are in the wrong business . If your just starting out go subscription and build your business till self hosted makes sense . <p> Let 's examine a 10 year cost . $2195 + $660 per year for 9 years = $8135 or $67.80 a month-- assuming a 20 day work month $3.40 a day for up to 3 users and 30 sessions . <p> I run an 11 monitor station and frequently max out my old license . I an trading it in for the new program as it is much cheaper on per session basis . I have 3 employees and SC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower overall support costs tremendously . <p> Screenconnect , even under the new licensing , is still one of the cheapest tools I use . It literally costs me less than $1 a day per technician . <p> So far I have had zero issues about the quality of support screen connect has . I just think the price hike is a mistake . I was using gotoassist prior and it met my needs but I was paying $64/user/month . In your ten year breakdown screen connect is more expensive ! I would have never switched . <p> When I first purchased screenconnect , it was for 2 concurrent sessions ( no login limits ) . The software cost me $600 , with the expectation of an annual renewal cost of $120 . Using your ten year math , $600 + $120 for 9 years = $1680 total ten year expense compared to a minimum $8000 now . That 's a big difference . <p> I guess I 'm lucky I updated to the unlimited license when we did . I now have 20+ users with no session restrictions , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $11,200 , under the new model my cost would be closer to $2195+ ( 17 tech addon X $795 ) + $3142 per year for 9 years = $43,988 <p> I 'm paying 1/4 the current price and have none of the session restrictions ! <p> I find it a shame that the price in crease has come , I was uming and ahring about getting a license to help the family out and a few other bits and pieces . I can probabaly setup VNC but thought htis would be a good way of going at it .. However this has now put it well outside my price range . Maybe Ill setup a VN proxy for now .. <p> real shame this looked a promising product I was even going to move away from Teamviewer in the office to screen connect but know I will stay where I am teamviewer actually works out cheaper for me i think this is a big mistake ... <p> I 've had screenconnect for about two years now and it has been a great solution . Before I choose screenconnect I had compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple help . screenconnect has been an excellent experience , both the software and the support . Not perfect of course . <p> But I would never have bought it under the new pricing scheme . And , where I have been recommending sc to different companies , I ca n't really do that any longer . Under the current scheme is has moved out of the zone where a firm could engage the product for casual use . <p> SimpleHelp is n't perfect , but its pricing is very similar to the old ScreenConnect pricing .

If you 're unhappy with SC , you 're free to take your business elsewhere but to try to lure clients away from them is pretty shady . Only thing missing in there in an affiliate link . <p> It 's been a while now since the massive price hike for self-hosted users . Is there still no plan to force legacy users into the new pricing ? <p> Did n't they say they 'd re-evaluate the position each January ? Pretty sure they did : I have a note in my diary to renew in December . <p> I have a $600 two-session self-hosted legacy licence ( originally 2x $300 ) and at 80% discount at the end of year 1 it was $120pa to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it still pro-ratas the discount correctly - but more importantly - from the $600 price , not the $2000+ price . <p> We have 50 technicians and 10 concurrent sessions which suffices . Remote Support is not really our primary business however all Technicians need access to this . <p> Had we done this with your new pricing model , self-hosted with similar features would have cost us a total of $39,560 or $29,400 per year which prices you well out of our market , I genuinely believe moving from the purely concurrent licensing to per-technician licensing may be a huge mistake . <p> We are in nearly the same boat . 25 technicians , around 15 concurrent sessions , &gt;3000 unattended sessions . We are lucky to have a legacy self-hosted license but the new self-hosted pricing ( when it does begin to affect us ) is so far out of our price range that it is guaranteed we will leave SC the moment we are forced out of legacy pricing . I understand the push to get people on SC cloud but even giant companies like Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud pricing that allows for them to still meet their cloud adoption goals . Connectwise does n't yet appear to get that concept .

" after struggling with getting a screenconnect session to launch . <p> I assume now that all of this money will start pouring in we can all expect to see some progress on these years-old outstanding bugs , and perhaps even some work done on the mobile front . As is , sessions are often just black screens when connecting from my iPhone 6s Plus , and the web interface to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advancements teamviewer , logmein , and gotoassist have made on their mobile apps in the years since screenconnects mobile interface has been put on the back burner . <p> Small business here . In fact , just a one man show . Stumbled upon Screen Connect after years of trying to find a remote software that would n't break the bank and bankrupt my business and that worked decently . Like some we used Logmein free until they cut that off and we were forced to look for alternatives . As soon as I saw Screen Connect I was sold . This was over 2 years ago . $325 for 1 year and then a great renewal cost , I host my own SC server so there is no middle man snooping through my stuff which puts customers at ease and which means no monthly costs because SC does n't host . This was perfect for us little guys . Now what 's happening ... I can tell the company is going away from the little guys and towards big companies . Even though I am a legacy member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because of the price increases I can no longer recommend SC to my other small business 's or one man shops because the prices are too high . I might as well look into Logmein or Teamviewer as comparable prices . I supported SC and paid the $325 and then the lower renewal cost knowing screen connect was no where near as polished as Teamviewer or Logmein , but I was okay with that . I pay a very reasonable cost and I would have to constantly report bugs and await improvements and fixes . Now , SC is asking for a lot more money for the same product . The same product meaning there are still a lot of bugs for SC to work out and should n't be asking for more money if their problems are n't fixed . Ex . ( Waking a computer does n't work . Same network , computer has everything turned on to wake and it does n't work . However I can download a simple magic packet broadcaster and my computer wakes just fine . As well as getting blank screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but shrug off because its not that important , the problem sometimes happens and shoot I am only paying $325 so I can live with it . VS , If I have to pay the new pricing and I experience these problems , I expect every day these problems occur and are not fixed I am reimbursed for that day because that would be unacceptable . So if you guys at Screen Connect believe your product is 100% working with no problems then you guys should be asking for more money . But your product is buggy , lacking several features that your competitors have and that are now within the same ball park cost . So this is a bad move . A very bad move and I do n't support it . <p> I purchased SC for these reasons ... <p> 1 . Self Hosting ( This is extremely important . ( I do n't want middle man servers logging data and snooping around . Only way to guarantee that is to self host ) 2 . Extremely helpful and friendly people at SC . ( Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same 5-10 people and I knew their names and they would remember me . Now It feels like a new person every time and I do n't get the same feeling of support I did before. ) 3 . Price was extremely fair . <p> I can say one thing though . If self hosting goes away for us legacy members and/or price goes up ( past a certain comfortable point ) I 'm out to find another company and you 'll lose my business and referrals . Maybe that 's what you want , is to widdle away the one man shows and the legacy members . We 'll find out if and when you decide to force legacy members to the new prices . <p> I 'm just glancing over this thread . I have has SC since 2008 and version 2. x .

We 're using the same codebase the new customer pricing model is using ( there is n't a separate " legacy " download ) . What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would require a code fork or a new licensing authentication system . It 'd be much cheaper for them to just kill legacy pricing than implement that . <p> b would require a code fork or a new licensing authentication system . It 'd be much cheaper for them to just kill legacy pricing than implement that . <p> They already have this in place . Tried to upgrade mine and by mistake it said it was going to do 2,500.00 option . Had to call up and get renewed by phone . So they do have a way to expire your license . <p> That 's disconcerting - was your license actually expired ( they 're only valid for 1 year ) ? . I 've checked mine a couple times and my legacy pricing is still available , but I 've also been diligent about keeping my license current . I suppose to some degree it makes sense as they must have a way to differentiate who gets what pricing . <p> What my thought was alluding more to was the fact that in order to actually DISABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a waste of resources if they can already just " flip the switch " and make everyone subject to new pricing . In addition , if they were n't going to support continued compatibility with legacy customers ( in other words a code fork - two products , different feature sets ) there would be no incentive for us to even bother to pay for it , so I 'm not sure what the real concern is there . <p> What my thought was alluding more to was the fact that in order to actually DISABLE software functionality like what the previous poster was suggesting would require a waste of resources if they can already just " flip the switch " and make everyone subject to new pricing .

Just that it looks like to have been mistakenly put in the their database as the 2,500.00 pricing . This license was purchased right before the announcement of increase/cloud ( days , less than a week I think ) so I upgraded them for more techs . This is how I found out about the increase . I actually found out a little before the announcement just by trying to upgrade and going " umm wtf " . <p> I do n't think it would be too hard to then flag the old licenses to the new pricing model when you went to upgrade them on the web site . Throwing in " switches " or disabling code would result in lawsuits . The EULA would not defend them at all but in fact sink them in court . So I do n't think they would do this . You would just be " stuck " at a certain version ( if you did n't pay the new licensing fees ) at some point in the future . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 5.5 version because I had been having problems with Windows 10 TH2 bug where clients would not reconnect after the Windows 10 upgrade and even after re-install I am having issues with clients not connecting after reboot . After seeing that it appears this company is trying to pull a Verizon on its loyal customers , think I am out . Why upgrade when it 's obvious in the near future you will lose your grandfathered in rates and be as screwed as new comers . Do n't build out all your remote connections only to have to redo them later when you have even more . Wise people know when to jump ship . ; ) I will start shopping again . I have over 200 unattended sessions which under their new pricing is ridiculous .. might as well drive there . I still remember when ScreenConnect was bought and I received the email saying " do n't worry , nothing is going to change " . I knew right then I was screwed . Charging those prices when we still have to host the server .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , in my experience , usually things go to hell . ScreenConnect sold us out to the highest bidder and then patted us on the shoulder and said " do n't worry , you 'll be fine " lol ; ) <p> P.S. <p> Your software is n't even working right with Windows 10 TH2 and you think this is a good time to increase new customer prices and lose the confidence of your old customers ? <p> I wonder how many of the legacy users who are paying any attention to this forum have posted in this thread . It 's one of the largest threads in this forum and I think it pretty much universally unfavorable . Not that I think it will lead to any change in the pricing model . At best it seems to me it could delay the day when we 're forced into the new pricing model . But even that seems unlikely . I really do n't think Connectwise has any interest in reversing course on the pricing . I think they 've thrown the little guys like me and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to get ( legacy pricing for an undefined timeframe ) . I think all that would make them change the new pricing model is if the market does n't think the software 's worth the price compared to the competition . Which is something I think most people would conclude . I know I would have discounted it almost immediately at that price when I was making my purchase decision about a year ago . After using it for a year I feel that it would have been the correct choice , too . <p> We value your partnership and investment in ScreenConnect . Our mission in 2016 continues to be Your Success !

Thanks for the reply Mike , it 's good to hear that you are honoring your legacy customers and I do sincerely hope this continues into the future . <p> Just under a year ago when our TeamViewer renewal came up we found ScreenConnect at around the same price as TeamViewer but it was self-hosted and offered triple the concurrent sessions for the same price . We have 50 technicians and 10 concurrent sessions which suffices . Remote Support is not really our primary business however all Technicians need access to this . <p> Had we done this with your new pricing model , self-hosted with similar features would have cost us a total of $39,560 or $29,400 per year which prices you well out of our market , I genuinely believe moving from the purely concurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remote from Mac to PC , or PC to Mac the client is the same . Speed is better than SC . SimpleHelp also provides support for VNC , RDP , port forwarding , remote console , machine monitoring , remote Windows registry , etc. etc. - it packs an incredible number of features . <p> We 've been using Screenconnect for the time being ( have n't renewed subscriptions - just going by on what we currently have ) . I was considering switching to Teamviewer until they 've gone the same direction . Will take a little while before I commit , but I might check out SimpleHelp again and see how it goes . <p> I think Screenconnect really missed a golden opportunity . Many disgruntled customers on Teamviewer at the moment looking for alternatives as well now . If SC had have kept their original plans and policies available to everyone as well as the new hosted features , I could imagine that they would have had a huge influx of users jumping from Teamviewer . <p> Will be interesting to see if Simple Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be comparable to what SC used to be ... <p> Putting aside the fact that the latest release is garbage . Crashes Ubuntu 14.02 which we have used as a host for years . The move to default downloads going to a " Temp " folder where most utilities wo n't run . The ridiculous installation of remote printers by default ( no fixed ) which pissed of my clients when 14 printers got added to each of their machines . The pricing model is actually not bad for all but 1 user shops with single session capability . I have three techs plus an occasional subcontractor . I have a 5 session license and candidly it 's not enough even for me alone . I have an 11 monitor workstation and routinely do maintenance on 8 machines or more simultaneously . The 3 user 10 session per would actually fit me better allowing for up to 30 simultaneous sessions for $2195 instead of $7500 on the old plan . I asked about trading up and they did not offer the normal upgrade pricing but much less . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simplehelp as well . As a professional I like having multiple tools at my disposal and not base my business on any one provider . <p> If you have a ScreenConnect license , you can get a renewal based on the old price . <p> I did purchase SimpleHelp , but I also renewed my ScreenConnect license . Neither is exactly like GoToAssist , but each has its own unique features . I 've canceled my GoToAssist subscription and will make do with the two tools I have . <p> I think that if they keep legacy customers at the same pricing , I will be fine with that . I have been using the product for almost 3 years and I love it . It does suck for people who are just now joining the software and I do believe the on premises software should be cheaper than what it is , but as long as MY pricing does n't change , I have no complaints . <p> As soon as their cloud option came out I feared self hosted customers were going to become second class citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a way to deter self hosted purchases . <p> I use to recommend SC to anyone looking for remote support software . At these new prices I ca n't say the software is worth it anymore , I always felt Bomgar and teamviewer were more polished products , but SC won on price . <p> I have the Unlimited License . To get the same amount of seats I have now it would cost me over $20,000 . I paid 1/5th that price . At the current price I would have NEVER even considered SC . <p> I 'll pay my renewal each year so long as legacy pricing is in place , and SC does n't abandon us self hosted . But I think this was a huge mistake . The old self hosted pricing gave Screen Connect a niche in the market that they have now abandoned . <p> I have had a few support issues , that SC has been very responsive to . I started out several years ago with a two session license for $650 and eventually upgraded to a 5 session license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enjoyed many of the new features that allow us to be more productive . <p> Now as far as the new licensing goes , you are in the technology industry , change is constant . Autocad--no longer sold--subscription only . 3 year license $5000 . Adobe moving that way , Microsoft moving that way . <p> If you are in the IT business and it does not merit $2195 for 3 concurrent users up to 30 sessions and you 've been doing it for years--you are in the wrong business . If your just starting out go subscription and build your business till self hosted makes sense . <p> Let 's examine a 10 year cost . $2195 + $660 per year for 9 years = $8135 or $67.80 a month-- assuming a 20 day work month $3.40 a day for up to 3 users and 30 sessions . <p> I run an 11 monitor station and frequently max out my old license . I an trading it in for the new program as it is much cheaper on per session basis . I have 3 employees and SC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower overall support costs tremendously . <p> Screenconnect , even under the new licensing , is still one of the cheapest tools I use . It literally costs me less than $1 a day per technician . <p> So far I have had zero issues about the quality of support screen connect has . I just think the price hike is a mistake . I was using gotoassist prior and it met my needs but I was paying $64/user/month . In your ten year breakdown screen connect is more expensive ! I would have never switched . <p> When I first purchased screenconnect , it was for 2 concurrent sessions ( no login limits ) . The software cost me $600 , with the expectation of an annual renewal cost of $120 . Using your ten year math , $600 + $120 for 9 years = $1680 total ten year expense compared to a minimum $8000 now . That 's a big difference . <p> I guess I 'm lucky I updated to the unlimited license when we did . I now have 20+ users with no session restrictions , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $11,200 , under the new model my cost would be closer to $2195+ ( 17 tech addon X $795 ) + $3142 per year for 9 years = $43,988 <p> I 'm paying 1/4 the current price and have none of the session restrictions ! <p> I find it a shame that the price in crease has come , I was uming and ahring about getting a license to help the family out and a few other bits and pieces . I can probabaly setup VNC but thought htis would be a good way of going at it .. However this has now put it well outside my price range . Maybe Ill setup a VN proxy for now .. <p> real shame this looked a promising product I was even going to move away from Teamviewer in the office to screen connect but know I will stay where I am teamviewer actually works out cheaper for me i think this is a big mistake ... <p> I 've had screenconnect for about two years now and it has been a great solution . Before I choose screenconnect I had compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple help . screenconnect has been an excellent experience , both the software and the support . Not perfect of course . <p> But I would never have bought it under the new pricing scheme . And , where I have been recommending sc to different companies , I ca n't really do that any longer .

If you 're unhappy with SC , you 're free to take your business elsewhere but to try to lure clients away from them is pretty shady . Only thing missing in there in an affiliate link . <p> It 's been a while now since the massive price hike for self-hosted users . Is there still no plan to force legacy users into the new pricing ? <p> Did n't they say they 'd re-evaluate the position each January ? Pretty sure they did : I have a note in my diary to renew in December . <p> I have a $600 two-session self-hosted legacy licence ( originally 2x $300 ) and at 80% discount at the end of year 1 it was $120pa to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it still pro-ratas the discount correctly - but more importantly - from the $600 price , not the $2000+ price . <p> We have 50 technicians and 10 concurrent sessions which suffices .

We are lucky to have a legacy self-hosted license but the new self-hosted pricing ( when it does begin to affect us ) is so far out of our price range that it is guaranteed we will leave SC the moment we are forced out of legacy pricing . I understand the push to get people on SC cloud but even giant companies like Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud pricing that allows for them to still meet their cloud adoption goals . Connectwise does n't yet appear to get that concept .

Windows versions prior to Vista do not dynamically load system variables so the LTclientname and LTcomputername system variables are not accessible on XP machines until the machine restarts so the SC installer can not access those variables.2 .

@@96443856 @643856/ <p> The team at ScreenConnect has n't started testing on the Chrome OS yet . It is something we 're going to look at in the future , but have been focusing on the major platforms at the moment . Do you have a Chromebook or were you considering picking one up ? <p> I am on a chromebook as I write this . The simple answer is NO . If you try to run it , it says that " **34;8907;TOOLONG is not supported " . Hopefully it will work sometime in the future . I will keep my fingers crossed . <p> Sorry , but Java on a Chromebook is almost certainly never going to happen officially . Problem being , Chrome OS is designed to be robust and secure ... absolutely and unequivocally . Java ( or supporting Java ) really does n't lend itself to that methodology for reasons we 're all aware of . <p> The only option is to build a plugin for the actual browser itself - but for the moment , Chrome Remote Desktop should suffice . If the situation changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my new Chromebook . I am very interested in have the client part working in Chrome OS . Maybe a Chrome plugin . I do all my remote support with ScreenConnect , and being a Google Apps reseller / Google Apps Sales specialist , makes sense to use Chromebook ... Several of my clients are on logmein/free and it works straight out of Chrome . <p> I am ready to beta test if needed . Maybe even sponsor Screenconnect a Chromebook . <p> Considering most certainly ! It is not currently at the top of the development list but certainly something we are considering and have spent a little time looking at the market and what might be available from a support perspective . I will make sure and put these +1 's on the list and mention it to development . <p> We have some preliminary feedback that some control/viewing is probably possible with Chromebook . However this really only applies to the contents of the Chrome browser . Initial feedback from development is that actually seeing the desktop and some of the local tools ( not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is a limitation of the Chrome OS . <p> I worked with Google during the dev &amp; pilot of ChromeOS , and the topic of remote control came up . <p> It 's absolutely not possible with major hacking required ( chromebook must be and remain in dev mode ) or java installed . As I mentioned last year , there 's no way they 'll include java natively ... it 's completely at odds with the whole premise of ChromeOS . <p> Just to clarify , we 're not disputing if it 's possible to remote connect to a ChromeOS browser . Google have their own remote connect client for just this purpose , though it 's not much good . <p> The issue , is the inability to control the core operating system ; or indeed *anything* outside the browser . This is absolute and a fundamental part of the ChromeOS design principle . Only caveat to that would be privilege escalation , but that 'd be classed as an exploit and almost certainly patched just as soon as it 's wrapping into a product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against remote control being given to someone other than the user sitting in front of a Chromebook , that would n't prevent us as a Screenconnect Host user from controlling someone 's Windows or Mac computer though , would it ? <p> I spend about 2/3 of my time on the road these days , and carry only a Chromebook . I 'd dearly love to be able to log into clients ' Windows PCs using Screenconnect from the Chromebook . Right now , I keep an old Windows laptop permanently turned on in my office and use Chrome 's Remote Desktop to control it from my Chromebook , and use Screenconnect from the Windows laptop to connect to clients ' PCs . <p> We use LogMeIn Central right now and we give our techs Chromebooks to take with them in the field to be able to put in their ConnectWise time and , if needed , jump on a remote session with LMI .

We 've been using LogMeIn which works from the Chromebook just fine , but we have been planning a switch ( 1000+ employees ) to ScreenConnect . Any reason why SC can not do what LMI is doing already ? <p> Working from Chromebook I believe requires a Chrome OS specific app , do n't quote me on that but I seem to remember that from my conversations with development . IT really just comes down to resources and prioritization . We have a lot of requests for different functionality and we weigh those against several factors . I will check priority and add your +1 and nudge development a bit . <p> Thanks for the nudge . With LogMeIn , it just works directly in the Chrome browser on the ChromeBook by visiting logmein.com and logging in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app . Perhaps there is some fundamental architecture difference with ScreenConnect that does not allow it work directly through the browser ? I 'm keeping my fingers crossed that the dev team figures it out . I 'm loving the ChromeBook more every day and this is the only major drawback that I 've come across . <p> +1 Here also . I am loving my Chromebook , was disappointed when I tried to log in to a host pc and could n't connect . Even worse , I tried using the " URLlaunch " method , which triggers chrome to endlessly open new tabs . <p> Personally , my first priority would be to get the host connection working , so we can administer existing hosts . 2nd would be to build a Chromebook installer ( service ? , extension ? ) <p> Thanks Guys for all your great work , we love using SC internally and every time I share with others , its nothing but compliments . <p> Started to roll through this and do n't want to hijack this forum post but cc92260 please shoot me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make sure and capture that in more detail .. thanks . <p> Sure thanks . Just an FYI for anyone looking to control Chromebook . Probably the best any tool will be able to do is view/control the browser of Chromebook . Not the actual OS and other tools/functionality that falls outside the browser on the device . I am certainly not an expert but I have spoken with our developers and read a lot on the subject and while there are some misleading marketing messages on the internet it appears this is a limitation of the OS . <p> Just because you consider it a " toy " not to be used in a " real " business , does n't mean others do n't have a use for it . Personally , I see iPads and such to be more toy than tool ... but they are everywhere now . Even in " Real " businesses . <p> As for Chromebooks , we are starting to see them more and more in K-12 education . Yes , I do consider education and the IT departments in education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a place here and even if I did n't feel that they do ... The school board makes the choice on equipment and if they want it , we get it . In turn , I have to support it . Since I use screenconnect to work remotely on our Windows desktops and laptops ... it would be very convenient to be able to work on Chromebooks that way as well . <p> If a native ChromeOS extension is not possible , what about a port of the android app ? The app works great on my Note3 and I have heard Google recently released some tools to help in porting Android apps to ChromeOS . Maybe this could be a path worth looking into ... <p> ( by the way I 'd like to see a ChromeOS device being used by the technician , not as a necessarily as a host device ) <p> I do n't think I 'll ever use a Chromebook ( for many many reasons ) but supporting them does make sense IMHO .

These credentials are stored privately via a windows service and associated with the sessionID . The credentials are available as long as the session number does not change , so for example the Access Sessions do not change the Session I 'd , so one could access the machine and from Toolbar ( Miscellaneous ) send " Ctrl+Alt+Delete " to access a user sign in page and then select " Send to Screen " to have the username and password populate with the stored credentials .
