Hals comment was so long I saved it for its own post . Take it away , " Hal " : <p> With regards to Sleepy Hollow and the La Vida Mineral Springs resort , all I can tell you is what I know from my limited personal experiences . <p> The La Vida complex was a resort that goes back quite a few years . At some point the hotel closed ( perhaps due to a fire ) but the structure remained till the 1990s , although essentially abandoned and neglected . It was bulldozed in the mid-1990s sometime after it was discovered that unsavory types were manufacturing speed inside the old building . <p> The mineral springs and swimming pool were kept open for quite a while after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , people could pay to get access to the pool and such , without staying at the resort . Since no one had a pool where we lived , my parents used to drive us to La Vida on weekends or during summer to go swimming ( dodging tarantulas and rattlesnakes on the , then , much narrower and more treacherous Carbon Canyon Road ) . This would be in the 1950s and 1960s . They also had one of those things called a Swingin Gym which was kind of an enclosed cage that two people could manipulate to sway back and forth . It was like a ride at the fair which you had to power with your body movements . At some point , perhaps the late 1970s early 1980s , the pool and mineral spings were also closed down . <p> This left only the La Vida Cantina Restaurant . A variety of folks ran the place and it became a pretty cool biker hang-out with a few pool tables . The place had indoor and outdoor stages which catered generally , though not exclusively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Satellites , Rick Derringer , Lee Rocker ( formerly of The Stray Cats ) , Coco Montoya , Buddah Heads ( that 's their spelling , not mine ) , James Harman , Guitar Shorty , Walter Trout and a latter day version of the Jefferson Starship ( with Paul Kantner ) played the venue . The crowds were always small because the place just did n't  hold that many folks . Even the outdoor stage seating was extremely limited . There was a band called Three Blind Mice that opened shows a lot . <p> The food was n't as bad as you might think . For diner / dive type fare it was OK . The place was what it was ! I felt comfortable there , though some might have found the regular biker clientele a bit threatening . When I say biker , I mean true biker . Not these weekender doctor / lawyer types . These people were the real deal . The waitresses were generally really hot biker chicks . <p> They had all-you-can-eat spaghetti for a dollar mid-week . On that same day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the 1990s ! ! It was a hell of a deal ! ! You never have seen such a funny sight as the tables full of senior citizens enjoying the bargain pasta at a hardcore biker dive ( and of course they ordered pitchers of free water as their beverage ) . For the money , the food was great . It was surprisingly good . Also on weekdays they had a cheap taco day and an all-you-can-eat rib day ( 4 bucks ) . The cook was an ex-con named Don who also worked at the old Canyon Corral in Chino Hills ( corner Peyton Dr. and Chino Hills Parkway ) . <p> I remember a comical suituation once when I arrived at the La Vida Cantina with my wife , " Hadla , " for an early dinner . No waitresses had showed up , so a big bellied biker , wearing oily Levis and a leather vest with no shirt underneath , became our server . It was great because we could tell he did n't  enjoy his new unwanted temporary job at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salad . The biker asked me what kind of dressing I wanted . I asked if they had Italian dressing . He replied , " Whattya think dis is de ( expletive ) Ritz Carlton or somethin ? ! ? ! " <p> Just the sight of this guy , his attitude , and the whole situation made both my wife and I convulse with laughter . I have often said that if I could duplicate that scene in a movie it would make a great moment . I guess you really had to be there . I settled for the Bleu Cheese after laughing my ass off . <p> There was also a bar in the Sleepy Hollow area called Jack Taters . It was a hangout . Sleepy Hollow attracted a lot of counterculture types during the 60s , 70s , 80s and maybe later , but I cant say from personal experience . I liked it there despite my older brothers warnings that there were a bunch of " acid freaks " living up there . There were a few musicians who lived there . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One closed quite a while back and was converted to a home . The other is still there , I think . It was a Party House Liquor Store for a time . The store had a covered picnic table area next to it . Locals would buy their beer and such and congregate at the tables and enjoy the company and libations . <p> Another cool feature of the liquor store was that many of Sleepy Hollows female residents photos were posted on a large bulletin board near the register . Since Sleepy Hollow was a " free spirited " community , most of these photos were topless shots of the local gals . For instance , a guy like myself could be in the store buying a six pack , admiring the photos and then realize that two of the women behind him in the store were also in the photos . This was store policy right through the 1980s with fresh pictures always being posted . It gave the store and the community a personality . <p> It ended when the City Of Chino Hills incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral crusade . The first things the City Of Chino Hills did upon founding were to get the pictures out of the Sleepy Hollow liquor store and disallow the partying at the tables next to the building . It really ended the loose sense of community in the area . <p> Immediately after the City Of Chino Hills did that , their top priority was becoming the first city to outlaw smoking . The city also adopted a very harsh attitude toward bar owners , specifically the Canyon Corral and Grazianos . But that 's a complicated story for another time . <p> In the mid-1960s there was also a short-lived fake ski business on one of the hills in the canyon . Some " genius " thought it would be a great idea to have people ski down a hill on some fake plastic or teflon snow . They even built a small resort complex for the fake skiing folks to stay . It did n't  last . Perhaps they got sued by skiers who hurt themselves , I do n't  know . Eventually counterculture types moved into the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area was known affectionately as The Purple Haze . <p> There was also a great tire swing near this area that hung over the creek which runs alongside Carbon Canyon Road . " The Swing " at The Purple Haze was a hangout for many people in the community . <p> The only unanswered question : What would Washington Irving have to say about Sleepy Hollow ? <p> There was a terrible wildfire that swept thru this area too , in the early 90s <p> " Hal and Hadla Linker " <p> The La Vida Cantina met its demise when the propreitor died unexpectedly and the liquor license couldnt be transferred , at least that 's what I have been told . The place had a full bar , it was n't just a beer and wine joint . <p> It was fenced off with chain link fence for quite some time afterwards , before being bulldozed into a memory . It was a sad day for bikers and all those who enjoyed the funky atmosphere and informality of the place . <p> I believe the liquor store in Sleepy Hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyon wildfire was either in 1990 or 1991 and destroyed some Sleepy Hollow homes randomly , as fires of that type are wont to do , along with burning vast hillside acres of brush . <p> There was also St. Josephs Hill Of Hope . This was a gated cult religion in the hills who believed that Jesus would return for his Second Coming on said hill . I think they gave up but , who knows , maybe they 're still waiting . <p> Sleepy Hollows slightly freaky community somewhat paralleled what was happening in Laurel and Topanga canyons . <p> And , by the way , Hadla reminds me that the unwilling biker server mentioned in the original post was also scratching his crotch as he waited on us . The guy was priceless ! ! ! <p> Miss T <p> I went to see a rockabilly show at the La Vida Roadhouse in around 2000 or 2001 . It was shortly after that the owner died and it was shut down . Its such a shame because it was the perfect place to drink some booze while enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the La Vida Roadhouse a few times for some small time hippy gigs , including one with an Allman Bros Cover band , a Cheap Trick cover band , and ( the real reason we went ) Cubensis who is a great Grateful Dead cover band out of Los Angeles . In the parking lot , I bought a small laser pointer off of some guy . During the Cheap Trick pseudo set I was sitting all the way in back at the tables shooting lasers all over the place and especially at the guitar players fret board . He kept looking around , amazed , thinking something really bizarre was happening his pupils were as big as quarters , as were most of ours quite frankly . After the set , he came right up to me and said " That is the first gig where I was staring at the person FARTHEST from the stage . " He shook my hand and thanked me profusely . <p> Another time , this time on the outdoor stage , the David Nelson Band ( Of New Riders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand fell and somehow missed everyone in the crowd . Amazing . That night there was a guy walking around with stickers that said rude things ( far too rude for this blog , I dare say ) and sticking them on peoples backs .

Also of note , there was very little law enforcement presence up there which , for people who like to really party and get down , is a huge plus . Yes , you could really let your freak flag fly at La Vida ! <p> " Hal Linker " <p> Miss T : Just out of curiousity , which bands did you see at that rockabilly show ?

Anybody know if there 's any truth to these stories ? <p> " Hal Linker " <p> here 's a very old postcard of what mineral springs area looked like before the pool and other concrete went in at a much later date . <p> The La Vida Mineral Springs Resort with hotel opened 1924 . It was opened by William Newton Miller and his son-in-law . They began bottling the mineral water circa 1928 and sold it as " La Vida Lemon and Lime . " <p> The postcard photo is pre-resort . <p> " Hal Linker " <p> Ah , yes , Cubensis , I remember they opened for the Buddah Heads once out at Moose McGillycuddys out in Long Beach . They were also regulars at Santa Monicas 14 Below and The Foothill in Long Beach . <p> Speaking of copy bands , which is a trend at clubs which continues to grow , back in the late 1970s and early 1980s the seeds for this were sown by long deceased bands like The White ( led by Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the Rolling Clones . Then came Wild Child ( The Doors tribute band which still carries on ) before a plethora of others . <p> I was in a band which did all originals circa late 1970s / early 1980s . We had a Stonesy type of sound circa their Mick Taylor period . For some reason the Rolling Clones could not make a gig at the Handlebars Saloon ( now defunct ) out in Santa Ana and they asked our band if we could fill in . <p> The gig involved three copy bands . An Alice Cooper copy band ( who may have been called Billion Dollar Babies but I really do n't  remember ) , us filling in last minute for the Rolling Clones ( who the crowd expected ) and the White ( the Led Zepp copy band I mentioned the lead singer videotaped every sex act he had with groupies I think primarily so that he could admire himself Michael White , what an ego ! ) . <p> When we hit the stage the rowdy crowd was obviously disappointed that we werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mick and the boys as the clones did . We did " Let It Bleed , " " Gim me Shelter , " " Sympathy For the Devil , " " Jumpin Jack Flash , " and " Happy " before doing our originals .

Seems the crowd wanted only Stones done by Stones look-alikes . <p> Well , our bass player was a pretty hot headed guy and he did n't  appreciate the bottle flying past his head so he grabbed the long neck Strohs off of his amp and made a direct hit on the perpetrator . This caused a riot ! This was a very rough bar ! Roadies and band members were in hand to hand with bikers . Our chicks were fighting their chicks ! Police had to be called out .

All Hail Bucky Fuller ! <p> There were also several hippie types who were living in a small abandoned church in the Hollow .

There were remnants of original furnishings , a funky kitchen with the old cold cupboard still in place , and a hand painted sign outside that said " HeadQuarters . " I do n't  think I need say more ! <p> It was the early eighties when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain flavor about it . I loved walking down Oak to the store and hearing the phone ring there . It was always answered , " Party House Liquorthe ONLY business in town ! " There was a five gallon Sparklets water jug on the counter that everyone pitched change into , and the money went for the annual party there in the Hollow Definitely the end of an era . <p> Thanks for the local color , Nancy . DA <p> Don <p> We moved into a new home in Brea in 1962 . Once a week , during the summer , we would drive past La Vida and go swiming at the Carbon Canyon Country Club . It was next to the plastic ski area . There was horse riding , swimming , shuffle board , minature golf and roller skating . We loved our summer months there . We never had a problem with people there . <p> For a short time , we watched skiiers come down the hill . It was made on a cement base and there were 1 foot square plastic tiles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down all over the hill . Most of them have decomposed . I actually sold that hillside and back behind it to a developer around about 1984 . It had a plan for houses on it but nothing was done . <p> We also swam at La Vida a time or two and watched the people swing in the people swings . I remember dodging the tarantulas a few summers . There were thousands of them . I wonder why that was and why it is no longer a problem ? <p> Speaking of the area , we used to also hike up to the Nike Base when it was a Nike Base . Sometimes the military guys would let us get a drink inside the base . We also went to the Tonner Canyon Scout Reserve and hiked to a fort in the middle of nowhere . Lots of great memories of that time and place . <p> Victor Murray <p> At least 40 years ago , two friends and I were traveling north in Carbon Canyon , and stopped at La Vida Hot Springs to look around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of my sister , brother , and many cousins , posing with glasses of La Vida water . They were young children , and the picture was taken just before I was born . <p> Someone in our family had a copy of this photo which I had seen several times , but I do n't  know what happened to it over the years . It was quite a shock as an adult to see this photo on the wall of the La Vida company . <p> The terrible fire this year , 2008 , reminded me of that visit I made so long ago . I 'm 76 years old now , and I wish I had a copy of that picture to post on our family website . I 'd be amazed if anyone had any information about the disposition of such a photograph as that , but its a small world , and miracles do happen , especially on the Internet . I would be pleased to see that photograph again . <p> Donna <p> Ah yes , the hot springs . My ex-ol man and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some food . We met some very cool people . Some wore their colors and some did not depending on the mood . We partied and enjoyed life . It was a place to relax and get crazy , I am truly sorry to hear that progress ( again ) destroyed a ( what I call a historical ) place . Is Cooks Corner still open ? <p> Peace . <p> Donna Hayes <p> Michele <p> Yes ! Cooks Corner is alive and well . They have added on to the back , with outside bands and more room for " hanging out . " <p> Michele <p> In 1990-1991 we went to La Vida for the regular Sunday afternoon of having some cold beers and people watching . They always had good bands outside and pool tables inside . <p> I remember one night , we met a bunch of bikers and were invited to their house for a party/bbq . We did n't  know anyone , but decided to go . The owner of the house had a big wolf on top of the roof in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between all the trees , and the wolf . <p> We partied , met some eccentric people , decided it was time to get out before nightfall and headed back down through Carbon Canyon back to the Chino Hills area . Loved La Vida and was really bummed out when it closed . <p> EL KABONG ! <p> Re : Rockabilly acts at La Vida Cantina . <p> I saw the Paladins , The Blazers , and a few other acts there in the late 90s ( ? ) <p> Too bad its gone , it had a high suavity factor . <p> Dolly <p> Just wanted to thank you all for bring back some nice memories . <p> On Christmas Eve , I stopped by the area of La Vida . For a moment as I closed my eyes , I could still hear the laughter and music . In the early to mid 70s , as a young teenager , I would stop by the liquor store in Sleepy Hollow to relax and water my horse . I would talk to some of the locals . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but most were interesting and or entertaining . Because of the amount of people around , I always felt safe . <p> It is a shame the City of Chino Hills council members ( the ones who all had campaigns saying they wanted " to preserve our rural atmosphere " ) have continued voting to take away the atmosphere . <p> I would like to say thank you to the fire fighters for saving the Hollow once again . They put up a hell of a fight . <p> God Bless To All , Dolly <p> kenny <p> I used to go to La Vida Mineral Springs in the 60s and all the way through approximately 1975 . It was great . It was my alternative to the beach during summer vacations . <p> My grandparents took us kids there in the 60s all the time to go swimming and eat and spend the day . My grandparents would go into the hot pool while us kids stayed in the big cooler pool . <p> I really wish there were old pics of the place in the 50s and 60s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the resort but no full shots of the area . <p> I was so sad to see it absolutely gone when I decided to take a drive through and found only a chain link fence around where the cafe once stood . I miss it . <p> Blessings , <p> Kenny <p> Mark <p> I moved to Olinda Village as a 12-year-old in 1964 . The owner of La Vida the Dickensons lived across the street from us . We went to a small two-room schoolhouse of about 50 students , 1st thru 8th grade . We would all walk to La Vida to get banana splits . <p> My brother worked as a lifeguard there in the summer around 1966 and 1967 , and I remember when that hammer type ride was added . <p> A few of our classmates lived along Carbon Canyon Road as far away as Sleepy Hollow . Donald Dayton lived right next to what used to be the Sleepy Hollow Inn and before the liquor store . Another one , Chuck Kraemer , lived on a ranch near La Vida . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was an investor in the ski resort plastic with bristles my friends and myself worked putting the tiles down . I went skiing there several times . It was fashioned after a similar resort in Japan , but it did soon died out . <p> That location was originally our country club for Olinda Village . It had two Olympic size pools a roller rink horse stables where we would rent horses and there was an old large abandoned theatre house complete with stage that we used to walk through . This was from 1964 to 1969 . <p> After that time I lived in a house right on Carbon Canyon road just before the Phillips 66 gas station . We as hippies of the time would be getting loaded and watch the Brea police drive to the end of their jurisdiction and turn around at the gas station.There was also a cafe called Ichabods . <p> All of us were living at Olinda Village , and all but one were attending the Olinda school from 1964 to 1967 . <p> Mike E ( M.E. Ross ) <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there in the middle of the night , down a spooky dirt road at Lions Head , to the " insane asylum " that supposedly was back there . LSD , the moon , and midnight on a road to a crazy house used to scare the hell out of us . And we never found the nut house . So we went back often . <p> One of the last times I was at La Vida Cantina , I was front man in a band called Speeds All Stars for the Vagos , a biker club from the Corona and O.C. area . It was a great outdoor gig . So now I 'm sad to hear that it is no more . All the good places are goneor maybe all the good people are . Or they 're hiding . <p> So , to the La Vida Cantina , and all the great times in Carbon Canyon , I salute you ! <p> VANCE STEARNS <p> Some interesting articles indeed . I was born and raised in the Sleepy Hollow area of Carbon Canyon and remeber a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constable at Dot and Floyds and I remember going there . It was turned into a market by Joe Norris whose son owned the gas station at a later date . It was originally owned by big Dan . <p> When I was 12 or 13 I worked at Canyon Hills Country Club in the Skate shack playing 33s of Paul Anka and then they built the miniature golf course and they moved the rentals of everything up there . There were a lot of good times growing up in the hollow and I still live in the area of Mt . View today . Swam at La Vida and my mom waitressed there in the 60s . A lot of history in the area . <p> I moved to Sleepy Hollow in 1997 and still live there next to what is now the Community Center . The old fire house was still there then and served as the Community Center until it was condemned and torn down about 6 or 7 years ago . I also understand that there was a bar where the community center parking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> La Vida bar and restaurant was still there when I moved there as well . It was owned by a guy named Don who had owned it for about 20 years at the time . Don was a nice guy . From what I understand he had some connections in the music business because he worked in it at one time . That 's why all the the great bands that played there . <p> I used to go in there and have breakfast on Sunday mornings and hang around for the band to play outside in the afternoon . I remember one time about 10 or 11 years ago my sister drove up here from Fontana and brought her neighbor who was celebrating his 21st birthday so we took him to La Vida . I believe it was on a Sunday . When those bikers found out it was that kids birthday they proceeded to get him so drunk that we practically had to pour him out of the place when it was all said and done ! Last time I saw him he still talked about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a problem with them . They treated us like we were old friends . <p> I remember when Don died and it was a shock . He had a lot of health problems though so it was a surprise but then again it was n't . I miss that place . There 's nothing up here anymore except the liquor store but its still a beautiful place to live . Ive been here almost 12 years and have really enjoyed it . Except for the fire last year . God bless those firefighters ! Every damn one of them is a hero ! <p> I was n't here " back in the day " but I understand this area has a lot of history so keep the stories coming ! If anybodys got any old pics put them up if you can ! <p> Brad <p> I used to play with a band called Roscoe around Orange County between 1977 till about 1996 . One of our favorite places to play was La Vida Hot Springs . <p> At that time the hot springs and pools were closed but there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an indoor stage inside the restaurant , and an outdoor stage built across the creek , which flowed underneath . I remember at one time the county came in and told Chris that a permit had never been taken out to build that stage . Chris replied that it was only a temporary stage and that no permit was needed . The city said Bull so Chris knew a guy who had a helicopter business and had him come out and lift it about 3 feet off the ground . So the county let him keep it . <p> Sundays were the big days out on the lawn , and the days when most of the bikers showed up . My band never had any trouble there , probably because some of us were bikers . <p> I got married June 12th , 1982 , and had my second wedding reception on June 13th . Chris cut me a really good deal for the catering , which I far exceded , so to pay off my tab , I did a singles act on Saturdays in the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Vida holds a special place in my heart . We live in a different country now , and nobody has the freedom that we enjoyed back then . We have been legislated and taxed to death . Viva La Vida , may she live again . Brad <p> Chris Farren <p> I grew up in Olinda/Carbon Canyon and went to both the Old and New Olinda School . I lived on the Oil Lease across from what is now Carbon Canyon Park and the Dam . <p> As a teenager , I worked at La Vita Resort as the Life Guard during the summer and did maintenance work during the winter months . <p> I remember the cafe back then served frog legs . I like them but never asked where they got them . <p> As for Sleepy Hollow , I had an uncle that lived there and the scariest thing during that time was the bars , people drinking too much and the car accidents on Carbon Canyon Road . Most of them never made it through all the corners and turns . Crashes were a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my autograph book from the New Olinda with the first class kids names , plus teacher . If you were part of the class you cant forget Miss Cotton and music time . We all knew Peter Paul and Mary songs but did n't  sound as good . <p> We had the best time growing up there , somewhat isolated but we created our fun , and I remember only one broken arm . <p> Leslie Moog Slavens <p> I lived in Carbon Canyon from 1973-1981 . I worked with Chris Cromwell for a few years . He had a lot of bands at LaVida . One local band was " Coyote " . I heard Chris died a few years ago .. so sad .. i saw him after his bypass heart surgery around 1990 when his dad drove him to my house to say hiRIP Chris <p> Tony Anthony <p> This is for Leslie Moog Slavens . I lived in The Canyon for a time it was before Chris started in Lavida . I had moved to Oakland and would return to The Canyon from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best friend during the time I lived in the Canyon . I lost touch with him and Christine . His passing shook me . What a time he and I had and my son Tony was along for most of it . The Canyon was quite a place to live I have great memories I think anything you hear about it is most likely true . What a time was had by all . <p> Tony <p> Maryann <p> I enjoyed reading your article as it reminded me of the 10 years ( 1988-1998 ) I lived at the base of the canyon near the Eucalyptus groves in Chino Hills , before all the development ruined the area . <p> I made the winding drive through the canyon past the horse farms every work day going past La Vida and Sleepy Hollow . We used to go shoot pool at the Cantina and enjoyed the great blues music there . The bikers were a fixture but they never bothered us . We looked like professional type people in t shirts and jeans on the weekend . The hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think they tore it all down after I moved away to Ontarios historical area . <p> There was a geo-dome home in the Hollowthe first I had ever seen standing . I still miss the area the way it was when I first moved there . Now there are huge homes where the oil derricks used to be in Olinda . I guess you ca n't stop progress and shopping centers galore all along what was Church Row on Peyton in Chino Hills and the Canyon Corral has been gone for a long time nowI loved that place too . <p> Leslie Moog Slavens <p> Hi Tony , just saw your post . I have tried to find Christine Cromwell but to no avail . Also , were you aware Chris and Christine had a son ? Chris ended up raising him after their divorce . Daniel was spittin image of Chris . I have a pic of Chris that I would be glad to scan and email to you . Tony , were you in the house that was a couple doors up from Christines ? Your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leslie <p> Bill Johson <p> The name of the " night-club " cum bar was " Joe Taters Oak Grove Inn . " <p> Joe was ( maybe still is ) a great guy , he and his wife ran the inn . Joe was famous in Orange County as a nightclub entertainer and piano player . He was most noted for his " I do n't  any more " singalong songs where everyone would join in . <p> Chris Cromwell and I were buddies too . I was the President of the Town Hall for a year and a member of the Sleepy Hollow Volunteer Fire Dept . I owned a small house , a property across the road . We used to shop at " Freds Store " across the road and party at the " Purple Haze " just down the road . <p> They were great times but you know it had to end , there was way too much crazy stuff going on in the canyon in those days . I married a local girl , Patty Robinson , and we lived there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can forget all of the very unique characters that lived there .. but do n't  get me started . It would take weeks . <p> What a pleasant surprise I stumbled onto this blog as I was attempting to reconnect with some childhood chums . <p> I grew up in Sleepy Hollow/Carbon Canyon , CA cir. 1949-1973 . It was a tight knit community then , especially at the earlier end of that spectrum . Life there was tranquil in the extreme I do n't  think my parents ever locked a door or took the keys out of the car . Few had phones , so communicating was done face-to-face . To the best of my knowledge we had the first TV in the " hollow , " the antenna for which had to be " precision adjusted " by hand when the channel was switched to one of the other two available . <p> Story told short , it was a great , tranquil place to be brought up in the warmth , camaraderie and guidance of people who , for the most part , genuinely cared for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Dots cafe . Their son , Dennis ( Frampton ) , and I sold bunches of mistletoe and holly we collected from the nearby woods to the tipsy patrons to earn Christmas money . <p> Though I started school at Richard Gird Elementary in Chino , I later transferred to the two room school in Olinda grades K through 4 on Mrs. Addys side , 5th through 8th on Mrs. MacDonalds side . The latter remarried somewhere around my 6th grade year and became Mrs. Keilor . Our bus driver , custodian , and woodshop teacher was Vern last name escapes me at the moment . My 8th grade graduating class was the last before the historic school and village were leveled to build the flood control dam that for so many years held back nothing but tumbleweeds . I attended and graduated from Brea-Olinda Union High School , class of 1964 . <p> The first ( high school ) job from which I had actual tax deductions taken out of my $1.25/hr minimum wage was as a dishwasher in the restaurant at LaVida mineral springs . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced Swaps , who won the 1995 Kentucky Derby . While attending college , I too worked on the early construction of Ski Villa , the artificial slope mentioned by a couple of people here in earlier posts . I also worked one summer on the small oil field in Soquel Canyon , and briefly as a young adult at Aerojet General , forming and welding rare metals with explosives . <p> Growing up in Sleepy Hollow is an indelible part of my childhood . I think , if pressed , I could identify/recall nearly every house and occupant in the community of that era . <p> here 's a partial list of some of the my friends/classmates with whom I shared such youthful pursuits as : exploring the hills on foot and horseback , playing army , building tree houses and forts , damming up the creek to make our own swimming holes , rigging up horrendous rope swings over chasms , and sharing sundaes at Icabods cafe . <p> Jack Smith Carl Farren Kathy Berry ( had a terrible crush on her ) Jimmy Gray he survived the carnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he worked with his dad . <p> My best friend in high school was Hank Sybrandy , whose parents built/operated a Christian retreat across the road from ( the new ) Olinda Elem. school . <p> Life takes over we 've scattered and lost contact . Of all those mentioned above the only two I have reconnected with are Rick and Hank . I 'd enjoy hearing and sharing a story or two from anyone living in Carbon Canyon in the timeframe , or those interested in that period of local history . Please feel free to contact me . <p> Bob Norris <p> Did n't  you live next to Joe and Thresa Norris ? <p> Dan Moore <p> I lived on Francis Dr. from 1983 til 98 when we moved down hill to town . Remember the Cantina well . Satellite for ballgames ! <p> Used to buy my beer at the Party House cause Willie always stocked unique imports . Jeff Weiler was a good friend . <p> That 90 fire was a beast . Stupidly , I was 1 of only 2 that did not evac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look to the hills from wherever I was during the day when we had windy conditions . <p> We live in NC now and havent been thru the canyon in 6 yrs . <p> Bill Johnson <p> Do any of you remember : <p> Jimmy Trusho aka Jimmy t-bar or " Sage " or Dennis and Debbie or any of the locals at the " Purple Haze . " <p> I remember Freds Store real well . Used to shop there all the time . <p> Zachary Cromwell <p> Wow . Talk about binging back memories . My dad Chris Cromwell ran La Vida for some time and I grew up going there . <p> I was even bus boy for a short time . It was such a fun time and I got all the free food , video games , bands , and pool that I wanted . It was an interesting time growing up as a kid around all those bikers and bands . I loved it . Everyone was so good to me and I never had a problem even though there were some scuffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different back then and it breaks my heart every time I drive by La Vida and see just a vacant lot . <p> In a previous post someone talked about riding on the swinging gyms that were at the La Vida Hot Springs . I am 35 now and when I was a teenager we used to go into the swings after hours and ride them . Looking back now I know how dangerous this was as the swings had not been used in years and were so rusted , but boy did we have some fun . <p> here 's to Party House Liquor Store #2 , Oakway Lane and Sleepy Hollow . Carbon Canyon is a very unique place and so was La Vida . I still live in Chino Hills and this area will always hold a special place in my heart . here 's to all those who made this area such an interesting place to grow up in . Thanks to all of you . You know who you are . <p> I also want to thank the firefighters who worked so hard to put out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on forever telling stories but I had better stop here as some stories are better left untold . = <p> Michael Smith <p> In the late 1990s , I wan na say 1998 , the best band I ever played for ( " Manta " ) regrouped after disbanding a few years before and played at La Vidas . <p> At the time , I had no idea really even of the approximate location of the place . Coming from Ontario , I was given directions to take the 60 Fwy to the 57 south , exit Lambert , make a left and head into the canyon again , having no idea that this road would connect directly into Chino Hills Parkway . For years I would think of the place ( La Vidas ) from time to time wondering exactly where the hell it was located . <p> A few years ago I was conversing with someone , reflecting on " Old Times . " I mentioned my regular hangout at a place called " The Boars Head " in Upland , which has been gone for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( La Vidas ) and I totally put it together that he was describing the Mystery Place in the canyon I 'd played at several years prior . <p> I went driving through the canyon looking for the former site of La Vidas with no success initially ( it was nighttime ) . The next day , after several passes by the general area , I caught a glimpse of the chimney with the name " La Vida Cantina " still written on it . I stopped my truck , got out and reminisced of that surreal night we played there . It was a really good time , we felt very welcomed there , and there 's no doubt in my mind it was a place to be . <p> When I read the story of the lady who stopped her car at the location and closed her eyes to hear the laughter and music , she made me hear it too . Its moments like these that I still continue to live for . Thanks to all who wrote about the place " La Vida Cantina . " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mike <p> Bill Johnson <p> As far as bands godo any of you remember the band " Coyote " ? They were locals and used to play at La Vita all the time . I knew all the members of the band and we partied together at the old Puple Haze . <p> Brad Stiewel <p> Remember Coyote very well . It at one time was Tim Harwood on steel , Tom Harwood on bass , Dave Harwood on drums and their brother-in law on guitar . Dave had type 1 diabetes and i heard a while back that he had gone blind , but that the nucleus of the band was still playing somewhere around Santa Fe springs . Coyote used to also play at the Longhorn Saloon in Covina when I was a member of the Stan West Band . <p> i had Tom and Dave play at my wedding on Saturday , and I think that the whole band showed up at the party at La Vida on Sunday . I think that we had members from about 10 different bands that day . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the hollow , and he played in my band for a few years before I moved to Colorado and lost track of everyone . <p> Carole Caddick <p> I met my husband , Lorne , when he was living in Carbon Canyon . I believe he had a very good friend , Bill Johnson . The Bill I remember meeting once had a dog with a heart condition that would pass out when overly excited . If that is you Bill please get in touch . We live in Summit Ranch now . Lorne would love to hear from you . <p> Bill Johnson <p> Carol ; <p> Yes that was meactually the Great Dane named " Buddy " ( a harlequin black and white spotted pattern ) belonged to my ex wife Patty Robinsonpoor Buddy was a great dog . It went everywhere with her and she never , ever had to worry about someone bothering her . Buddy was very protective ; but alas Buddy died several years ago . She was only 5 yrs old . <p> Pam <p> Came across this blog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house in the hollow one which I would never sell . It is not much by todays standards but the first my mom and I could afford . At one time we owned the Carbon Canyon Inn , known previously as Icabods and then after , Joe Tatars Oak Grove Inn . <p> My fondest memory was the year we shut down Carbon Canyon Road on Halloween and Joel Norris and Clarence reenacted the Ride of the Headless Horseman , it was a sight . I also recall the vigilantes which were mostly Clarence and his shotgun scaring the OC kids who went to the Staley Ranch ( Lions Head nicknamed by the large lions heads at the gate ) . He lived in the house at the gate entrance and would enjoy scaring the school kids when they went to hunt the man-chasing motorcyle-eating monters that lived behind the gates . <p> We were also members of Club El Circulo ( spelling is probably wrong ) which later became the Purple Haze . It was a great place to go on the weekends and largely supported in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chris Cromwell was my neighbor for a time and we both drove VW crewcab pickupstimes in the canyon are ones you will never forget and the stories seem to stay with you to share generations down . <p> I do not know anyone who has ever told me it was a bad place to live . It is not for everyone but in the 70s it seemed Off beat Professionals , Hippies and Cowboys brought a lot of color to a very small townOne of those places that if the streets could talk what stories they would tell . <p> Bill Johnson <p> The name of the second store was , or at least we all called it , " Freds Store . " It was a one-room general store owned and operated by Fred Gentry who lived there with his wife who was suffering from muscular sclerosis . <p> Freds store offered credit to the locals . I always shopped there because it was easier than driving out of the canyon for supplies . In fact rumor has it that Freds store was a converted bar , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me where there were bullet holes left in the ceiling and walls , remnants of an arguement that had gotten out of hand in days gone by . <p> The Purple Haze was a great place to party , full of a collection of the most delicious variety of neer-do-wells and other eccentrics you could ever meet . <p> charlie link <p> Cool stories about this place . When I was in my late teens I watched bands play at La Vida roadhouse and even enjoyed that $1 spaghetti night every week = <p> I was always interested in seeing what the hotel looked like and one day even hopped the fence with my buddies and went into it . There was a large hole in the roof where a fire burned thru , I imagine some homeless person was living in there and made a fire to keep warm and it got out of control or someone was making speed or something . <p> Anyhow yeah it was weird , there were boxes of hotel records all over the floor in the office area downstairs and the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the basement but we were all too chicken . <p> The pool area was awesome , there was a kids pool it seemed and a really large other pool , I remember the swinging gym thing , my friend got in it and we actually used it LOL . I took pictures of it and of the pool area and have them somewhere . Its really too bad that this place was not saved . I think someone should buy the property its on and rebuild a new one , a replica of the original . Anyhow . Thanks . <p> Vic Murray <p> I left an earlier comment about a photograph of a La Vida ad that was hanging in the restaurant many years ago . The older kids in my family were pictured drinking La Vida Water , and the photo title read : La Vida Babies . <p> I did n't  know what had become of our copy of the photo , but I visited my cousin , Evelyn , a few days ago , and found that she had saved one and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and think that it would be nice to post it on a La Vida website . I could just post it on Facebook , I suppose . The picture was taken in about 1931 , and my brother and sister and our cousins were all smiling , but I understand that the mineral water was n't so tasty . <p> Joel Billeaudeaux <p> My brother and I really enjoyed all of these stories and memories of this wonderful place . We are Canyonites being born and raised in Olinda Village and attending Olinda school . I had so much fun as a young man at La Vida in the early 90s Saw great bands and always had fun and yes the Vagos kept us little punks in line when we got out of hand . My friend Martin Johnson worked as a cook there in the late 90s and I filled in for him a couple of times . The back of the restaurant was directly over the creek and I believe you could see through the floor . La Vida was our last stop of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the feeling of Fall in the Canyon and will cherish my time there . 1974 to 1998 . <p> Martin S. Johnson <p> Don Himes ran La Vida for many years until his passing and the end of an era in 2001 . I worked as a bouncer , cook , and booked alot of the bands that played there from 98 until it closed . I will always have a special place in my heart for all the employees , patrons , bikers , and local freaks that I had the privilege to associate with . <p> Bill Duke <p> I happaned to stumble across this blog in pursuing a different matter .

He opened a few other theme restaurants in the area as well , with other North Woods Inns in La Mirada and San Gabriel and a Steak n Stein in Pico Rivera still under the same ownership . He was also responsible for- Rancho Cucamongas Magic Lamp . LA Weekly wrote a nice history of them all . <p> Friends and I used to eat at Covinas North Woods Inn near Christmas every year , but we stopped , after one friend , incensed that his steak and shrimp dinner did n't  have the number or size of shrimp he was envisioning , put the kibosh on returning . I 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday . ( He did n't  attend . ) I had the idea after revisiting Covina Bowl and realizing it was a block west of North Woods . A two-in-one birthday opportunity had presented itself . <p> We were there for a mid-afternoon Sunday lunch . While you wait for a table , you can sit around the center fireplace or take in the surroundings , which include a stuffed bear under glass . Soon we were seated , at a table that appeared hewn from a log , with a gas lamp on it . The staff all wear red vests . Its charming to a high degree . <p> The meat-focused menu- is mostly steak and seafood dinners , with a few sandwiches thrown in too , and is n't for vegetarians or light eaters. - We had a 9-ounce lumberjack steak ( $32 ) , filet mignon ( $37 ) , chicken ( $23 ) and the North Woods Special Platter ( $31 ) , which came with fish , steak and fried chicken . All dinners are accompanied by red cabbage and caesar salads ( I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus rice pilaf and baked potato . <p> We all liked our food . It was n't spectacular , but it was good enough . Two small criticisms : Dinners come with potato AND rice ? That 's a little starchy . And the mushroom gravy , which I opted for with my potato , was disappointing rather than a treat . <p> If you have n't been to North Woods , you should probably go at least once . Its one of the most unique restaurants in the region and well worth a drive from the Inland Valley . <p> After our three-hour lunch , my friends felt pressed to get back home , so I went bowling on my own . I bowled one game , for a score of 174 , my third-highest ever ! Thanks , Covina . <p> I know of this place , and have heard raves about it . I even drive by it .

Hey , Upland to Covina is n't that hard its not like driving to Santa Monica . <p> Tom S <p> David If you ever get to Aldonios , make sure you get informed on the history of the restaurant . Aldonio worked in a pizza restaurant in Hollywood , and he appeared in the old I Love Lucy TV show in the 1950s as a pizza maker . It has been a long time since I have seen the episode , but know it is a classic . He went on to open the restaurant on the border of Covina and Azusa ( offically Azusa btw ) . When I started going there in the late 1970s he had sold it to his son , but still worked part time in the kitchen . In the late 1980s the son sold it and it went thru a series of owners who basically left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current owner bought it I would guess around 2000 , and created the current menu , getting away from being a pizza place . The above comments are right , the daily specials , as well as their salad specials are very good , and modestly priced . It is located on the northwest corner of Hollenbeck-Cerritos Ave and Arrow Hwy where Covina and Azusa meet . It is in what many have called a " ghetto strip mall " , but I have never had a problem there . Also Gabriel is a great person . <p> melanie <p> FYI.The salad is a blue cheese dressing and not a caesar dressing . = 20357 @qwx640357 <p> You 're right . <p> DebB <p> Wasnt it North Woods that put out bowls of peanuts , and had you toss the shells on the floor ? 20357 @qwx640357 <p> Yes ! <p> Paul Ochsner <p> I worked there one night in 67 or 68 , and made up my mind I did n't  want to be a bus boy and dishwasher .

MANY decades later he still works for the Clearmans as manager of Clermans Galley ( the Boat ) in the same center as the San Gabriel Northwoods , the original . The Galley has the same salads and cheese bread , but is more or a sports bar with burgers and sandwiches instead of steaks . <p> Yes the green salad is blue cheese and iceberg lettuce , hardly caesar . When they rebuilt the boat , I was asked if I would design some ships wheel art that they could put in the middle of the rough-hewn tables , similar to those at the " Woods " and they were also printed by a local Pomona printer . So we have a connection there . My artwork was eventually also used on their cups , napkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I can usually get a lunch when I visit . <p> Also , the Covina version was originally a Dinnerhorn restaurant in the 50s . That was one of my parents favorite spots . I know that another Dinnerhorn , in Pomona , became Robbies , which you 've written about on several occasions . 20357 @qwx640357 <p> Thanks for all that , John .

That 's because Imperial Sushi , reflecting the demographic , is Mexican-run and Mexican-focused .

Americans are notorious for adapting foreign cuisines to their taste . This includes Mexican food , Chinese food and Japanese food .

@@73755477 @2455477/ <p> here 's how ESBC describes how their newest IPAs were created ; they look like a tasty addition to what is usually the countys best line-up of big West Coast IPAs : <p> Traditionally beers are bittered by adding relatively small amounts of hop at the beginning of the boil this results in the firm bitterness that IPA fiends have come to love . A somewhat newer approach often referred to as " bursting " employs the technique of adding huge amounts of hops very late in the boil , or even after the kettle has been turned off . The large volume gives ample bitterness and the added bonus of MASSIVE flavor components . This series is all about exploring what each hop adds to both the bitterness and the flavor of the beer when employed only in late additions with no early additions . The malt bill will remain consistent throughout the series , and we promise you .. it wo n't get in the way .

Years later , when the property was sold , the Star was still expected to shine and it has . <p> Ken Petschow and the San Antonio Heights Association were diligent in making sure the Star was lit when the property was in foreclosure ; Ken later purchased the property , inheriting the Star , in 1996 . <p> Over the years , the Star has been blown down , burned to a melted pile of aluminum and even stolen by thieves ( who apparently wanted to Star all to themselves ) . <p> In addition to the light and joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a symbolic beacon of patriotism and hope at various times in the recent past . <p> The Star was shining bright following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 and was lit as a final act of defiance against the onrushing Grand Prix fire on October 25 , 2003 .

The Glendora location turns out to be the closest freestanding Fosters to the Inland Valley . <p> On a recent hot Sunday afternoon , Fosters came to mind and I made the drive . The low-slung building with the covered patio and walk-up window seems very 1960s . ( Employees had no idea when it opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Next door is an Alta Dena Dairy with an awesome sign . <p> As Fosters has a small dining room , and air conditioning was desirable , I ordered and ate inside : a small hamburger and a pineapple shake ( $7.56 total with tax ) . It was a decent burger with a crunchy sheaf of lettuce , and the shake hit the spot . In an unusual touch , a wall-sized chalkboard allows customers to scrawl a friendly message . I 'd have taken a photo but someone was sitting in front of it in the otherwise-empty room . <p> If you like this sort of thing , by all means check out Fosters . I 'm sure I 'll go back . <p> As a kid in Pomona in the late 1940s , Mom and I would walk around the corner and across Towne Ave . to the Fosters on Mission once a week for an ice cream treat . <p> Thanks for the memories . <p> Dara Allen <p> Your picture of the luscious Fosters Freeze treat actually made my mouth water !

( Hans Gutknecht/Staff ) <p> ESPN caused a bit of a stir Saturday when Adam Schefter reported that the Rams were " trying and expecting " to extend the contracts of head coach Jeff Fisher and general manager Les Snead before the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers . <p> The information is fairly consistent with what we 've been hearing for most of the last few months there is an appetite to get deals done for both Fisher and Snead , who are both in the final year of their five-year contracts . <p> And while there is no timetable in place to get both locked up , there is hope it will happen before the start of the season . <p> With three weeks remaining before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . <p> And as Fisher told me at the start of training camp : " I 'm going to be the coach here a long time . " <p> That does n't  mean a deal is imminent . But with all sides open to extending the relationship , there is a clear path to an agreement . With those dynamics in place , things usually get done . <p> While the timing might seem a bit odd to Rams fans if not premature considering the Rams 26-31 record under Fisher and Sneads leadership the last four seasons its reflective of the confidence the organization has in the current direction . <p> That might not sit well with fans itching for a change , but it does make sense . <p> In a vacuum , there is no defending the 26-31 record . It speaks for itself and is unacceptable . <p> But with a little bit of context and perspective , you can make the case the Rams are in much better shape today than they were the day Snead and Fisher arrived . Keep in mind , the Rams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the five-year walk up to Fisher and Snead coming aboard . That is n't just bad , its historically and epically atrocious . <p> All of a sudden 26-31 does n't  look so bad considering the 15-65 record that preceded it . <p> The roster , which was in shambles when they arrived , is younger and better at nearly every position and features the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year ( Todd Gurley ) and the 2014 Defensive Rookie of the Year in Aaron Donald . And by moving up from the 15th spot in the first round of last Aprils draft to the No. 1 pick , the Rams added what they hope is their franchise quarterback in Cals Jared Goff . <p> Yes , they have been unable to draft and develop and legitimate No. 1 receiver and until further notice like a step in the right direction in 2016 the offensive line is still unsettled . <p> But it would be disingenuous not to acknowledge the widespread improvement of the roster the last four years . <p> Point is , thanks largely to the drafting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One that , with even just a moderate bump up in quarterback play , could easily make the turn from the 7-9 teams theyve been recently to a 9-7 , 10-6 team . <p> After building the foundation then adding the rookie quarterback they believe will eventually put the Rams over the top a strong case can be made that Fisher and Snead deserve a chance to see the massive reconstruction job through its conclusion . <p> That does n't  even account for the message it would send or the drama it would create if the Rams sent Fisher and Snead into 2016 as lame ducks on top of the drama and distractions created by the cross-country move from St. Louis , their first season back in Los Angeles and nurturing a rookie quarterback . <p> Knowing a little bit about the media like I do , I can pretty much assure weekly shade being thrown on Fisher and Sneads long-term status with the Rams if they 're dangling by a string all season . And it wont just be the media talking about it , either . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . <p> Is that a distraction the Rams really want to subject themselves to in a season that will be full of them ? <p> Especially when they can eliminate it by giving Fisher and Snead security beyond this season ? <p> Stability comes at a price sometimes , and in this case the value in creating it is worth the money it will cost them . <p> If the Rams go belly up in 2016 , they can always cut Fisher or Snead or both loose and go in another direction . Theyd have to eat dead money , but Stan Kroenkes deep pockets can easily afford it . <p> On the other hand , if a young , talented roster continues to ascend and Goff turns out to be the quarterback the Rams believe he can be , Fisher and Snead will be the undisputed architects of quite the turnaround .

This is simply a restaurant , one where you order at the counter , in a fairly ordinary neighborhood , even though there must be golf nearby . Its not in the shopping center on the corner of Soquel Canyon Parkway but in a small complex north of there . <p> With that out of the way : Lettuce Toss It , a pun business name of which I approve , is one of the few places in these parts that specializes in salads . I had lunch there recently with two friends . <p> There are 16 pre-designed salads , some of which sounded good to me ; I almost opted for the Strawberry Sweetness before deciding to go for the Toss It Your Way , in which you pick the lettuce , six toppings and a dressing ( $8.50 ) . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnuts , raspberries , oranges , pineapple , strawberries and sun-dried tomatoes , topped with raspberry vinaigrette . ( This was my attempt to recreate the Panera summer salad I like . ) Very good , and very colorful , although the sun-dried tomatoes , as I suspected at the time , did n't  really go with the salad as composed . <p> A friend also built her own salad : spinach , green and black olives , tomatoes and green peppers , adding grilled tofu ( $1.50 ) and avocado ( $1.25 ) . " I really outdid myself , " she bragged . The vegetarian had been here twice previously and liked her salad . <p> The third got a salad-sandwich combo : half a JJs Ham and Swiss ( plus sourdough , mustard and romaine ) and the half Cobbler Gobbler Salad ( turkey , bacon bits , cheese , tomato , romaine , egg and avocado ) .

And quesadillas . And cookies ( 3 for $1.50 ) : We had the chocolate chip , three of them , and enjoyed them . <p> We all liked the place , which opened a couple of years ago and is popular enough to have expanded into the vacant storefront next door , vastly increasing the seating capacity .

In the Village there 's Bert and Rockys ( traditional ice cream ) , A La Minute ( nitrogen ice cream ) , 21 Choices and Yogurtland ( frozen yogurt ) , with another 21 Choices and a Baskin Robbins near each other on Foothill . And now there 's Snow Station . <p> Formerly a Verizon store , and then Pie St. pizza , this little shop is at the south end of what we might call the American Apparel building . Blink and you 'll miss it . Snow Station appears to be winning the battle despite its location . <p> Its a franchise of a slightly different concept , a vegan ice cream parlor , although its not billing itself that way . The offerings are described as a blend of ice cream and frozen yogurt , both non-dairy because soy milk is used . " No longer do vegans and lactose intolerant individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yogurt , " the back of the menu reads . The result is said to be lighter in calories , which I can believe , because its not dense . <p> Flavors and toppings are reminiscent of Yogurtland . <p> There are three sizes : mini ( $4 ) , baby ( $6 ) and hungry ( $8 ) . My first visit was with a friend , and we each got the mini size , which looks like the kind of cup in which youd get two scoops . For that price you get your choice of ice cream , topping and drizzle . I went with peanut butter , bananas and honey ; my friend got raspberry , Heath bar and nothing . ( She was a fizzle on drizzle . ) <p> What you get is snowy , almost like shaved ice , snow with milk or homemade ice cream from the days when you churned it yourself .

One of them said , " Its like they took a snow cone and made it good ! " The texture is perfect , I thought . One had coffee + oreos +chocolate drizzle and the other had the plain mint , nothing on it . The mint is truly minty , and the cashier said they make the coffee snow with real brewed coffee .

Through the expanse of floor-to-ceiling windows , the sidewalk is just steps away . Cyclists rode past . Pedestrians walked dogs or pushed shopping carts . Cars whizzed by .

Both were family operations launched in 1937 , serving Cal-Mex food , although Mitla has the distinction that its cooks taught Glen Bell how to make hardshell tacos , a skill he eventually parlayed into Taco Bell . <p> Mitla also has the distinction of remaining in business ; Ramons closed in 2013 , shortly before its founder , Ramon Sanchez , died . Descendants of founders Vicente and Lucia Montano still operate Mitla , which is now the oldest Mexican restaurant in the Inland Empire , and among the oldest in Southern California . <p> Rarely do I head east , but in July I had to go to Redlands , and on my way back I eschewed eateries in that burg to go to Mitla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only blocks from the 215 , in the West Side barrio . <p> Mitla occupies what appears to be its original building and once inside , past the glass bricks in the entry , you 'll take in the front room with its counter , swivel seats and vintage Mitla calendars , and feel like you 've stepped back in time . <p> That first visit , I ate in the dining room and got the No. 6 dinner ( $8.75 ) , with a taco , enchilada and chile relleno , a kind of sampler platter .

This time I sat at the counter and got the three-taco combination , ground rather than shredded beef ( $7.25 ) , and got to marvel at them anew . <p> To be clear , there is nothing cutting edge about this food , and the menu even has a section I believe was called " American Tastes , " with hamburgers and hot dogs . Mitla is almost a classic coffee shop , only a Mexican-American version , where you can get fries with your huevos rancheros .

@@73755817 @2455817/ <h> Restaurant of the Week : Lucilles BBQ <p> Lucilles , a barbecue chain , was one of the original tenants when Victoria Gardens opened in 2004 . And its still there , while adding a location in Chino Hills . Did you know the Signal Hill-based chain is owned by the same people behind the coffee shop chain Hofs Hut ? The gauzy story on the Lucilles website about its origins under " Lucille Buchanan " is actually fiction , as the company admits . Ha ha ! <p> I do n't  feature chains here very often , but when there 's only one or two local locations , I 'll do it . In this case , a group of friends was celebrating a couple of birthdays recently at the VG , so I was there anyway . It was a Saturday night and the place was jammed . <p> Lucilles is colorful and corporate-kitschy , with neon signs outside and quaint-looking advertising-type signs inside : " Good choices : FDR &amp; BBQ , " " Was one mint julep the cause of it all ?

The menu has barbecue , Southern specialties , sandwiches and salads . <p> That night I had a decent half-rack of St. Louis ribs ( $24 , below ) and two sides : cheesy grits , boring , and collard greens , surprisingly good . When you 're done , they give you a hot towel , like at a Japanese restaurant , and that 's a nice touch , and better than Wet-Naps , for cleaning sauce off your hands . <p> I went back for lunch a few days later to try something else , getting a pulled pork sandwich ( $12 , below ) with more of those greens . It was a meaty sandwich and I ate some of the pork with a knife and fork . This was a good choice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they have a band every night playing blues .

Its a cartoon version of the South , sure . But so what ?

@@73755818 @2455818/ <h> At the movies with Vernor Rodgers <h> Main menu 20354 @qwx640354 <h> Dracula Untold revisits the most famous vampire of them all <p> Vampire stories have become so prevalent in the horror movie genre , right up there with zombies , that it was inevitable the top blood-sucker of them all , Dracula , would be revisited . <p> Gary Shore , who has directed commercials for popular brands of products , along with the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless , have put together as their first major major feature the movie " Dracula Untold . " Unlike previous Dracula films wherein the vampire has been around and fed off the blood of humans for centuries , " Untold " focuses on how this person became a vampire in the first place . <p> The notion that author Bram Stoker based Dracula on Vlad III of Transylvania also know as Vlad the Impaler has been speculative . There is a passage in chapter three of the " Dracula " novel that makes references to the dark times in which Vlad lived , and later Draculas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that era . <p> Shore , Sazama and Sharpless build upon that speculation and portray Vlad / Dracula as a more sympathetic character than history has . <p> In the 1400s , the Turks were the conquerors of territories and exploited Transylvania by claiming 1,000 of the countrys boys , enslaving them and training them to become killers for their army . Among those taken by the Turks was Vlad , who would grow up and become the feared and legendary Vlad the Impaler . <p> As an adult , Vlad ( Luke Evans ) has returned to the Castle Dracula and is a beloved prince in his homeland Transylvania . There has been a fragile peace with the Turks and it is a time of prosperity . <p> While out patrolling in the wilderness near the castle , Vlad and some of his soldiers come across a Turkish helmet . Fearing the Turks are sending out spies , they investigate and end up inside a cave on Broken Tooth Mountain . There they tragically encounter some sort of savage being . The shaken Vlad returns home and soon learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found in that cave was a man who had made a pact with a demon that of course betrayed him , leaving this man cursed to living in the dank cave for eternity as a vampire . <p> Shortly thereafter , Transylvanias Easter festivities are interrupted by messengers for the latest Turk Sultan , Mehmed ( Dominic Cooper ) , who announce that the ruler is renewing the decree that Translyvania give up 1,000 of its boys to be trained for the Turkish army . This order also includes Vlads son Ingeras ( Art Parkinson ) . Since Vlad and Mehmed grew up together , the prince believes he can talk his old childhood buddy out of this ruling . <p> But Mehmed ( Cooper at his strutting , villainy best ) brushes off any alternative proposal by Vlad , even insisting that Vlad can always have another son , replacing the one he will be giving up . <p> Vlad barely gets home when a half-dozen Turks arrive to claim Ingeras . In addition , they foolishly taunt Vlad , a fatal mistake . <p> Knowing that Mehmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be able to repel , the desperate Vlad returns to Broken Tooth Mountain in hopes of harnessing some of that power from the cursed vampire residing in the cave . <p> The- vampire is played by Charles Dance , and he sees this as an opportunity . If he can pass on his vampire curse to Vlad , he will be free to escape the cave and carry out revenge on his betrayer . Vlad must drink some of the vampires blood , which will give him enormous power , but only for three days . However , if Vlad succumbs to the what will be a ravenous appetite for blood in those three days , he will become a vampire for eternity . <p> " Dracula Untold " now presents the challenge of whether Vlad can defeat the Turks in three days and whether he can resist the temptation of drinking blood . Also , Vlad needs to stay out of the sun . <p> Evans , who was the lethally calculating Driver in the 2012 blood-fest " No One Lives , " presents Vlad as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra violent past and now savors the peaceful life with his wife Merina ( Sarah Gadon ) and son . He is a strong and wise leader of his people . Backed into a corner , he must risk it all to save his people from an unyielding force . Evans has a commanding screen presence and adequately conveys a man tormented by the forces that lead him to making such perilous decisions . <p> " Dracula Untold " is beautifully shot among a dark and foreboding backdrop . Unfortunately , - the battle scenes are choppy and hard to follow . It is earnest in its presentation , and aside from Vlad , Merina , Ingeras and the Vampre , the supporting characters are basically scenery with little to make them memorable . <p> The movies ending also points to this being a reboot of the Dracula franchise .

Under the guidance of director James Mangold , who has shown his skills in presenting drama ( " Walk the Line , " " Girl , Interrupted " ) , writers Mark Bomback ( " Live Free or Die Hard " ) and Scott Frank ( " Marley and Me , " " Minority Report , " and screen adaptations of Elmore Leonards " Get Shorty " and " Out of Sight " ) , " The Wolverine " is a balanced blend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular Wolverine stories from the comic version , landing Logan in Japan where there is plenty of peril and need for his mutant talents . <p> In an opening flashback , Logans earlier visit to Japan found him imprisoned outside of Nagasaki in the late days of World War II . When the second atom bomb is dropped on this city , Logan saves the life of a young Japanese soldier , Yashida . <p> Decades later , Logan is living a hermit life in the wilderness , still haunted by the death of his beloved Jean Grey ( Famke Janssen ) , who dominates his dreams , while he drifts along with no sense of purpose . His only trips to civilization are to buy batteries for an old clock radio . When his peaceful co-existence with a grizzly bear is savagely terminated , he heads into town and the bar therein where the culprits are drinking . He is in clean-out-the-bar mode , a la Steve Seagal , but before its gets too nasty , a young Japanese lady intervenes . She is Yukio ( Rila Fukushima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan that his old friend Yashida , who founded the huge corporation named after him , is gravely i 'll and wants Logan to come to Japan and say goodby . <p> That turns out to be a ruse , as Yashida really wants to offer Logan a chance at mortality . Calling eternal life on Earth a curse , Yashida claims that with chemists in tow he has an ability to undo the mutant factors in Logan so that he can grow old but live a normal life . <p> Logan is skeptical but also suspicious of what is going on around Yashida . First there is the lady doctor/biochemist ( Svetlana Khodchenkova ) who just has that look of not being who she claims to be . There are family tensions , as Yashidas son Shingen ( Hiroyuki Sanada ) clearly is not favored by his father , who instead sees Shingens daughter Mariko ( Tao Okamota ) as the more worthy heir . Add to this that the Yashida empire is the target of Yakuzas and ninjas and corruption within the Japan government , you have the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrestles with his sorrow , guilt and sense of worth . <p> The action picks up at the funeral of Yashida , where an attempt to kidnap Mariko is foiled by Logan , Yukio and others . Once Logan and Mariko find temporary sanctuary , the Wolverine tries to untangle all these factors with the Yashidas and their foes . His red flags over the biochemist prove to be dead on . <p> There are calm moments in " The Wolverine " that give Logan a chance to reassess his life while also finding that Mariko , at first a seemingly frail young woman , proves to have an inner strength that appeals to Logan . <p> Jackmans take on Wolverine in this movie is much more somber than previous outings . Yes , he still has not come to terms with his mutant gifts , but in " The Wolverine " he displays much more despair and little humor . But his humanity gets a workout , particularly in his growing affection for Mariko played with understated style by Okamoto in her first movie role .

I now wonder who on the parks commission thought of putting that and the smaller sea turtles there . <p> Across from Lincoln School was the Melody Pet Store , where the owners at the time had an ocelot in the store . We 'd go down there just to see that . Then there was Heidis Toy store , which if I recall , had a big slot car track , where enthusiasts could race . <p> All this reminiscing is making me hungry . I sure could go for a hot turkey sandwich from the Heritage House . Or the world famous Chicken in the Rough from the aforementioned Henrys . Finish it off with a Valley Forge from the Betsy Ross . Just imagine how many more lunch places you could go to David if some of these were still around . I 'm guessing the century mark would be toast in 08 . <p> Jim <p> Makes me wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim . DA <p> Greg Orman <p> Though Ive only been in the area for a little over 20 years , reading all these comments has been great . And I even remember a few of the places mentioned . <p> One of the things I miss is a relatively recent loss . I love the old field stone buildings that dot the area , and some of the few still occupied during my time here were the homes and outbuildings on the northeast corner of Central Ave and Arrow Rte ( not Arrow Hwy ! ) in Upland . Now those buildings and their orchards are gone , replaced by a generic suburban apartment complex . <p> Of course change is constant and progress is necessary , but here 's to hoping we do n't  remove all traces of the valleys past and character in the process . <p> Carla <p> How about La Piccoletta in Claremont ? It was owned by an Italian woman named Linda for over 25 years . You always knew you were going to get a great dish of pasta because she was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pasta I have eaten in Italy . No excuses just incredible food . <p> The restaurant is still there with the same name but she sold it a few years ago and her great food is just a memory now . It was one of lifes great pleasures <p> Sad to say I have n't been there . I kind of forget its there , and then you ca n't look inside and that intimidates me a bit . Maybe I 'll hit it this year . DA <p> Carla <p> Well David it still has the name La Piccoletta and it is still a unique cozy place but the great pasta left the building when Linda did . <p> Scott <p> How about Lomitas golf course where the embattled Wal-Mart will soon be ? <p> Does anyone remember the ping-pong ball drops that used to be held in the old parking lot behind the then-Thrifty on Fourth st ? Market Basket and Woolworths in the same plaza where Albertsons is . <p> here 's one that a handful of you may remember : On Fifth and Monte Vista there was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old train there now . ) The man who lived at that old house used to sell eggs door to door . He was a very nice old Austrian man who smoked a pipe named Mr. Ollerman . <p> Milk delivery from Scott Bros dairy . The Helms truck . How about the old split-level JC Penneys down on Euclid . One more for now . The old Millers Outpost on I think B and Euclid . It too was a split level and I remember getting school clothes there . <p> Now why did n't  anyone think of putting a golf course back at Fifth and Mountain instead of a Wal-Mart ? DA <p> Scott <p> OReillys on Holt just east of Mountain . Charbroiled burgers ( unusual for the time ) , and a sundae bar where you made your own sundae . Family owned . The Paint Bucket is there now . <p> In about 1966 there was an old fashioned soda fountain shop in the strip mall where the 99 Cent Store is on Mountain and B. It was good but did n't  catch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Henrys in Pomona , do n't  forget Burger Lane in Ontario , it was another hang-out for the Chaffey kids . Does anyone remember Edwards Ranch House on Mission , I believe it would have been in Montclair today . Best chicken dinners around ( of course they only featured Chicken Dinners ) , sort of a local Knotts Berry . <p> Incidentally , Burger Lane is now Sammys Burger , about which you can read here in a late December " Restaurant of the Week " account . DA <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear David , <p> Wow ! What a column you have written ! I sure hope it inspires more people to write in and reflect on " What 's not here anymore . " <p> While reading through all the posts , I could not help but shed a tear or two at all the places mentioned that I have missed dearly . <p> I would like to share my experiences of growing up in the I.E. for all of my 45 years . Why , I remember the days of going to department stores such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Costco ) Home Club ? Builders Emporium , just to name a few . <p> On the restaurant side , there is a whole slew of places worth a mention . The Jolly Roger , The Arbor Inn , Alphies ( now a Dennys at Foothill Blvd and San Antonio Ave . ) , Betsy Ross , and of corse , who could forget Ferrells Ice Cream Parlor , that sat in the northwest corner of the Montclair Plaza parking lot ? The Thunderbird Lanes Coffee Shop ? ( I apologize , for the name of it escapes me ) . <p> On the entertainment side , a few of the places I can remember , is the Mountain Green theater in the Mervyns plaza in Upland . It was a small , dainty theater boasting only 4 screens . Then there was the go-cart race track at the southwest corner of 7th Steet and Benson Ave . One could drive a motorized go-cart around a track filled with all kinds of twists and turns , and be timed driving it . <p> I , too , also remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( behind the plaza ) , then later added five more in the rear which is now hosts a 24-hour fitness center . Who can remember the Montclair Tri-plex on Holt Blvd ? which later became the Five-plex ? I can remember going there and seeing the " Rocky Horror Picture Show " at the midnight showings more times than I care to mention , and then going to Michael Js Restaurant afterwards . <p> But the one place that has always had the biggest effect on me being now gone , is the A&amp;W Drive-In . Situated near the corner of Holt Blvd and Mountain Ave in Ontario , one could still pull up , order a meal , and eat it in their vehicle . Even at the time before its demise , gone were the days where the waitresses wore roller skates . <p> In closing , its like what everyone else is saying , that its all a part of change . I 'm sure in 10 years or so , we might be reflecting on what used to be Starbucks , Target , Best Buy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may or may not like change . Its progress that ca n't be stopped . <p> Incidentally , Tad , that restaurant that used to sit in front of the clock tower in the Montclair Plaza was a Bobs Big Boy = <p> Randall , thanks to adding to our roll call of past pleasures . Glad you enjoyed this blog thread so much . The ability for people to add comments really makes this the perfect venue for this type of reminiscence , does n't  it ? DA <p> David <p> I moved to the Pomona valley 30 years ago but moved away in 2003 . Some restaurants that I miss are the Crystal Cafeteria , Breakfast at Carls , The Montclair Peanut Co. and Olivers on Foothill Blvd. in Upland . The west side of Pomona used to have so much hustle and bustle when General Dynamics was in business . I miss Buffums , Nashs and getting blue chip stamps at Stater Bros . <p> gina <p> I remember the Holiday skating rink in Montclair that is where the McDonalds is now . Then there was the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar on my leg from falling off the burlap sack . Also the restaurant that was in the now Target parking lot . It had a giant windmill and I think that it was called the Hollander ? ? ? <p> The Hollander Cafeteria , I think . DA <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear David , <p> I find myself here once again , ready to add more to the nostalgic list of places " no longer there . " <p> While I was growing up , I started working for a restaurant called Mr. Steak . Located near the corner of Foothill Blvd. &amp; Mountain Ave . in Upland ( talk about a blast from the past ) for 3 to 4 years before it went under . <p> After that , I worked odd jobs between here and there , til I landed a job at General Dynamics in Pomona . I worked there for nearly 5 years and met a slew of wonderful people , whom I wished I kept in contact with but did n't  . <p> I , too , remember Market Basket in Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time so he could get his peppermints : ) . <p> During my years of attending Upland High School , my brother and I use to short-cut across the field that was next to the school . At that time , we enjoyed ourselves at James Games , had a large yogurt at That Yogurt Place , and if we had time , stopped in at the Wherehouse Records . <p> These were some of my fondest memories growing up , and I 'm sure I 'll be back writing some more = <p> Danny Mac <p> Those were the days , my friends , I 'd thought they never endI just witnessed the demolition of the " Boys " Market on Indian Hill ( Alexander in the 50s ) and Holt last week . My Dad grew up across the street before Sears was there in a orange grove home . The store had the big column sticking up in the sky with " Boys " in neon . I had one of my first jobs there as a butchers assistant in the meat dept . I graduated to another famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served banana splits and ran the Zoo up and down the aisle . Thank you all for the good memories . <p> Bruce N. Wheelock <p> Oh , I remember that Boys Market ! I used to work in the Sears auto shop behind the Sears store in the shopping mall across the street . Was working there on August 30 , 1972 , the day my son was born . <p> My father-in-law , " Mac " McKnight , and his family moved to Pomona in the late 60s , after he was hired as controller of that Sears store ; he had been promoted to controller of the Boyle St. store in Los Angeles shortly before I met Sue . So it was thanks to Sears that I got to find her ( we met in the Drama Department at Pomona High School ) . <p> I also recall a Standard Brands paint store diagonally across from that shopping mall , and I think there was also a separate large hardware store very close to it , though it is possible that was also just part of Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the side street , was the military recruiting office where I enlisted in the Navy in the autumn of 1972 . <p> judi <p> I grew up primarily in Montclair , and I held part-time jobs in different businesses to put myself through college . This column made me wonder if I might be the Kiss of Death employee , as they are now all gone : <p> Hickory Farms in the Montclair Plaza ( I stood at the door and offered samples of their Beef Stick : " Its 100% beef , no pork , garlic , or pepper , its smoked so its good for backpacking , hiking , or camping " ) , A&amp;M Bakery and The California Fit in the K-Mart shopping strip , The Montclair Cinemas 1 &amp; 2 ( Imagine , two choices for films at one location ! ) , The Lace Place , a tiny little store in a nearly abandoned shopping mall on the corner of White and Foothill in La Verne , and my longest tenure , at Dicks Exxon on the corner of Monte Vista and So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest-to-goodness gas station attendants who actually pumped the gas , washed windows , checked the oil , etc . ( In fact , The Daily Report ran a story and picture about me , as it was unusual for a girl to be employed in such a " male-dominated field . " ) <p> I worked there when gas prices rose to ONE DOLLAR A GALLON ! ! You should have heard the uproar then . Oh , have times changed ! Just think back about a week when we got excited when gas dropped down to $3.07 ! <p> Yes , these places are no more , and I just hope that I was n't somehow responsible for their demise . I do n't  think so , but since I now work from home , I just keep an eye open for any incoming meteor . You never know . <p> Linda <p> Hey ! I 'm back . Someone out there has to remember Rudy Pocks on Euclid in Ontario , where the coolest kids went to listen and buy the coolest records in the 50s , those individual listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-dance dinners at Seapys on Holt in Pomona and The Jade Palace on Holt in Ontario . Those were the days ! ! ! <p> Linda <p> Hi David , The Burger Lane I was writing about was there in the 1950s , a little east of Sammys , just a small little drive-thru where we all met and hung out . Your column is why I buy this paper : ) . <p> Why , thank you , Linda . DA <p> JMac <p> Gina was wondering .. It had a giant windmill and I think that it was called the Hollander ? ? ? Gina and David , that would have been the Van De Kamps coffee shop . i believe a few others popped up in the area around 1967-68 . <p> Well , there was a Hollander Cafeteria , if not there , then somewhere else , because I 've heard the name . About Van de Kamps , there was one in downtown Pomona in the prewar era at Second and Garey , and later there was one on Holt and East End . It later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DA <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear Judi , <p> You mentioned some of the places Ive forgotten about . <p> Another one of my fondest memories of growing up in this area , I do recall a girl working at a gas station adjacent to the the Montclair Plaza on Monte Vista . I saw you a few times there when I pulled in and needed gas . I thought you were really cute , but never got up the courage enough to ask you out . <p> And no , you are not responsible for the places you 've worked at that are now gone . Much like victims of a crime , victims are never at fault . So smile Judi , makes people wonder what you 've been up to = <p> I also remember visiting Best Products ( now where Best Buy is ) , TG&amp;Y . <p> We lived right behind a Safeway near Foothill Blvd. &amp; Euclid Ave. , what would now be called a strip-mall . Back then it was easy for any of us kids to go there on our bikes . Oh how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we would also ride our bikes to Thrifty Drug for their famous Ice Cream = THAT was a treat ! And sometimes we would shop at Coronet . <p> The two places I really miss at that location was a Straw Hat Pizza , and an Old World Delicatessen . <p> Thanks , David , for helping us reminisce . I never thought for a moment that I would miss so much , not until I had written it down . <p> Jim Lee <p> Im surprised nobody has mentioned these long-gone Pomona restaurants Orlandos at Erie and Holt . That was quite restaurant for impressing ones date . Same goes for the St. Charles Grille near Holt and Garey . Further west there was The Pomona Valley Inn which at one time was a nice restaurant and hotel . <p> Bruce N. Wheelock <p> I was so sad when I visited Pomona several years ago and discovered that Orlandos ( Erie and Holt ) was gone . On June 3 , 1972 , I married Susan McKnight at First Baptist Church ( Garey and Holt ) ( Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Orlandos Restaurant . <p> I have a few pictures from our wedding album of the reception itself , and out in the parking lot as we departed . <p> What I wish is that we were closing in on our 43rd anniversary . But she passed away , suddenly and unexpectedly , due to pneumonia , on April 2 , 1989 , five days after her 36th birthday . <p> John Clifford <p> Wow , lots of memories . As I was catching up I suddenly realized why we never stopped to eat at Henrys . Most likely we were on our way to the place we ALWAYS stopped on trips east along Foothill , Griswolds . Up until its demise ( now Buca di Beppo ) it was the place for Swedish Smorgasbord . Of course , dad would n't allow us to buy anything in the gift shop , but we had fun looking . Years later in the mid 70s they were a client of mine as I sold ads for the Old School House complex which the Sandersons had just created around their landmark restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was THE restaurant in Pomona . What about The Brasilia on west Holt , a mid-modern night club and restaurant inspired by the new ( in 1960 ) Brazilian capital city . Its a rehab center now : ( <p> Oh , BTW , that " hillbilly " restaurant someone mentioned was called " Seepees " or " Seapeys " , or something like that and it was n't hillbilly so much as old west , with wagon wheel chandeliers and a covered wagon motif throughout . They served a great chicked fried steak . <p> Duane <p> I remember there being a gas station owned by Dandurand on the corner of Central and Benito where the doughtnut shop is now . It was at the time the only other business in front of the Mayfair Market . <p> There used to be a large fountain where the Montclair City Council chambers now sit . I recall it used to get a regular treatment of soap which resulted in a lot of foam . <p> Just north of the Mayfair used to be Freds T-Bird on San Bernardino . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend that also was a female attendent at Dicks Exxon on Monte Vista . <p> At Monte Vista and Arrow Hwy behind the " NEW " ( at the time ) fire station and south of the water tank were three sets of baseball fields . There also was a nursery at the south end of Montclair Plaza . The Montclair High School Band played at its grand opening ( Mr Ruh most likely was a band member in attendance ) . <p> Where the RV dealer now sits on Benson and Moreno was a Malibu Grand Prix . Before the Mission Drive In became a fourplex , there was a house that the manager and his family lived in along the west side of Ramona . <p> And finally , speaking of houses , there was a very mysterious couple that lived in a house at the NE corner of Monte Vista and Palo Verde . They raised chickens and sold eggs . <p> JMac <p> David , the Hollander Cafeteria was inside the Mall , and the Van De Kamps was a standalone restaurant across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I recall was on Holt &amp; Erie , across from Orlandos . <p> Much like Henrys , the Taco Kitchen holds a fond memory for me . <p> Ramona Fredericks <p> The comment by Pat Wiese about attending Pomona High brought back fond and not so fond memories of the fire which destroyed it in 1956 . I was a junior at the time and our " place " was the A and W Root Beer stand just down the street . Havent had a Momma Burger since . <p> Incidentally , when we returned for our senior year in 1957 to the portable classrooms on the site of PHS , we called it " Charcoal Tech . " <p> Mr. Mendoza of the PUSD board was my teacher in sixth grade at Kauffman Elementary before the termites ate it up . Gosh , I 'm old . <p> here 's to the old days . <p> Ramona Fredericks <p> Steve Julian <p> My dad was a Pomona police officer and went into Seapys at Holt and San Antonio for coffee after Pomona HS burned down . He met my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would ask her out . He never told her whether he won or lost the bet . <p> Someone mentioned Orlandos restaurant at Holt &amp; Erie . My first day of work there in 1975 was Mothers Day . What a madhouse . I nearly quit , but stuck it out until the 4th of July . Espiaus was n't far away on Holt , and within blocks of the S&amp;H Green Stamp Redemption Center . <p> I , too , remember Boys Market , Market Basket and the much smaller Stater Bros at Garey and Alvarado . Across from it was Chicken Delight , which delivered hot dinners stapled inside paper plates . We also shopped at Jenkins market , which is now a U-Haul center and ate at Sir Georges on Garey , which is now a church . <p> A department store that I did n't  read about in previous comments is White Front in Montclair . <p> And who can forget the porpoise fountains along the mall in Pomona , and Kress . Another good store was John P Evans in the Sears complex on Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st , but I was too young to remember the pulley system someone mentioned . <p> Welcome to NPR correspondent and Pomona native Steve Julian ! Loved the Seapys story about your parents . Two corrections : John P. Evans was n't at Sears , unless they had a second store there . It should be noted too that the porpoise fountain is still along Second Street . DA <p> Lois R <p> Betsy Ross was the absolute best . It was THE place to go after the high school football games . I remember getting Dill Pickle ice cream . Anyone else remember that ? <p> Marlene H. <p> Here are a few others : Oles Home Improvement on Mountain just north of the 10 fwy which was on the same block as the Upland DMV . Also , Hamburger Ding-A-Ling on Euclid and I think D Street . I have no recollection of the quality of the food , but calling the kitchen from the phone on your table to place your order was really cool . <p> A few blocks north was Pepes Mexican Food . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th ? Also , Armstrongs Garden Center across the street . I would buy flowers for my Mom on Mothers Day from them every year . <p> Among my keenest regrets in life is that I was n't here when the Inland Valley had a restaurant named House of Pies . DA <p> Sue Anne <p> Hello everyoneI am loving this topic.how about The Leaning Tower of Pizza that had a leaning tower out in front on Euclid Ave years ago ? The pizza was good and the tower was plain old tacky fun . There was also another pizza place the name escapes me that was owned by a local family ( Italian even ) that had a few locationswas it called Romas ? <p> jillymd <p> Both of those restaurants were owned by my maternal grandfather , Lorenzo Ruggeri . Leaning Tower Pizza and Roma Pizzeria ( on central in Montclair ) I posted an old family video on YouTube that has footage of the whole family working at Leaning Tower ( its 1 minute 20 seconds in ) <p> Steve Julian mentioned the John P. Evans storeDavid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not at the Sears center ( that isPomona Valley Center , Indian Hill Village , Indian Hill Mall , Plaza Azteca , and today occupied by the PUSD ) . <p> I think Steve may have been thinking of the Ewarts mens clothing store , as they had a store downtown AND at the Pomona Valley Center on Holt . Although it was not their original location downtown , in my childhood the Ewarts store was on the northwest corner of Second and Thomas ( in the Union Block ) . <p> John P. Evans was an amazing store . I bought my first suit there about 1980 ( nice brown polyester ! ) . Walking into the store was like walking back in time ; the front display windows were of an art deco style , leading to double wood and glass doors ; inside , the floors were maple planks , and the high ceiling was ornately pressed metal ( by that time painted dark brown . ) The west wall was lined with dark oak shelving with glass doors , behind which were displayed dress shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west was the mens shoe department . Behind that was the womens Pendleton department , and at the rear of the rambling store was the boys department . <p> The store had been in business since 1911 at the same location ! It lasted until the early 1980s , when John A. Evans retired . It was in every sense a Pomona landmark . <p> Thanks for the confirmation and added info , Tad . DA <p> Marilyn Varney <p> I liked Greenes Deli in Pomona . Another Greenes was added in Claremont just east of Towne and Foothill by the Stater Bros . My memory of Market Basket in the Pomona Sears Shopping center ( west end ) was two free lobsters courtesy of the Lohman and Barkley Radio Show . Another memory is the local radio station would forecast when the orange grove smudgepots should be set out when the weather got cold . <p> Three places that loom large in my memory : Rosedales Nursery on the corner of Indian Hill and Foothill , excellent perennials and roses , taken over by Armstrongs before its demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of Second and Harvard . In the late 1960s you could still buy a variety of exotic writing papers , leather-bound notebooks , steel nibs and pen holders , inks galore , and fountain pens that were affordable for high schoolers like me ( the Parker 45 was only $5 and had a gold nib ) . <p> The store eventually moved a little down Harvard and changed its name , becoming more like an Office Depot and losing its magic as it did so . <p> Yale Books on Yale Ave . in the sixties , mostly used textbooks and paperbacks , stacks of books high enough to fall on top of you as you perused , but all affordable . <p> From this Claremonter , thanks for dropping by . DA <p> judi <p> Hi David , <p> I realize this blog is n't a place for personal correspondence , but if you could please indulge me ? <p> Dear Randall , <p> Your post both flattered and stunned me . I had a secret admirer way back then ? ! Wow . But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in this thread , that cute girl no longer exists . ( Or as my son at age 6 said when he saw a picture of me at age 19 , " That was you ? Mama , you used to be pretty ! " ) <p> But I thank you for your kind remembrance , and for a brief moment yesterday , I was again that young ( thin ) girl , reeking of petroleum products , with a world full of promises ahead of me , and I did smile . <p> Also , if you had asked me out , I would have been flattered then , too , but I would have had to politely decline . During that time , I was either going steady with a nice boy from high school , or I was dating the sweetest man on the planet who would eventually become my husband , and who has put up with my craziness for almost 30 years now . <p> Again , I thank you for your kind words . <p> Dear Duane , <p> Hi , nice boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! <p> Now , back to David : Your blog is an amazing thing . It educates , entertains , and breaches the time-space continuum . Can you patent this somehow ? <p> If only ! DA <p> Jim Lee <p> Three other Pomona favories that I miss include the greasy spoon Apex Cafe on Garey at Second/Third , Saritas Mexican food on Holt and The Hull House on Mission . <p> A few people have mentioned Seapys which I also remember as a kid especially their treasure chest filled with small toys and trinkets where kids could select and keep a small toy . Great marketing ploy as wed always beg our parents to take us there . <p> Warren <p> Well , having put one post on here does not seem to do justice . Reading the comments has rattled my brain and brought back lots of memories ( even of places still around ) . <p> Yes , Betsy Ross was the place to go after football games . Does anyone remember the air museum on Foothill ? I think it finally moved to the Chino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commute between Long Beach and Upland on the weekends . I used to drive the Pomona freeway when it first opened between Euclid and the 605 . In " those " days you would be lucky to see 5-8 cars on the freeway . I last drove it in 1997 on a vacation and it was a parking lot . <p> Dave , as I told you in an email , I recall the McDonalds in Upland and the stink that was raised about the building and the sign . First McDonalds that I had seen that looked like a square box and a sign on a pole that simply said McDonalds and now you tell me that it has a 50s look and Mr. Speedy on the sign . <p> I grew up in the Foothill Knolls area . Of couse at that time there was nothing above 14th Street . When my parents moved to Upland I think the population was about 15,000 and when I left the population was about 50,000 . <p> I remember when the Montclair Plaza was built one story and one level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends in Victorville suggested going to the Plaza and I wondered Why ? Well , it was multiple parking deck and two levels . Man , this brings back memories . <p> Sue Anne <p> David .. please do n't  let this topic disappearcould you please put it back on the main blog a little longer ? I know everyone has enjoyed it and some people are looking for it right now . Many of us have been in the area all our lives and this has been a great walk down memory lane . Thanks <p> JMac <p> Well we got ta at least get this posting to 50 comments ! <p> The recollections of those regarding long time ( now long gone ) clothing stores , reminded me of what local businesses my family supported throughout my childhood . <p> My father being a local businessman himself , we as a family did most of our buying in the locally run emporiums . Ewarts , JP Evans , Freemans Shoes , Hillens Tvs , et al got the family business . Until the last of them disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they in turn did business with my father . <p> Its a much tougher proposition nowdays , but I try and do my best , to support family-owned businesses . Sure the corporate Big Box stores may save you some $$$ , but for the most part you 're just another number . I like a friendly face who cares and appreciates that I do business with them . <p> Speaking of TVs ( nice segue , eh ? ) , who remembers when all consoles had names to describe the model ? Very regal sounding electronic units like .. " The Barrington " or " The Broxton . " Nowdays its a Sony lcd kdfe60a or something similar . Of course no TV today comes wrapped up in ornate faux cabinetry to deserve such a moniker . <p> Thats 49 DA <p> Steve F. <p> Anyone remember Jans Seafood ? It was located on the NW corner of Towne and Holt on the same lot as the aforementioned " Hillbilly Restaurant . " I think it was called Hillbilly Haven but I cant remember for sure , just remember they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot ! Jans was built later , it was kind of a narrow building that sat on the north end of that lot . <p> Another thing I remember was the old Orange Julius that was across the street from the old Pomona High . A few of us kids ran all the way from Kingsley Elementary down there to watch the old school burn in 1956 . It was the biggest fire Ive ever seen sure was a shame to see that majestic structure destroyed . <p> One more was a drug store that was on the SW corner of Holt &amp; Towne , I think it was one of the Hamilton Drugs , but I 'm not sure . When I was just a small kid I had a crush on a pretty brunette named Priscilla that worked there . Someone had mentioned the sharks at Ganesha Hills Park , I had forgotten about them , but I now remember when they put them in . They were pretty cool at that time ! Good blog , keep it going ! <p> and that 's 50 comments ! DA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of my own memories ( not newer ones from working in the Model Colony Room ! ) : the OReillys Restaurant was owned in part by Dr. William Kelber , longtime veterinarian and library board member in Ontario . <p> When we moved to Ontario in 1953 , there were only a few markets we went to the Shopping Bag on Foothill just east of Euclid ( now PepBoys ? ) , Torleys on B St in Ontario and King Cole out on Holt Blvd . <p> And from hubbie : his dad had a hotd og stand called Mannys on Holt Ave just across from the old Pomona High School . One could get to it using the pedestrian underpass ( ! ! ) going under Holt from the school to the north side of Holt . <p> I 've heard of that underpass ! Never knew you could use it for access to hot dogs . What a concept . DA <p> Steve Julian <p> Tad , thanks I 'd forgotten about Ewarts . Oddly enough , we shopped so often at JP Evans : my dad got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back . I also liked to sort through baseball bats and gloves at Beamons along the mall . <p> Across from Sears , along Holt at Indian Hill/Mills , was Standard Brands and Angels Hardware , where my dad liked to buy wood and colored plastic for his homemade cabinets . In the Indian Hill Village , just west of Sears , was Larry Wellins Jewelers . Once the Village deteriorated , Larry moved his store to Holt and Central . A son opened another store in Chino ; the primary one is now gone . <p> And speaking of Holt Avenue , remember the stationery store Stockwell &amp; Binney ? Across the street , on the southeast corner , was Mels drive-through . Room for just one or two cars next to the walk-up window . I loved the sauce on those skimpy burgers , which I 'd get after one of the Lawson brothers on Third Street east of Garey sheared my head . Did n't  Mels get turned into a locksmith shop ? <p> One other memory is construction of the Montclair Plaza . My grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Hospital in 1968 and 1969 when the plaza went up . I could see the progress from his room . <p> I do n't  know about a locksmith shop , but in recent years Mels was a sketchy place called the Smoke Shop , and a druggie hangout , until police and City Hall got them shut down last year . DA <p> Steve Julian <p> Oh , one more memory . Tad , the radio station that gave the smudge pot reports on those chilly nights was 50,000 watt clear channel AM 640 KFI " Earle C. Anthony , Incorporated . " <p> Charles Bentley <p> GREETINGS : <p> Since Steve has touched on the subject of radio , how about the stations that used to reside in this region ? <p> While I remember it as KSOM AM ( 1510 ) and FM ( 93.5 ) with the transmitter on Ninth Street in Cucamonga ( southeast of where the Cask &amp; Cleaver restaurant sits ) , my parents recall when it was KASK ( at least the AM side ) . There was KWOW AM ( 1600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country &amp; western format . I know it later became KMNY with mainly business programing . I also know Mt . San Antonio College had its own station , KSAC ( ? ) , but I do n't  remember much more than that . Then there was a station , KKAR AM ( ? ) , that I believe operated out of Pomona and did a lot of on-location broadcasts throughout the area . <p> A quick word on KFI I , too , remember hearing the frost warnings on that clear-channel station . Where I grew up in east Ontario , KFI and KSOM were the two strongest signals you could always pick up on even the oldest , beat-up radios . Of course , KSOM came in so clear because the transmission towers were less than a mile away ! <p> Can anyone else offer more thoughts on this topic of things past ? <p> And the blog goes on . <p> Does it ever ! Thanks for the radio daze , Chas . DA <p> Linda <p> Charles , <p> Wasnt there a KOCS back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tad Decker <p> Steve Julian mentioned the smudge pot reports broadcast over KFI in years past ; my maternal grandfather was one of those who stoked smudge pots to help save the local orange crop from the freezing temperatures . He spoke of having to work in the bitter cold while wearing clothing saturated with oil . ( He witnessed at least one worker catch fire . ) <p> During the 1930s , my grandparents lived on a small orange ranch on Holt Ave owned by my great grandparents ( located at the northwest corner of Holt and Clark , which later was the location of Pomona Dodge , and is now occupied by an Asian shopping center ) . <p> One last thought about smudging my grandparents tell of the soot being so thick in the air that homeowners would take down their drapes and cover the furniture , and would need to repaint every year . They said the air quality could be so bad that they would have trouble seeing across the sanctuary of the old First Baptist Church building at Holt and Garey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange ranches on Holt ; new car dealers on Holt ; and filthy air due to smudging , that makes our air conditions today seem pristine ! <p> Not to mention the First Baptist Church building at Holt and Garey . DA <p> Jon Scott <p> My dad took my brother and me to KWOW a few times . It was a little building in the middle of a field in south Pomona . He knew one of the jocks , but I do n't  remember very much of being there . <p> KASK at one time had a storefront studio on the Pomona Mall , about the 400 block of east 2nd street . My buddy Andy and I would take the city bus from Garey Hi after school , and sometime during school , and hang out with the DJ . He gave us free records , let us cue up records , and even talk on the radio a little . <p> KKAR I do n't  remember where they were at , but the first record our band Jerry and The Uniques recorded got played some . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . They finally said , " That 's it , Jerry , do n't  call anymore . " <p> Randall Volm <p> I remember back in the day ( 1980s ) when I used to go work out at Jack LaLlanes Health Spa in West Covina , and then go to Bengies on Central Avenue in Upland . Bengies was the place to go for big sandwiches like patty melts and burgers that were huge including steak fries . <p> Who could forget about Castaways Restaurant up on the hill next to Pomona Valley Mining Company ? The once-famous restaurant that was really owned by Bob Denver and Alan Hale of " Gilligans Island " fame . <p> If sportsbars was your thing , one could go to Sneakers . <p> Back in the ( 1980s ) when on every corner ( it seemed ) were gay bars . There was Robbies , Gents , Alibi East just to name a few . <p> It was a different time back then , and I 'm just loving reliving those times in this blog , as I 'm sure so is everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for another article that just might get this much attention , if not more . How about a blog dedicated to " Things that are still here " ? <p> I 'd like to kick that off with what I mentioned earlier , the Pomona Valley Mining Company . What do you think ? <p> After this thread plays out , we might try that , Randy . About Castaways being owned by the Skipper and Gilligan , I admit I have my doubts . Sounds like a ( sub ) urban legend . Anyone know if its true ? DA <p> Dave Linck <p> Great memories , everyone ! The mention of Bergers Restaurant in Ontario ( they served the best burgers and malts ever ! ) at Holt &amp; Euclid brought back my thoughts of Coffee Johns , a 24-hour coffee shop which was a half block west on Holt and the site of one of my first real jobs . It is now a Mexican cafe . <p> Also , nice to hear someone else remembers Edwards Ranch Restaurant on Mission in Pomona . My grandmother always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the outasite chicken . <p> No one mentioned The Hot Dog Show , a red shack that stood between Taco Lita and Grinder Haven at San Antonio and Holt in Ontario . On Fridays , my dad would get seven hamburgers for a dollar ! It burned down , as did adjacent King Cole Market , in the early 60s . I visited both smoldering sites , as well as the fresh cinders of Thriftys Drug Store at 4th and Mountain in Ontario , on my trusty Western Auto bike . <p> Another unmentioned eatery was the Chicken Coop , featuring broasted chicken , located midblock on Holt between Mountain and San Antonio . <p> Probably the funniest memory served up was the person who mentioned Burger Qa purveyor of modern fast food on Mountain Ave below G Street in Ontario ( they had the first drive up speakers in town for ordering ) that featured hamburgers with the secret vinegary " Q " sauce . I ate a lot thereI dated the counter girl ! <p> Yes , Mels Drive In was converted to a locksmith store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verne Rd in Pomona near Shakeys Pizza &amp; Mayfair Market .. Breakfast at Carls , Holt west of East Endbest pancakes , my favorite was the Plantation Platter . <p> JMac <p> Always the enabler , we need to continue the reminiscing into the 60s , which is apropos of the subject . <p> A few comments from others reminded me of long-forgotten area treasures . I had forgotten all about the King Cole markets , and especially Burger Q. My paternal grandparents lived just east of Mountain on I St. I can remember going to both places . <p> Randall , regarding the Castaway being owned by Gilligan and the Skipper , I agree with David that it probably was an urban legend . Alan Hale did own a restaurant on La Cienega called the Lobster Barrel , but I have n't seen any reference to the former eatery atop Ganesha . <p> With regards to the radio stations in the area , Mt Sacs student station was indeed KSAC . <p> Lastly , how about indigenous area delivery companies ? Growing up , our milkman was employed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidewalk Sundaes from the Tropical Ice Cream Co , which I believe was located on Reservoir ( ? ) . Naturally , we all looked forward to the afternoon delivery of baked goodness from the Helms truck . I can still see those drawers being pulled out with all those donuts . <p> ray escoto <p> Across the street from the Hull House was Roys Liquor &amp; Delicatessen .. Awesome Beef Dips ! ! ! How about all the TASTEE FREEZES around town ? ? ? Can you name the locations ? ? <p> I know one was on Mission between Garey and Towne . Its now a Chinese food outlet ( Bamboo Express , if memory serves ) and still has the awesome Tastee Freeze sign . I think they even serve ice cream . DA <p> JMac <p> I can think of two . On Garey just south of the high school and near the Pom Lanes bowling alley . The other was pretty much on the campus of La Verne college . <p> John Clifford <p> I agree with JMac that the Castaways was n't owned by Gilligan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Skippers Lobster Barrel " on La Cienega which had a drawing of Alan Hale , Jr . on the sign and was frequented by him in his later years . <p> The Castaway in Pomona was a sister to the one on the hill above Burbank , which I was more familiar with . A traditional steak restaurant with dark wood and large fireplace , and open fire pits on the outdoor dining patios . <p> Scott <p> I remember the Tastee Freeze on Mountain ( now Spikes ) across from McDonalds . It had great food . But I believe McDonalds coming along was the reason for its demise . <p> Fred Henderson <p> Hi Dave . Havent heard mention of the ABC Union Stores . One on Central in Montclair near Moreno and the other at " Five Points " ( Holt and Ganesha Blvd . ) . <p> Liberty Groves on 19th ; Cucamonga Mesa Growers ; then there was the house on Euclid and 19th owned by the " Cracker Jack " king . <p> For those not in the know , the Cracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cracker Jack to stay fresh , so that it could be shipped across the country and become a nationally known product . DA <p> ca24 <p> I remember the ABC Store . My mom was in charge of Security for Sage Stores and ABC was part of that . She spent a lot of time at the Montclair store and I was the shoeshine boy at the barber shop there . <p> Steve Julian <p> Pomona had two Top 40 radio stations : AM 1220 KKAR and AM 1600 KWOW . I remember KKAR being active in remote broadcasts . I worked briefly for KWOW as a news stringer in the late 1970s , hired by Dennis Michael who went on to CNN as an entertainment reporter . <p> Loved the story about the grandfather who stoked the smudge pots . Mine worked as a pipe fitter at the old Kaiser steel mill in Fontana . Hed make the drive each day to and from Pomona . <p> We also had Shady Grove Dairy deliveries of OJ and milk in glass bottles with the paper caps . And my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted the Helms truck to stop . <p> There was a small church on Euclid at C Street , I believe , in Ontario . Purportedly haunted , it became the Gallery Theatre and hosted numerous dramas and musicals . One of my favorite performances ( that I was n't in ) was Fiddler on the Roof . A local judge , Duane Thomas , played Tevya . He was terrific . The structures now gone . A fellow alum , for you NPR listeners , is Charles Phoenix . If you 've never seen his God Bless Americana slide shows or related books , they 're well worth the time . <p> No doubt many of us remember seeing a film at the Fox Theatre in Pomona . Just a block west , on Third Street , was a UA Theatre . I remember seeing King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable there in 63 or 64 . <p> Charles Phoenix is a favorite of mine . Readers of this blog should track down his book " Cruising the Pomona Valley 1930 Thru 1970 , " a guidebook to current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , burger stands , etc. ) from Pomona , Ontario , etc. , with vintage photos and ads . I consult it frequently . DA <p> JMac <p> Charles also has a great website . I bet hed enjoy reading through this posting . <p> Another TASTEE-FREEZE location was on Holt just east of St. Josephs Catholic Church ( Pomona ) . <p> Someone asked about Henrys as a DISCO ? ? ? You 're so right . It was , to the best of my recollection , called Tiffanys and then Odyssey . Or maybe vice-versa . <p> I think you have those in the correct order . DA <p> Donna <p> My favorite.Donahoos ! <p> But you do know Donahoos is still here , right ? DA <p> JMac <p> Ray , if you 're talking about the Tastee Freeze , residing on the northeast end of the church parking lot , I remember it being a Foster Freeze . <p> Which brings up the other establishments , no longer around on Holt , in the vicinity of St Joes . Probably one of the most popular was Di Gangis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chateau , across the street from DiGangis . Down along the west side , on the corner of Holt &amp; Laurel , would have been Naples Italian Restaurant . <p> Lastly , on my walk home from St Joes after school , was another of those great neighborhood markets during those daysBells Market on Orange Grove . <p> Charles Bentley <p> GREETINGS : <p> I find it amazing that so much information is still available through the collective memory of your readers , David . No question , this is a hot-button topic for a lot of us here in the area . <p> Quick adds to the TASTEE-FREEZE query : Yes , there was one adjacent to the University of La Verne campus . For those of us who were commuter students ( and those averse to eating the food in the schools dining hall ! ) , it was the place to grab lunch without leaving campus . The In-N-Out was a popular evening/late night choice , but during the school day it was more convenient to walk over to TF ( and you did n't  lose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Music Annex , a practice area for the universitys music program . <p> There was also a TASTEE-FREEZE located on Central Avenue in Montclair , south of I-10 . It has changed hands several times since then I recall it was El Pavo , serving good Mexican food but still retains a great deal of the " classic " TASTEE-FREEZE architectural style . <p> I also vaguely recall one on Foothill Blvd. , but for the life of me I cant remember the exact location or even the city . <p> One more " memory " jog How many people remember Hulls Barbecue on Central Ave . just south of Foothill Blvd. ? It served ( among other things ) North Carolina-style BBQ and was a favorite haunt of Rick Dees . <p> The radio memories thread is a great one . I thought I was the only one who remembered KASK at 1510AM , then a top-40 station . One year ( I think 1967 ) they had a promotion involving one of their deejays who vowed to remain on the air continuously ( without sleep ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I recall , devolving into word salad just before nodding off . <p> KWOW was indeed country western in the early sixties but went to automated pop format in the mid-seventies . My then-boyfriend was the night engineer , maintaining the computer-run system that paired the prerecorded announcer with the correct pop song . Occasionally the computer would go wacky , alarms would go off , the wrong song would be back-announcedand then the irate station manager would be on the phone . He never seemed to sleep ! <p> Randall Volm <p> GREETINGS : <p> Another Tastee Freeze was spotted in Upland . Although its demise was n't til just a few years ago ( 5 or 6 years or so ) , it served the best ice cream in the Inland Empire . This location was on Mountain Avenue , just north of the 10 freeway on the left , directly across from the " what 's not there " Millers Outpost . <p> One of the best jobs I ever had was working for the Cask N Cleaver chain back in the early to mid 80s . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night at Cask , and the next night at El Gato Gordo and the following night at Lord Charleys . El Gato Gordo &amp; Lord Charleys , again , " what 's not there anymore . " <p> Attention anyone : I need some help here . I 'm trying to think of the name of a restaurant in the Upland area ( Foothill Blvd ) that was next to Lord Charleys on the west side . Can anyone help ? p.s . It too is " not here anymore . " <p> Tad Decker <p> To Charles Bentley : You mentioned your recollection of a Tastee Freeze somewhere on Foothill Blvd I think that there was one located in Upland in the vicinity of Foothill and Grove on the north side ( near the current Arbys , Midas or Paint Bucket ) . <p> And to Randy Volm : I have great memories of the food at the Lord Charleys restaurant . I am not sure of the restaurant you are thinking about to the west of there , but I do remember the large A-framed DiCensos Italian restaurant located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I think it met its end when the Lowes center was being built ) . <p> Ill throw in a few other fast food restaurantsanyone remember Pup n Taco , or Naugles ? <p> Speaking of DiCensos , their daughter is , I believe , a hostess at Cafe Montclair ! DA <p> ray escoto <p> Jmac , you are right about Foster Freeze location next to ST . JOES . Now to help Randall . Was it OLIVERS you 're thinking of ? ? Olivers became Lord Charleys . Across the street " NEW CHINA " used to be " SAGE HEN " with a beautiful neon sign on Foothill . Of course all this info is to the " best of my recollection . " A trip down Central Ave reminds me of OZZIES OASIS Hamburger stand &amp; one of the first BAKERS TACOS .. both in the vicinity of Central &amp; Kingsley . <p> I remember The Dinnerhorn restaurant on Second Street , next door to Fedway . I never went in it but from the outside it looked really " swanky . " I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1960 , he would have dined at The Dinnerhorn . Anyone have memories of the inside ? here 's a photo : <p> The Dinnerhorn later became Robbies , then a series of shortlived nightclubs , then a new incarnation of Robbies . DA <p> ray escoto <p> Pup n Taco ( Pomona ) N/W corner of Holt/Towne . I 'm going to take a shot at location of Jans Seafood . It was north of Hillbilly Haven ( Towne/Holt ) . Jans was converted to " Vallarta " Restaurant . Any confirmations on this info ? Boy ! ! Towne &amp; Holt was a busy corner . <p> Danny Mac <p> This could go on and on . We used to ride our bikes in the KWOW 1600 field area of Olive and Mills and who could forget the jingle.Anytime you 're ready , anytime at all , Listen to the station at the top of the dialKWOW 1600 Pomona.California . <p> Carolyn <p> Hi David , <p> What a great walk down memory lane . A coworker of mine brought your blog to my attention ( and I 'm glad she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Kelber ( a.k.a . Dr. Bill ) . <p> Dr. Kelbers Animal Hospital was an ugly green building on the southwest corner of Holt and Mountain in Ontario since the late 40s . My dad treated local residents dogs and cats for over 40 years , and he loved every minute of it . Each one of us five kids had to put in our time working at the pet hospital when we were growing up . Great memories . My dad and mom , Rose Kelber , loved Ontario and spent their lives proudly serving their community . They are greatly missed by all . <p> As posted by Steve F. , my dad was not an owner of OReillys restaurant , but rather my godparents , Ray and Millie Schulman , were the owners . OReillys not only had the best hamburgers in town and the aforementioned ice cream sundae bar , but also had the most wonderful homemade pies , made fresh daily by Mrs. Parisien . Oh , and we should n't forget their broasted chicken , which was spectacular . Millie , by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living in Ontario at the age of 98 years old . <p> Thanks for the great column ! Write on ! <p> Will do , Carolyn ! Thanks for the great comments . I love the name Mrs. Parisien . DA <p> Linda <p> Randy Volm : <p> Was the restaurant west of Lord Charleys called Olivers ? <p> anonymous <p> Cotton Goffs Volkswagen <p> ray escoto <p> Hi Carolyn , Was there a public swimming pool in that vicinity Mountain/Holt ? ? ? Maybe east of OReillys ? <p> Jules <p> How about the Kosher Pickle on South Garey just before the 71 ? They had great deli food . There was also a gym next door ( cant recall the name ) . Last time I looked the entire site was fenced . Too bad . <p> Tad Decker <p> Ray , <p> I remember a swimming pool near the southwest corner of Mountain and Holt , but the one I am thinking of was not a public pool , but rather a smallish one in front of a nondescript commercial building that I believe once housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occupied by a Harley-Davidson dealership , and has since been remodeled extensively ( and the pool was filled in years ago ) . <p> And Carolyn , I remember your fathers old veterinary building at the corner of Mountain and Holt . Also , as a child I had several meals at the old OReillys restaurant ( I liked the sundae bar ! ) , and now I work in that same building every daymy fathers company , The Paint Bucket , purchased the building from the Schulmans in the late 1970s . Even today , we will have customers jokingly order a burger along with their semi-gloss enamel . <p> MelanieR <p> My dad used to own the " pool " property and turned it into a flooring store . It was originally a pool sales room ( 2 in ground in the front ) , supplies , and there was in indoor Olympic size pool in the back for the swimming academy . <p> ray escoto <p> Has anyone mentioned Sir Georges Smorgasboard on Garey Ave south of La Verne Rd ? Also in that area was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindo #1 ? ? was a very small stand on Mission Blvd , west of San Antonio ( Pomona ) <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear Linda , <p> I 'm not really sure what the restaurant was that was located on Foothill Blvd. next to the Lord Charlies Restaurant ( to the west ) . Although I do recall a restaurant being there at one time . Its why I 've enlisted the help of people in this thread to help me out . But , thanks for your help anyway = <p> While reading through these blogs day after day , Im surprised no one has mentioned Loves Woodpit BBQ . One of the few places in town to have really good ribs and beans . Why , I still even remember a portion of their commercial jingle , " When Youre In Loves , the Whole Worlds Delicious . " Just brings back a lot of memories of days gone by . <p> MelanieR <p> Was it the Olive Tree ? <p> JMac <p> A couple of birthdays over the weekend reminded me of where my Mom would get our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe was on Holt near Erie ? <p> That was THE place to get one of those great themed birthday sheet cakes . All of them 3D , such as a prehistoric scene with volcanos made of icing , with several different colors of food dye for effect . Scattered around the cake were several plastic dinosaurs and palm trees larger than the dinos themselves . The white cake with lemon filling was terrific as I recall . <p> Fast forward to the 70s and the Magnolia Peach on Mountain &amp; Arrow in Upland , along with the Ruddy Duck on Foothill in Claremont , were a couple of my after-work hangouts . The Magnolia Peach was a very popular happy hour hangout as I recollect . <p> David , we just might get this post to 100 yet ! ! <p> If we do n't  , it wont be through lack of effort on your part . Thanks , JMac . DA <p> Sue Anne <p> Was the restaurant next ? <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear Sue Anne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gato Gordo . El Gato Gordo was located on Foothill Blvd. @ Mountain Ave . ( where Walgreens now sits ) . Lord Charlies sat west on Foothill Blvd , west of Central Ave . Thanks for your help anyway = <p> Jules <p> I heard that the Taco Bell on Mission east of Garey just closed down . And there used to be an IHOP on Holt and East End . <p> That was an original IHOP too . It was knocked down maybe four years ago . Ditto with the Van de Kamps building on the other side of Holt . DA <p> Linda <p> I 'm really thinking now that the restaurant on Foothill next to Lord Charlies was Olivers , and I believe it burned down . <p> Carolyn <p> Hey Jules , <p> That 's so interesting about the Paint Bucket . Small world . <p> Actually , the Schulmans owned a paint store on the north side of Holt , just west of Euclid prior to opening OReillys . It was called Raymonds Fuller Paint Store . Quite a few years after they opened the paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Holt , east of Euclid called Laddies . That was way back in the 50s . <p> I believe the pool you 're talking about was Shinkle Pools ( not so sure about the spelling ) , which was next door to my fathers pet hospital , and yes , it was later sold to a Harley dealership . <p> Estaben Calabacas <p> Laddies closed in the early 70s and was reopened as Andys Burgers <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear Linda , <p> Guess what ? you 're right . The restaurant next to Lord Charlies was Olivers before it burned down . <p> I had a long talk with my dad about that particular restaurant , and he reminded me , that he was going to go into a partnership with someone that worked at the Cask N Cleaver in Rancho Cucamonga a few years prior to burning down . My dad , at that time , owned B&amp;E Alignment in Ontario , on Holt , east of Mountain Ave . Its still there , now my brother Robert owns and runs the place . <p> Thanks to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now confident that I can rely on people here to help me out , whenever I need it . = <p> David , hope to see 100th post sometime soon = <p> For a while I was worried wed have 100 posts on the topic of what was next to Lord Charleys ! Glad that was cleared up . DA <p> Carolyn <p> Hey David , <p> Looks like the " posted by " slots are a little bit off on the last three postings . I was the one who posted the comments about the Paint Bucket , OReillys and Shinkle Pools , on January 24 at 3:55pm , not Linda . <p> Definitely ! Every time I ever entered it , I recall a very distinct fragrance wafting about the place . <p> I have no idea what you guys are talking about . DA <p> Tom Lamb <p> Do n't  forget " Gravity Hill " on the way to Mount Baldy . You would park at the bottom of the grade and roll uphill . Unfortunately it is gone since they regraded the road . <p> Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bob House <p> " The Jungle " in Claremont : The area of the Pomona College campus north of 1st Street , between Amherst and Mills ( there 's a soccer/rugby field there now ) was naturally overgrown and not maintained up through the 60s . Kind of a pocket of rural wildlands next to downtown Claremont . <p> It was the site of most of the illicit fun you can imagine college students and other youthful Claremonters might engage in . Its reputation was such that there was always a little edge of fear about just walking through the Jungle . <p> Is there a prize for the 100th post ? <p> Is the thanks of a grateful nation enough ? Good job , Bob . DA <p> judi <p> I was telling my mom , Jeanette ( Acuna ) Holsten about this thread , and she was wondering if anyone remembers one of the first drive-in restaurants in the 40s called " Monas Drive-In " on Holt , near Campus in Ontario . Two of her aunts worked there as car hops , wearing short skirts and serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a man name Price Barrett . <p> The " Gravity Hill " post reminded me of another road relic.The " Baseline Dips . " The series of road moguls from about Mills to Benson . Anytme in my youth that we were east of those , I 'd beg Pops to drive home via the Baseline Dips , for that roller coaster ride . Naturally , when I got my license , it then became an early XGames sport , to see how far we could launch our vehicles ! <p> Randall Volm <p> Judi , I do n't  remember " Monas Drive-In , " it was slightly before my time . The closest I can come to it is , I remember every Sunday , after church , my parents would take us kids to the Dairy Queen that sat on Holt near Campus in their heyday . <p> JMac Holy cow , man ! I forgot all about the " Baseline Dips . " OMG we had so much fun driving it doing 50 , 60 , even 70mph ! It was probably the most fun I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I do remember about that is , it was n't highly reccommended at high rates of speed after a full meal ! We were just kids then , who cared ? LOL ! Wow ! Thanks for the memory ! <p> Linda <p> How about the Guasti Dip , that was a real zinger at about 50 mph. 19th Street was a good road for dips in the 50s , from Euclid to wherever . Like Randall said we were just kids , but it was fun ! ! ! ! <p> ray escoto <p> Was that section of Baseline called " MILE of DIPS " ? ? ? ? <p> ray escoto <p> WOW ! ! ! All this driving around ! ! ! What was the price of gas ? JIMMYS Gas Station was my choice . Fill it up with ETHYL please ! ! <p> Linda <p> Ray , <p> Gas was about 25 cents a gallon , we would all pitch in 50 cents , buy around $2.00 worth of gas and " cruise " the night away . Seems like another world now ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  here anymore : Gas under a dollar . I remember when in high school , I 'd go to the skypower station in Azusa and get 4 gallons for $1 . That would usually be enough to get me to and from the Village Theater in Azusa where I worked through the weekend . <p> Gene Harvey <p> Well , David , you knew I would have to weigh in sooner or later on places that used to be here . Its a real joy reading all the entries and realizing that I ai n't  the only one that remembers the way it used to be here in Pomona Valley ! <p> I did n't  grow up here , but I did come as a young adult in the 60s and did n't  know when I was transferred in to run the Village Theatre in Claremont that I would fall in love with the area and keep managing and owning movie theatres ( and one restaurant ) in the area right on through my life and I 'm not done yet ! <p> No one has mentioned Bondellos , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side of Holt east of Central . It had the old red leather booths and had the best steak sandwiches at very moderate prices . <p> How I have wished over the years that it was still around . It had the type of atmoshere of the Mural House near the airport but was smaller . <p> Suddenly I 'm hungry for a steak sandwich . Especially one at a moderate price . DA <p> Randall Volm <p> Dear David , <p> here 's to my final post , in this thread , about a place that was beloved by the people who went there throughout its existence . <p> This particular place , exquisite in decor , attracted millions , if not more , yet it was n't a popular restaurant nor a hotel chain during its tenure . As a matter of fact , it was n't even in the IE. <p> Centrally located in the heart of Orange County , Buena Park to be exact , once stood Movieland Wax Museum . Wax figures of celebrities in their most famous roles they were known for , such as Dorothy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going there as a kid , and well into my adult life . <p> Sadly , everything has to make way for progress . Movieland Wax Museum finally closed its doors for the last time in 2005 . In early 2007 , Buena Park City Council decided to condemn the building to make way for a Best Buy and a few restauants . <p> Linda <p> David , <p> Thank you for this wonderful thread that gave many of us a chance to remember a time that we loved . It brought many a smile , a tear of two , and lots of good conversation ! I still say this column is why I subscribe to this paper . <p> You 're welcome , Linda , and thanks for the support . DA <p> Abe Simpson <p> You see , back in those days , rich men would ride around in Zeppelins , dropping coins on people , and one day I seen J. D. Rockefeller flying by . So I run out of the house with a big washtub . I 'd just used it that morning to wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking bird . We 'd always have walking bird on Thanksgiving with all the trimmings : cranberries , injun eyes , yams stuffed with gunpowder . Then we 'd all watch football , which in those days was called " baseball " . <p> Anyway , we cant bust heads like we used to , but we have our ways . One trick is to tell em stories that do n't  go anywhere like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville . I needed a new heel for my shoe , so , I decided to go to Morganville , which is what they called Shelbyville in those days . <p> So I tied an onion to my belt , which was the style at the time . Now , to take the ferry cost a nickel , and in those days , nickels had pictures of bumblebees on em . Give me five bees for a quarter , youd say . Now where were we ? <p> Oh yeah the important thing was I had an onion on my belt , which was the style at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones <p> Always a treat to hear about the old days from Homer Simpsons father . Thanks for dropping by , Abe . DA <p> first , I would like to start off by saying that Its great reading all this stuff about the Pomona and surrounding Pomona areas . See compared to all of you I 'm a pup , not to offend anyone or call anyone old , but here I am thinking " shoot I never knew places like the ihop or van de kamps existed in pomona . " I just thought I 'd post up on here and update you guys on what 's in Pomona now . <p> Well on eastend and holt where the Sears used to be , well , its a High school ( Village Academy High ) . Now I actually graduated from there , class of 05 first graduating class ever . I think the van de kamps was closed down for a good while and finally torn down the IHOP became Tacos Mexico and then torn down all due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be , it was a thrifty drug store ( pretty good ice cream ) along with an ALPA grocery store and now a 99 cents only store and Cardenas grocery store . Across the street ( north of holt ) used to be a car dealership that burned down and now its a rite aid . The tastee freeze in Pomona on Town and mission became a Fastees which was a mexican , chinese , and american fast food dive all in one ( the best $1.07 burgers around ) , and then later became ( current ) bamboo express . <p> The locksmith on palomares and holt was a tobacco shop and did close down because of junkies but now its just a vacant little building surrounded by Wells fargo bank and Pep boys . Garey and second street is like the hot spot for teenagers with the glass house putting on rock shows every weekends and the arts colony ( second street east of garey ) hosting farmers market every wednesday . <p> The Fox theater is going under renovations as so is the Hotel were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dr. Seusss Cat and the Hat were shot on second street . <p> As for the sharks at Ganesha park , I think they are gone but I remember them being there when I was in second grade . One of my teachers from VAHS ( Mr. Sherban Cira ) showed us a movie called " Gang Boy " and that 's probably the only images I have of olde Pomona . <p> Regardless , Pomona is a whole lot different now than what you guys makes it sound like . <p> As for Montclair , I actually work at Target and I remember the cinemas at the mall I must have been 7 when I first visited Montclair Plaza . <p> Quite frankly I would have loved to grown up in the 50s and 60s , but the 90s and the 2000s are n't  bad we get to live the stuff well be reminiscing about in years to come , I already miss that taco bell on mission blvd . <p> jerry lerma , the location you described Pup n taco was is now an autozone and jans seafood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walgreens . <p> Oh , yeah , Vallarta was next to the also fondly remembered Red Hill Pizza . DA <p> Linda <p> Does anyone remember what Indian Hill Blvd. was called back in the 50s ? ? <p> Alexander Avenue . DA <p> Jeff K <p> How about the old Linbrook/Lindbrook hardware store near Moreno/Central in the 70s . Also , White Front on Mtn . Ave . south of the 10fwy which later became Fed Mart ? Ah , the good old days . Worked at Mr. Steak as a teen . Greatest corner ever with El Gato Gordo , Mtn . Liquor , Mr. Steak , Boars Head ! <p> Mike <p> Wow memories I do n't  have time to go into detail ( maybe later ) . I worked at Greenes Deli with Chris , his mom Dawn , Jim , the owner , John on liquor sidethis was in 78 and 79 . <p> And what about Mama Rosas Pizza by Schiros liquor and right across the street fromahhh DiGanges Grinders ! And then there wasFosters Freeze ! Damn ! Got ta go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mike . Come by again when you can spend more time . DA <p> John C <p> How about a place called something like JoJos in Upland in the 1970s . It was right next to ( north of ) the San Bernardino Freeway , east of Euclid I believe . I remember there was a real screwy freeway on/off-ramp connected with it . <p> Did JoJos become Cocos ? Sounds like the same area . DA <p> Roxanne Basica <p> Yes Jojos became Cocos now a church ? Roxanne <p> beatleboo <p> Jehovahs Witness Temple . Just finished it . <p> beatleboo <p> I live a few blocks from there , now . The freeway exits onto 7th St. I remember Cocos but now JoJos . There is now a Jehovahs Witness Temple on that site . They just finished it last week . <p> John C <p> In the late 1970s there was a restaurant on the south side of Foothill ( near the Claremont Colleges ) called something like " Danish Kitchen " . <p> It was set back from Foothill and most of the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't expensive . They had a swamp cooler for " air conditioning " as I recall . I used to love their pot roast ! <p> As I remember the waitresses/staff were " Classics " , just like the ones at Crystal Cafeteria in Pomona . Anyone know how long it was " Danish Kitchen " ( or whatever ) and any other history about the use of the building ? <p> Great to hear about those radio memories . I was the mid-day dj on Top 40 1510/93.5 KASK Ontario in 1967. 1510 was KOCS before it was KASK . Went back there when it was KSOM and top 40 again in 1975 . I also did midnight to 6am on country KWOW 1600 in 1970 . In 1974 I was at 1220 country KKAR ( under the name Jack Daniels there ) . Jonny Bruce , KDES-FM Palm Springs . <p> Develyn Sperling <p> Does anyone remember a little place called the Tiger Cafe on Holt Blvd ? My Uncle Tommy owned it . It stayed open after all the Blvd. bars closed . People lined up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What was the name of the tiny diner across the street from it ? Hows this ? On the corner of Holt and Campus . The Bamboo Hut . <p> Next door was a liquor store with great penny candy . Next to that was Goldies variety store . It had great , cheap toys . But , she was a mean old bird and kids were actually afraid to go in there . <p> Browsing through this blog , I read the comment from John Clifford , regarding Henrys Restaurant in Pomona , CA . It brought back many memories . <p> Yes , it looked like a flying saucer , which in reality was the design for the drive-in parking . The restaurant itself had a coffee shop , a dining room , a cocktail lounge and a huge room for banquets . My first job was there , as a busboy . I worked my way to become the a soda jerk , then the fry cookwent into the service , got out and continued my culinary career . The owner of that restaurant also owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcadia . All were called Henrys Chicken-In-The-Rough , except Arcadia , which was Carpenters . <p> The Pomona address was at the corner of Garey and Foothill Blvds . I miss the place as much as I miss my father , James P. Kennedy , the owner of these establishments . Went I went to work there as a freshman in high school , my father told me I was not to tell anyone who I was , I was to be treated like everyone else . However a waitress recognized me and said , You 're Mr. Ks boy , are n't  you ? <p> I admitted so , and she spoke this praise which I now know at a much older age , how priceless her comment was . <p> " Gary " , she said , " I 'm going to tell you something about your Dad , that wont mean much now , but will someday . You see , in this business ( restaurant ) people gossip a lot . Customers gossip about customers , workers talk about other workers , .. its really a shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never heard him say one bad word about anyone , and I have never heard one person every say a bad word about him . Your Dad is one of the finest men on this earth . " <p> She was right . I did n't  understand it then , but her words stayed with me , and I understand them now . Wish I could have been more like him . <p> He passed away in 1993 , just as Henrys restaurants are also gone . Thanks Mr. Clifford for reminding me of how lucky my life was , and still is . <p> Wonderful to hear from you , Gary . DA <p> george thomas <p> I used to live in Pomona from 1975-1986 . I used to remermber a restaurant named Robbies on Second Street . Is it still there or has it been torn down ? Or does anyone have pictures of it when it was still standing that they maybe can share with me ? I recently saw an article on it where 40 years ago Bobby Kennedy spoke there while campaigning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buffums can you share also ? Thank you very much . <p> Robbies closed a couple of years ago and the building is owned and used by a Western University . DA <p> Ralph Torlucci <p> I worked there for over 7 years <p> MelanieR <p> I waitressed there too when it first opened . I worked for Mario at his first bar as well , before he bought Robbies . <p> Sheri Hodges <p> Ray Escotothanks for mentioning Montes in the blog . I came across some old tabloids for Diamond Bar ( circa 66 ) that has an ad for Montes Diner on 1300 Bonita in La Verne . So I decided to see if it was still around . I love the ad as it still uses the old phone numbers we grew up withTheirs was LY 3-3290 . <p> Sheri <p> PSthey were closed on Wednesdays ! <p> Joey <p> I worked at lord charlies in 71 . <p> eddie alaniz <p> So cool to have found this website . As I have read many of the " memories " of Pomona and surrounding areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hometown of Pomona . <p> I was born at Pomnona Valley Community Hospital in 1950 and grew up in the area of Center St. and Park Ave . near Gold Strike Market . In reading about eateries in Pomona , various mentions have been referred to . I believe it was Hillbilly Haven Drive-in . I so remember those great tasting burgers . Does anyone know the ingredients used to make up this great burger ? It seems that the buns used were made of garlic bread . What a great hamburger it was . Thanks for the help . <p> Also does anybody remember the record shop name that was located on Second Ston the same block as Thriftys . <p> Anyone ? DA <p> Ren <p> Macs records <p> dale burkholder <p> Thank you for the memories of Pup n Taco and Red Hill Pizza . I loved their BBQ pizza . <p> Does anyone remember a Mexican restaurant on Holt either at the corner of Palomares or Gibbs Street ? I remember walking in and there was always a woman making tortillas there in the entryway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been 1979 to 1984 . <p> beatleboo <p> You might be talking about Espiaus Mexican restaurant , Dale . It was a great place . There is one in Claremont now . I 'm not sure if it is a descendant of the original or not . <p> Tad Decker <p> Dale , <p> The restaurant located at the northwest corner of Palomares and Holt during the time period you mentioned would have been La Cabana . <p> Tads probably right , although he means northeast , I think . DA <p> Jim <p> Before Red Hill Pizza opened at Towne and Holt , the building was occupied by the Pail O Chicken restaurant which IMO served the absolute best pan fried chicken extra crispy and served in a skillet . Anyone remember ? <p> Tad Decker <p> Dale and David , <p> Yes , I definitely meant the northEAST corner for the location of La Cabana . Funny , my mind was picturing the proper location even as my fingers were typing in the wrong one . Must be getting old . <p> Were always in the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all caps ! DA <p> Billy E. Settle <p> Con DA Give Bob a break , after all he s setting in the Dark huntin and peckin , For goodness sakes Bob turn on a light . <p> Sally ( Switzer ) Lasby <p> Hi Bob , Do you remember Taco Jiffy in Upland , I worked there when you owned it . Also I rented a house on Campus and 11th street from you before I purchased it in 1969 . John and I had two boys Daryl who is 40 this year and Danny who is 35 . We divorced in 1986 and he moved to Laughlin and said he saw you there . How is Marvin ? I live in Riverside now with my old high school sweetheart in a senior complex . E-mail me at bud and sally62@charter.net . Been a long time . Taco Jiffy is now Taco King on Foothill in Upland . Always , Sally ( Switzer ) Lasby <p> Pennie Bleil <p> I loved this site and remember everything you talked about . Does anyone remember the TownHouse on the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always drive through there on the weekend nites . Also Mels Burgers on Holt Ave . <p> Derek Christensen <p> As mentioned a few comments earlier , Yes , I remember dining at the Claremont restaurant known as " SOUPS ON at the DANISH KITCHEN , " located on the south side of Foothill , near the colleges . <p> It was a converted house . My parents liked to frequent the place ( along with Griswolds and " Indian Hills Restaurant " ) and brought me with them in the 1970s . <p> I remember " Delmonico Steak " on the menu . <p> Farther down Foothill , also on the south side in Claremont , was " TUGBOAT ANNIES . " The building architecture was in the shape of tugboat . Its still there but new name/ownership . <p> Pete Pearsall <p> I think the record shop was called Macs , was on 2nd St. west of Garey . South side of the street . <p> John <p> Old town Upland was a wonderful place with Upland Feed &amp; Fuel , Pearsons Jewelers ( Tut Pearsons place ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buned down ) , the coffee shop that let you keep your own coffee cup on the shelf ( theyd wash it and put it back when you left ) . <p> But of all the businesses that are no longer but in our memories is the one that made the town what it was , Central Market on the corner . <p> Joe Marks and Harold Speigel were brothers-in-law ; Joe was the meat man and gave every kid a choice of a " cold dog " or a slice of balogna to eat while mom got groceries . On the way to the register Cal Fifer , the produce manager , let the child choose one of several cookies he selected for that days treat . Cal Fifer was a sort of produce genius who was like a walking encyclopedia of fruit and vegetables . He introduced purple-meat potatoes ( that now would sell like hotcakes ) long before presentation was what it is now . The little grocery store also introduced Bumble Bee tuna and Ragu spaghetti sauce to the market . It closed in 1971 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare me ! <p> barbara hartley <p> Hi David , This is a great blog . Just a few things I remembered about Ontario from the late 50s . There were several great stores on Euclid , Bunnys , Eddie LeVines , Scotts Dept . Store , Butler Bros Dept Store , Musettes Ladies Store , Wights Jewelers , Fallis Mens Store , Eaders Bakery , Drew Carriage , The Bell and House Cafeteria . The Downtown Bowl ( where the Eagles is now located ) , Gordon Ayers Camera Shop on W. Holt , The Bootery and the Lemon House on Lemon between Holt and " B " Sts . And also Maggies . If you could n't find it in Ontario you probably could n't find it anywhere . <p> Barbara , welcome to this blog ! And thanks for the store names ; most of those are new names to this latecomer . DA <p> Dan Neuenschwander <p> Right next to the Eagles Lodge for a while in the 60s was Troy Ruttman Mini-Bikes ! <p> Michael Reich <p> When we first moved to California in 1963 my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restaurant located at San Bernardino Rd and Azusa Ave in Covina . Is the Northwoods Inn now located where the Dinnerhorn once stood ? Thanks . <p> I do n't  know , but someone must . DA <p> Rodger Lilley <p> Yes , that is where Northwoods is now located . Anyone know when the Dinnerhorn opened ? <p> Charles Bentley <p> GREETINGS : I believe that is correct . I do n't  know when the change was made , but I 'm pretty sure that the Dinnerhorn was where the Northwoods Inn is now . <p> Can someone else help with this was n't the Dinnerhorn Restaurant at one time affiliated with the Sycamore Inn ? I believe they were under the same **30;67;TOOLONG or something . As I recall there was a connection between the two ( and several other restaurants in the region ) . <p> Bob House <p> I saw an old Dinnerhorn matchbook on Flickr with the " Azusa Ave . at San Bernardino Rd. " address . <p> Also see a 2007 post on Davids blog " Clearmans , Golly . " I learned here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was originally a Clearmans operation too . <p> Judy Chambers <p> I remember The Magic Lamp , I 'm pretty sure we ate there several times but I cant remember where it was . <p> Gary <p> Still there Several locations , one on grove and foothill just before you enter Rancho Cucamonga <p> JMac <p> Today marks the start of the 50th anniversary running of the Winternationals . But that is not what this post will be about . In his latest blog posting , National Dragster editor Phil Burgess has a nice little story of the family who leased the El Merendero prior to them . It includes a few pics . <p> Does anyone remember the Mayfair Market on foothill blvd in Rancho Cucamonga ? I believe it opened in 1957 , I was just 4 but remember the grand opening . It was quite different back then , I would say better judging by the looks of the neighborhood now . I remember a lot of rural areas . <p> carmel mcqueen <p> Yes , I remember Mayfair Market , I was 6 years when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to Central School <p> Handsome Package <p> I think that became Perrys Market and now its home to Autozone <p> John <p> I moved to San Dimas from El Monte in 1963 . I remember Henrys Drive Thru on Foothill &amp; Garey in Pomona . It was torn down a few years later . Do any of you " Old Timers " remember the " Hilltop Teen Club " at the old Mountain Meadows Golf Course across the street from the LA County Fairgrounds ? Great place to go if you liked to dance AND fight ! <p> Who recalls the " POSH " night club in Pomona on Towne near Arrow Hwy ? I watched it burn down in 1969 . What a blaze that was ! ! ! Rumor has it a competitor torched it . <p> How about the old UA Theater in downtown Pomona , or the Fox across the street ? Back in my old hometown I watched The Beatles perform at the El Monte Legion Stadium in 1964 . <p> Old timer here , John . I remember well Henrys Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UA Theater and the Fox . Also used to go to a dance club on Holt Blvd in Pomona called The Broadside . Did you ever go there or to The Test on N. White Ave . in Pomona ? I followed a band called Decembers Children . I was in lust with their bass guitar player . G Sounds like we went to the same places . I would n't be surprised if we knew each other . lol I see your post here was 4 years ago , so I wont really expect a response . The memories are fun , anyway . I 'm attending my 50th class reunion for Pomona High next month . Time just flies . <p> John Clifford <p> Gee and you did n't  book a tour of the restored Fox ? As president of Friends of the Fox I 've done a couple of high school reunions over the past few years . <p> Since I grew up in the Azusa-Glendora area , I did n't  get to Pomona that often , but was familiar with a lot of the places as wed drive through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , you get a quick response . Of course , I 'm not that same John , but . . . <p> Don Canada <p> I remember attending the Fox Theater with my mom and dad in the forties . It was just beautiful . Had tapestries on the walls and a big organ with a white haired fellow playing before , during intermission and after the movies . Was just beautiful . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> Yes , The Broadside on Holt . There was also The Test by the fairgrounds . That may have gone onto become The Posh . I moved to Newport Beach in the late 60s and had gone with a date to a bar in either Seal Beach or Surfside , just south of Long Beach on Coast Highway and who was behind the bar ? Skip , who used to own The Broadside . What a nice surprise . He and George Encell were co-owners . George had the premature gray hair and used to ask me out but I never dated him . He was a little too old for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was also The Red Flame next to Taco Lita across from The Broadside but we had to use false I 'd to go there . We finally got caught and got asked to leave . Embarrassing but not before I and a Pomona cop won first place in their Saturday night dance contest . Ca n't remember his name but he was good looking and blond . <p> Candace Tremayne Montoya <p> I remember the Posh but there also was a dance place that was on the second floor , up the wooden stairs , on white but I do n't  remember the name of it , do you ? <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> That was The Test . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> I remember all of them . Henrys was knocked down in the mid 80s and I happened to be driving by when it was almost all done . It was fenced off and all that was left was rubble . I was mortified ! I parked , jumped out of my car and asked the guy on the bull dozier to stop ! He stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th person who had stopped and shouted at him . He was actually very nice . I told him about my cruising days going to Henrys about how on Friday nights , it would take half an hour to get to the driveway from way down on Garey but only five minutes to cruise slowly through to see who was there . Hot caramel sundaes and onion rings . That 's what I would order every single time . I still have the card that was put on the windshield with instructions about putting ones headlights on for service and on the other side , Chicken-in-the-Rough , which was their specialty . I never had it . <p> As I was walking away , he asked me if I wanted a souvenir from Henrys and suggested I look at a pile of rubble that had n't  been hauled off . He said there was one piece of metal from the kitchen that actually had " Henrys " written on it with a grease pencil but it was perfectly legible . <p> Of cocurse , I took it and still have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urinal laying a few feet a away that I should have also taken . Understand I was involved in every one of my class reunions except for our 5 year reunion . I attended but was n't on the committee because I lived in Newport Beach and it was too far for me to go tot he meetings . <p> Just think , I could have made the urinal the centerpiece of the memorabilia table and asked how many guys attending the reunion might have peed in that very urinal it back in 1962 ? <p> Yup , the Broadside with Skip and George , the owners ; The Posh and the Test . I loved the band that was at The Test for a long time : " Where Its At " was their name with Eddie Carmel , the singer , a gorgeous guy with curly hair who was a great dance while he danced . He had a baby face and baby blue eyes . So cute . My favorite was when he sang the Sir Douglas Quintets song " The Rains Came " but did it slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fabulous . I think he was married to one of the cocktail waitresses . I understood that Eddie got heavily into drugs and that was such a shame because that boy had talent , looks and charisma on stage for miles . Sad . <p> I went to Bonita High in La Verne just up the road but had a lot of friends from Pomona : Pomona High , Ganesha and Pomona Catholic . 20357 @qwx640357 <p> At least you tried to save Henrys ( and 14 others before you ) . Posterity thanks you for your efforts . You may know this already , but there are two or three blog posts here about Henrys , complete with photos . Use the search function and check em out if you have n't . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> Someone mentioned the car hops at Henrys were on roller skates . Not so . No rollar skates . I also remember one of the " Rent-a-Cops " at Henrys was " Smitty " . Ca n't remember the other one . There were two who worked there . Smitty was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind . The second " Rent-a-Cop " had a mustache but his names escapes me . Yup , the guys would gather in the parking lot across the street . I think there was a big grocery store there . Anyway , often the drag races would be discussed there then everyone would drive to Baseline east of Claremont . I only went once because the cops would usually get word and we did n't  want to be caught for just being in the area . We loved Henrys . There were four main drive ins that were famous in S. Calif. : Bobs Big Boy in Pasadena , Harveys Broiler in Downey ( I was never there ) , Scribners in Hollywood ( not there either but I listened to Art Laboe who did his shows from thereand Henrys in Pomona which was , by far , the most beautiful . <p> Rod <p> OReillys had the best chicken and burgers in Ontario And the best fresh pies Ray and Millie were wonderful folks and fed us = like we was kings and Queens A top notch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Long Beach in the late 40s ? My mother worked there , and I 'm trying to find out a little information about the place I have some photographs of the front of the place , but cant find anything about it . <p> Thanks ! <p> Bob House <p> Hi Julie , <p> I found an ad for Phonotel Co. in Long Beach in a 1947 Long Beach Police Department publication . Address was 557 Atlantic in Long Beach today its the location of Louies Burgers . <p> Phonotel was an interesting old service . Jukeboxes , equipped with phones ( but not records ) , were installed in public places and linked by telephone lines to a central office . To play a selection , you picked up the phone and told the operator what you wanted to hear . The operator would go over to a phonograph linked to your locations jukebox , place your record selection on a turntable in her office and you would hear the music through the speaker on the jukebox in your location through the phone line . <p> In a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a single central office with a separate phonograph for each jukebox . As complicated and convoluted as it sounds , that was high tech in the music business of the 40s . I 've seen references to other Phonotel operations in Fresno and Portland , OR . <p> Bob , you continue to amaze me . I 'm emailing Julie so she knows to check back to look for your response . DA <p> Scott <p> Trappers Inn in La Habra . I believe it was on Harbor Blvd . <p> Tom Shirk <p> I was stationed at both General Dynamics plants in Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga in 87 88 and remember both Saritas on Holt in Pomona and the Red Hill Cafe on Foothill as my favorite restaurantsI miss the old times with great friends back then ! Cheers ! <p> Ted Ellenhorn <p> Ah . My father was at GD and I remember those places well <p> Barbara Rhode-Mullins Eubanks <p> Man I wish I had some recipes from Saritas , especially for their enchilada sauce and the kind of cheese that they used.I could make a fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is all about .. I have been able to duplicate some of the recipes .. but if you run across the enchilada sauce .. LET ME HAVE IT .. PLEASE : ) <p> Dennis <p> Oh , I , too , would like recipes from Saritas not only the enchilada sauce but the actual enchilada recipe . Their cheese enchiladas were the best Ive ever had ! Although not a dish I was fond of , I understand their chili rellanos were the best anywhere by all the friends I referred to this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant . Happily I did find a recipe for their signature dessert , almondrado . <p> For a time I was working at Ruffings School Music Supply on Garey Ave. , north of HOlt . I had only 30 minutes for lunch so called Saritas in hopes of being able to eat in so short a time at the lunchtime hour . They apparently recognized my voice because when I arrived my table was set and the food was ready to eat . <p> I grew up in Chino and one of my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riverside Drive and 15th Street ( now Benson Avenue ) . Behind the restaurant were a number of small shops including a barber ( B.K. ) who cut my hair . I was flabbergasted when I was in my late teens to have B.K. lead me to the back of the shop to see a clipping from the Chino Champion ( maybe the Progress Bulletin ? ) featuring me and two of my neighborhood friends getting haircuts when we were children . <p> Then there was the feed store on the corner of Riverside Drive and Oaks Street ( southeast corner ) , where we could buy penny candy on our way to and from El Rancho Elementary School , now closed . <p> And Chino also had an A&amp;W Drive-in Restaurant on Riverside Drive and I remember we would buy root beer in a gallon glass jug that could be refilled . I believe its a Mexican fast food place now . <p> Xochimilkos Mexican restaurant in Pomona ( corner of Indian Hill and Holt ) also had some good Mexican food . <p> The first " multiplex " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Hill . I saw Doctor Zhivago there , thoroughly blown away with the seats that tilted ! ! <p> Robbies Disco in Pomona on 2nd Street was where I met my partner of 27 years while attending a concert by Debbie Jacobs , most famous for the song Undercover Lover . We later saw performances there by Gloria Gaynor , Cheryl Lynn , The Weather Girls , and Boystown Gang . <p> My late first wife was a wonderful pianist . Sue could play anything . During high school ( PHS 1970-72 ) , we attended First Baptist Church ( corner of Gary and Holt ) . Frequently , whenever we walked or took the bus to First Baptist , we stopped at Ruffings Music , a store that she liked quite a lot . Whenever I had money , I would buy her a new piece of sheet music . Mostly classical , and a lot of showtunes ; once , to my great delight , we also discovered the sheet music for the main theme from Patton , a favorite of mine . <p> I remember noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sisters wedding a few years back . It was one of several disappointing disappearances , including the that of the Shakeys Pizza Parlor near the corner of Gary and La Verne ( it was a Mexican restaurant when I drove by ) . It is where I got my first ( and fifth ) jobs . I started out doing washing up in the kitchen and mopping out the place after everyone else was gone ; I was graduated to " skin man " ( the guy who stands in front of the dining room windows rolling the pizza dough ) after our previous skin man came to work drunk one night and rolled his hand . <p> I was working at Shakeys for most of the time that Sue was pregnant . During that pregnancy , she developed a craving for anchovy pizza . We took phone orders , and after they were cooked , they were placed on top of the ovens to keep them warm . If there were any still up there when we closed , the employees got to take them home . Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , somehow , there was always a large anchovy pizza still sitting up there when we closed whenever I was working . She always thought it was really sweet of them . <p> Amusingly , but perhaps not surprisingly , once our son was born , she was never interested in getting near and anchovy pizza for the rest of her life . <p> Judy Chambers <p> I remember Shakeys Pizza . I lived just a short distance from there on Deodar Rd . <p> Ted Ellenhorn <p> Isnt that the Shakeys that legend reports that Frank Zappa and his father would buy dough there and then put peanut butter and whatever on top and made a business out of that ? <p> Well , that is what I heard . <p> In any event , we used to go there after Claremont and Damien football games . The salad bar and big pitchers of coke were the best ! <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> Saritas across from Pomona Catholic is where I discovered tacos made with flour tortillas . I still make them that way today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly crying up much faster then corn tortillas . Try them ! <p> Our employee , Lucky White , built the Rotabar , the only rotating bar in Southern California , in the Dinnerhorn Restaurant on Azusa in Covina . Lucky also created the " star " that appeared on top of the Eastland Mall in Covina , CA . <p> I have researched all that I am able , and have not found anything in the Covina Argus or from Google . <p> Can you help me with any information about these 2 creations ? <p> Lucky White worked for Valencia Heights Water Company ( VHWC ) and the company is celebrating its 100th Anniversary . His wife ( 89 years old ) still works for VHWC and I would love to honor her husband at a staff dinner at the old Dinnerhorn , now Clearmans Northwoods Inn , October 17 , 2012 . <p> Can you help ? <p> I would appreciate any information that you could share . <p> Thank you . <p> Shelly B. <p> What restaurant was on the corner of Euclid and Foothill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter there . The city was Upland . 20357 @qwx640357 <p> The Stuft Shirt , and later The Arbor , were on that corner . <p> Shelly B. <p> Thank you so much ! ! <p> Diana Manny <p> Betsy Ross on Foothill Blvd before Mountain in Claremont . It was a coffee shop ice cream palor . They had the best sundaes with these awesome wafer cookies on the side . I think it became a real estate office later on . I remember the Disco on Foothill and Garey . My parents went there in the 70s . Griswalds had a great Santa breakfast every year and their candy shop and bakery was the best . Greens Deli , the owners were so nice . I think my parents had a tab there . I would eat lung there and put it on my parents house account . What about the Point up the hill going to Baldy ? Everyone in high school used to drive up there and climb back in . They called it the carpet too since someone put a huge carpet up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there anymore since they developed homes up there . Craft Design in the Village and AKline chocolatiers . I loved both of those places . The Tastee Bagel on Foothill . Loved their bagels . What was the name of the grocery store in the Claremont Village ? <p> Yes , I remember the Betsy Ross Coffee Shop on Foothill Boulevard in Claremont , as well as the Betsy Ross Coffee Shop on Grand Avenue in Glendora . Both places where visited frequently during my youth ( my parents and I went to the Glendora restaurant more since it was closer to us ) . <p> My father would proclaim with staunch belief that the two best ice creams in the world came from Thriftys ( triple scoop cone ) and Betsy Ross ( chocolate sundae ) . My mother enjoyed the food more at Betsy Ross , and was content with a single scoop of vanilla ice cream at the end of her meal . <p> As for myself , I was a local favorite at the Glendora Betsy Ross . When the waitresses saw me coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be.a Patty Melt with Fries , and for dessert , four scoops of Black Licorice Ice Cream . That ice cream must have had heroin in it , because I was addicted to it . I went through withdrawals for that gooey ice cream every week . Sure , the ice cream looked like an oil slick , but it tasted so damn good . And yes , most of the patrons and employees would stare at me as I wolfed down the ice cream like a fattened pig . <p> Sadly , as we all know , Betsy Ross closed down . In fact , my parents and I were somewhat shocked because we never heard the staff say anything about , and we were there every week or two . Just one day we drove up to have dinner and ice cream , and saw it was closed . Like I said , we were a bit shocked . <p> Alas , such memories are bittersweet , for my parents are gone now , and pretty much all that is left are the images that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can remember . Someone mentions Betsy Ross , and I remember sitting in a booth , shoveling spoonfuls of Black Licorice Ice Cream into my mouth , looking across the table to see my dad laughing at me while my mom shook her head and said " I do n't  know how you can eat that " . <p> It was an enjoyable moment , but sadly , one that could not last forever . <p> I miss Betsy Ross Coffee Shop , as much as the many places from my youth that are no longer here . <p> But most of all , I miss my mom and dad . <p> Rick <p> There was also a Betsy Ross at the Pomona Valley Center at Indian Hill ( Alexander Ave ) and Holt . I worked at Nashs Department Store PVC in 1969 and at Sears Pomona in the early 70s . Newberrys at the Pomona Valley Center had a lunch counter . Newberrys also had the best popcorn . When I was in elementary school and got my allowance , I would walk from our house at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newberrys popcorn . Of course , the Pomona Valley Center does n't  exist anymore . <p> Henrys at Garey and Foothill : my older sister met her future husband there . He had recently graduated from Pomona Catholic Boys High School , or as it was called back then , " PC " , and my sister from Montclair High . When I was a freshman at Montclair , 1964-65 , I went to the Backwards Dance with a senior . We went to Henrys after the dance . <p> Jared Malan <p> Bentleys <p> Judy Chambers <p> I went to Betsey Ross many times and met my first husband at Griswalds <p> Billy E. Settle <p> Carrolls restaurant on Foothill blvd . Pomona , was a Bobs Big Boy when I moved to La Verne in 1978 , Can you give me the year it became Carrolls ? Thank You D.A . 20357 @qwx640357 <p> You mean Carrows ? No idea , sorry , although Im glad to know that used to be a Bobs ! <p> Judy Dixon Gabaldon <p> I love Carrows . A bit off topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they 're all something else ( TGIF , or whatever ) . I still go to Carrows whenever we go to Rialto ( not too far from Pomona ) . <p> beatleboo <p> There 's a very nice Carrows on N. Mountain in Upland , just below Arrow Hwy . <p> Judy Dixon Gabaldon <p> I remember an outdoor theater located somewhere around Ontario or Upland . It was called ( something ) Gardens . I saw both Ray Charles and James Brown there in the mid 60s . Anyone else remember that venue ? 20357 @qwx640357 <p> Well , there was Royal Tahitian in Ontario , where both those guys performed ( search on my blog for pictures ) , and which had an outdoor performance area . Pomona had Rainbow Gardens , which I think was indoors . <p> Judy Dixon Gabaldon <p> That might have been it , David , but how in the world I came up with " Gardens " as part of the name , I have no idea . That does sound vaguely familiar . Thank you so much . P.S. Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included with your blog , I now do n't  feel so stupid and " off the mark " with my memory of " gardens " in the name . I see in one ad , it said , " Royal Tahitian Concert Gardens " I feel redeemed . ( LOL ) . <p> beatleboo <p> The Royal Tahitian rocked ! I saw James Brown there several times . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> I saw James Brown there too ! We had a little table directly in front of the stage . I went with Lennis , my boyfriend of many years . Brown put on a fantastic show . <p> beatleboo <p> I remember the Rainbow Gardens ! It was a dance hall . Wasnt it across the street from the YMCA on Garey Ave ? <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> No but close . It was off Garey just south of Holt going . There was a huge class ball over the dance floor . It burned down and people said it was definitely arson . Too bad . It was a nice place and well maintained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others at The Rainbow Gardens . We used to go to teen dances there often . It was beautiful . At least to us compared to the after game dances at the Y on Garey in Pomona . I think those were in the gym . All the area high schools in the Pomona Valley attended . ( Bonita HS 62 ) I remember the lady who owned the Rainbow Gardens . She was always dressed to the max . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> My boyfriend , Lennis and I saw James Brown at the Royal Tahitian . I believe it was on Riversdie Dr. just west of Archibald . We had a tiny little table five ft. from the stage . That was before big stars had concerts and one could be up close to the stage and almost touch the performers . <p> Roxanne , nice list , and I liked seeing a few 21st century restaurants on it . While I 'd heard of most on your list , Brighams and Olvers were new ones to me . Lastly , did you know there 's still a Donahoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohms <p> Do you recall a chicken ranch on Arrow hwy and Benson I think it was ? , it had a ranch home out front and at the rear of the driveway an egg store that usually was not manned but had a coffee can sitting on the counter next to flats of eggs . It was across from a Mobile home park which came after the ranch however I still recall them fighting about the flies and the smells , in fact the owner , Mike Rossitter , My Stepmothers father became a city councilman as a result of their heated battles . The egg ranches are gone now , at least that one is , he had Sunshine eggs plant nearby I forgot where now . <p> Vicki Porto <p> Oh my goodness , we used to go to that egg ranch . Had to be mid60s . I grew up on Deborah Ct . <p> Judy Chambers <p> The A&amp;W Root Beer place on Foothill was a regular stop for my brother &amp; I. Anybody remember the Orange Julius stand not far from there ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Claremont , was the first place I remember stopping in this area . My cross country team had drinks there in fall 1973 . Little did I know I would be living in the area 5 years later . <p> Roxanne Basica <p> David Brighams is where Mora Japanese Steakhouse is now . It was Kings Buffet for a while Olivers was great steaks &amp; seafood on the level &amp; style of Cask &amp; Cleaver . Some rumor about the chef or owner disgruntled and lighting a matchMaybe Daily Bulletin has real story . Donahoos at 4th &amp; Grove is still open ? I thought just the sign is up I worked at Alpha Beta Grocery @ 4th &amp; Grove in the 70s when it closed owner died I always see the sign there when I go to Halgrens Candy but I never see the security gate open for business Donahoos is open &amp; busy on Garey in Pomona . <p> Dan Neuenschwander <p> Gene and Maureen Smith owned Olivers in the late 70s to early 80s . I knew them from church , and they had mentioned they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of came back for revenge . Of course there was always the rumor it was they who set the fire to get insurance money but rumors are usually that rumors . I think In-N-Out sits on the property now . I used to work at the Instant Burger next to the New China ( the old Sage Hen ) on Foothill &amp; Central back in the 70s . My , have times changed just a bit . <p> Judy Chambers <p> Wow , cant tell you how often we ate at the Sage Hen . I would n't have remembered the name until you reminded me . I was only about 3 when we started going there . <p> Gary <p> Sage Hen was awesome according to my parents I was too you . Building is still there but it is a different restaurant <p> I have been trying to no avail to find any information or photos of the old Fosters Freeze that was on the corner of Garey Ave and W. Willow St. in Pomona CA . It was right on the corner in the shopping center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha Beta Market were . I know it was there . I lived at 227 E. Willow St. across from Pomona Valley Hospital , which is now a parking lot . In the late 50s and 60s I used to walk to Fosters Freeze and buy the best lemon slush that has ever existed . Nothing like it can be found anywhere now . Believe me , I 've looked ! What I 'm really looking for is a picture of the Fosters Freeze . Can anyone help me , please ? <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> No photos but I remember Fosters Freeze well and ate a lot of sundaes there . <p> bruce w. baker <p> I remember back in the 60. s , &amp; 70s some Frosty or Fosters Freezes , &amp; Fosters Donuts . Both not far from P. V. Hospital . Also both on Alosta in Glendora. ca .. Also remember a Frosty or Fosters Freeze on Foothill in La Canada ca . Also a Henrys restaurant followed by a Conrads , &amp; presently a Hill Street or Hill Top cafe . This all at the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I also totally miss The Ponderosa restaurant followed by the Polo Club then a fancy new Sizzler Steak House now torn down for a chicken place near A P U .. Sometimes progress just sucks ! <p> Debbie Johnson <p> Does anyone remembehamburger place called Arrow Burgers ? in covina/azusa ? ( Not sure ) On arrow hwy of course anyway I was wondering who was owner.was her name Lil Mayme and was her last name Vogt ? My mother used to work there in about 1955 56 or/and 1957 <p> Rose Ruiz <p> Does anyone remember what year the pop n taco was closed down ? The one of the corner of Arrow Hwy and Cerritos in Azusa CA ? <p> My mom used to get pizza from there , it was the best pizza around . Still have n't tasted one as good since . Its now a Juan Pollo Chicken <p> Candace Tremayne Montoya <p> There was a teen hangout at Foothill near Central called Stinkys it was a rock structure . There was Jade Palace on Holt in Montclair ib the 60s that was sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Centraljust north of the Freeway That had a live band club area in it . The Stuft Shirt restaurant corner of Euclid and Holt in Upland . <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> I remember them well . The Stuff Shirt was very upscale for back then . <p> Louie Ramos <p> Hi does any one remember the bar driftwood in. on benson and foothill which is now a janitor business they had great cheeseburgers <p> Suzanne Castillo Devlin <p> More then anything , I remember Henrys . The line to just drive through usually went all the way back down Garey south of Foothill . It would take 10 minutes just to get to the driveway to cruise through the drive in area then back in line again and again . People used to come from Pasadena , Burbank , Downey , LA and everywhere to cruise Henrys . It was the most beautiful drive-in in Southern California . Hot caramel sundaes and onion rings and " Chicken in the Rough " , as it was called ! ! ! <p> Estaben Calabacas <p> I belive Stinkys was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of Garey and Garfield Avenues , in Pomona . Few people even remember it existed . Dr. William Stahl and his wife Bobbi , an RN , owned ran it . <p> Mark Jones <p> Boy , I remember that hospital . I was born there . <p> MelanieR <p> I was too ! <p> Judy Chambers <p> Wow , Dr. Stahl was my Dr. I was in that hospital several times . He took my appendix out in that hospital . My best friends mother who lived across the street from us was an RN at Dr. Stahls Hosp . <p> MelanieR <p> I wonder if it was the same nurse who was my moms friend , too ? I want to say her name was Betty Tremaine . <p> Bruce N. Wheelock <p> Number one on my list of " things that are n't  there anymore " is Valley Community Theatre . <p> When I was first exposed to VCT , it was an old church on San Antonio near Holt . In 1970 , my 10th grade Drama Teacher at PHS , John Alberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Smell of the Crowd " there . The next show was " Harvey , " for which I ran sound and music . <p> That location of VCT is where I briefly got involved with the first girl I ever kissed . We used to make out in the lighting booth during performances of " Harvey , " while scenes were running . <p> After " Harvey " closed , VCT moved to the old Moose Lodge on the second floor of the building that is across Garey Avenue from the Fox theater . The floor had been vacated after the Pomona Police Department raided the Moose Lodge and busted the poker room before they could hide the money . The lodge was shut down , and the floor was available for us to rent at a price we could afford . <p> The next year I met my future wife in the Drama Department at Pomona High School . We did " Inherit the Wind , " and a beautiful senior named Susan McKnight played my wife . <p> Our first date was at the Fox theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patton " and " MASH . " Not the most romantic of movies , perhaps , but we were both deeply enmeshed in theatre , and everyone had heard about what great acting there was in those two films . <p> In 1971 , VCT did " Carousel . " Sue and I ran lights together for that show . In the light booth during a performance one night , while the lengthy ballet sequence in the second act was going , I suddenly asked her to marry me . She cried . She said yes . <p> Later , after I enlisted in the Navy and we went off to Norfolk , VCT moved to what had been a grocery store in the mall at the foot of Indian Hill Boulevard , at the opposite end of the mall from the Sears store . My father became the sort of theatre electrician when they were designing and putting together a lighting system . <p> At some point after that , VCT closed , vanishing forever . I 've never known why . But it was gone . Sigh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claremont ? It still had the little devil on the sign . <p> RichardPietrasz <p> Yes . My cross country team stopped there the first time I was ever in Claremont in 1973 . <p> Ted Ellenhorn <p> I grew up a few blocks from thereloved that place <p> Don Canada <p> Anyone on this thread have any idea when Betsy Ross closed in Covina ? Better still , anyone have pictures of Betsy Ross in Covina . <p> Gary G. <p> Does anybody remember back in the 50s and 60s on the corner of San Bernardino Rd. and foothill in Rancho Cucamonga a drive-through hamburger stand shaped like a circus clowns hat ? After they tore it down and 8-track stereo shop was built for automobiles . It was just across the street from the sycamore inn and a quarter car wash on the other side . Now its just dirt.and are there any pictures of that drive-through hamburger stand ? <p> Robin credico <p> Gary I think your referring to Grinder Haven on Holt west of San Antonio or DeGanges farther west on holt maybe on mission .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking bread the same maybe new owners . Will check it out . In the 60s my mom took us there when she needed a break . Henrys another favorite .. my father would only take us to DiCentos supper house on foothill other haunt of his was " Casa De Mayo " on 9th St now called the Cask and Clever . My dad was also food and beverage mgr of the most night spot in Ontario " THE ROYAL TAHITION " on Whispering Lakes Gulf Course . Headliners , luau s , , as a kid my brothers , friends and I had a ball .. endless cocktail onions and olives .. one more question to you David Allen ( I remember you from school ) . do you recall little italian deli owned by " THE LECORES " ? Holt and Indian hill Pollichillis ? ? ? ? ? 20357 @qwx640357 <p> You actually do n't  know me from school I did n't  grow up here . Sorry ! I 'm not familiar with the deli you mention . As for the Royal Tahitian , you might search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times . <p> Denise Hebrank <p> I remember Pollicellis ! My dad would take us there to get Italian lunchmeats . I learned to LOVE mortadella with pistachios and what I called " greasy pepper thin salami " Oh my ! The memories ! <p> Mark Jones <p> Sounds like Ricks GoGo burgers . I grew up on red hill , and ate at Ricks often . Not because it was good , but in those days ( 60s-70s ) there was n't anything else around . Darn I miss the good old Cucamonga ! <p> Gary <p> Anyone remember Tonys Beef Dip in Pomona , I think it was on 4th street near the City of Pomona yards . Red and white checked table cloths and saw dust on the floorthe pickles were the best 20357 @qwx640357 <p> But Gary , Tonys is still around ! Second Street , red-checked tablecloths , pickles , all of it . There are a couple of posts on this blog about it . <p> Gary <p> Wow . I read most of the blogs , must have missed thatthanks . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating burritos that my parents boughtwe lived in Pomona off of Jefferson by Lincoln Park , , , , , that were made of shredded beef , white cheese , and a flour tortilla . The tortilla was cooked with little black spots on it when over a flame , the juice from the beef was incredibly savory , and the tortilla shell would almost become translucent from the juice on it . You could get it with sour cr+me , but mostly we had them without . Any ideas where this might have been or still is ? Also I remember that they were wrapped in aluminum foil with one extra white paper wrapping on the inside of the foil . I would ask my parents , but they are gone , , , 20357 @qwx640357 <p> Do you mean Juanitas on Indian Hill ? If so , that 's still there too , and I 've posted about it on this blog as well , just like Tonys . If not , then I do n't  know . <p> Richard Castillo <p> Agreed David . Gary , this has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Ellenhorn <p> What was the name of the place across from the old Montclair Theater ? Not the big dance place , but a small lunch shop just east of the theater . Amazing burritos with huge chilies in the middle . I worked at the Montclair from 1975-1981 . <p> The earliest Sambos here was on Indian Hill Blvd in Claremont ; it was joined by ones in Chino and La Verne . They were all gone by 1985 . <p> Rrralph <p> The Dennys on Central Ave &amp; 60 in Chino , as I recall as a kid , was a Sambos . I think a lot of Dennys were Sambos first . <p> Judy Chambers <p> I thought that became Dennys to be Politically correct . <p> Gary <p> I think Dennys bought them but I saw one in Santa Barbata last year but all of the characters were taken down <p> bruce w. baker <p> I have n't read every post here , maybe 25 of them so far ! I was expecting to read about the Old Hickory Inn in Glendora which now is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66 , &amp; Lone Hill ! The nearby Woodshed bar is a Mac Donalds , &amp; a auto repair shop . The always packed Ponderosa restaurant was my favorite restaurant ever , it was on Alosta , &amp; Citrus . Then came the Polo Club , then that beautifull building was torn down for a fancy Sizzler also always with a waiting line . Then it gets torn down too ! I hear it was because A P U College wanted their chicken without beer ! <p> Pam Daniels Wilson <p> Does anyone remember the name of the dance club in Fontana CA that was located on Sierra Ave close to Kaiser Hospital during the late 1980s 1987 ? <p> TERESA <p> yes , it was called El Castillo " s . Now its a dentist . Do you recall a club in Pomona called Grand Central Station on Holt . <p> 4hmnrghts <p> Omg , Grand Central Station ! I could n't remember the name of it . My friends and I used to go every weekend because it was a 16 and over club , no alcohol allowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call it ! Only went there a couple of times before they changed the name to " New Image " ( I think ) . The club I enjoyed the most was in Upland called , " Seventh Street " . I believe all of these clubs , and others , were owned by two guys named Ron and Steve . I went dancing with my friends , to these clubs , every chance I got ( including school nights ) . I lived in Upland and was too young to drive , but we always found a way to get to Pomona to go dancing ! What fun and crazy memories ! <p> Steven L Heal <p> Anybody remember bakers taco on the azusa Avenue near Valley Boulevard is it related anyway to the Bakers drive-through they have now <p> Rrralph <p> I 'm from Chino , and there 's been loads of changes in the city over the years . These are some of the places that I recall from my childhood that were taken down in the 80s/90s . Downtown : 1 . The old meat processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking through the alley behind the plant and seeing the sides of beef hanging from hooks , and the smell . Very unique smell . 2. 6th St The old narrow movie theater . I remember my dad taking me on Saturday afternoons . I saw reruns of movies like " Them " the giant ants . It later was turned into a army surplus that lasted a few years . 3 . The tea house/cafe where the older Chino folks ( mostly older ladies ) would go for small sandwiches and coffee . I never went in there . 4 . Foodland , which moved around the corner onto D st about 2006 , and still has the same owners from about 35 years ago . A Chinese couple . 5 . Tom Mcann shoe store . My mom would take me there for shoes . 6 . A western gear store . I remember a big fiberglass horse in the front window . 7 . Herbs Hardware . I remember all kinds of old neat things up on the walls when I 'd go in with my dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2005. 8 . The " Copa " bar . A rowdy place . There was a bunch more on 6th street but cant recall anymore except for a dentist I believe . 9 . Mcleans Stationary on D st . ( Now Foodland uses this space ) . I almost forgot , when I was about 9 , I was walking with my two aunts past a metal side door of Mcleans located in the alley . Just as I walked by the metal door , Mr. Mclean busted through the door and knocked the heck out of me the door hit my head . My aunts panicked and were yelling at Mr. Mclean . I remember feeling a bit woozy , and Mr. Mclean apologizing . I felt bad for Mr. Mclean because of how mad my aunts were with him . <p> This whole area of 6th street was razed to make a small park and Senior housing . The building the former Herbs Hardware exists was the concrete First National Bank originally and will probably remain as a downtown attraction of what Chino used to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D st that are pretty old . <p> Michelle <p> I was born in Los Angeles many years ago . My family went every year to a place called Monte Vista Lodge I believe on Euclid Street in I believe Ontario . It was like the Catskills on the East Coast . What happened to it and what is at that site now . I have many happy memories of our weeks there . <p> Patriot Ray <p> I lived in Glendora California in the late 1950s and early 1960s went to Williams Elementary school . During that time around the Christmas season there was a hill just off route 66 Foothill Blvd. that I remember as either Christmas Hill , Santa Claus Hill or Holiday Hill . Does anyone have any information or remember it ? <p> Judy Chambers <p> I remember the place but not the name for sure . <p> RichardPietrasz <p> The only hill I can think of that meets that description is Redhill in Cucamonga . I do not recall any of the names you mentioned . <p> Found my way here looking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rima and I began our tradition of the waiters glass wed order a bottle of wine with dinner and request that the waiter set a third glass never had to ask twice until we tried to introduce Los Angeles restaurants to the idea . At LC we never had to look for a waiter . <p> Several of us attended the closing of the Crystal Cafeteria in Pomona , one of Bill Russells favorite places . ( Bill was the chairman of the music department at Pomona College . ) Shortly thereafter , a Cajun place opened up a block away run by a long-haul trucker who brought his own supplies in from Louisiana . <p> Rex , whose real name was impossibly long , came from Thailand to study at Claremont Graduate School , then stayed to become a restaurateur . He had a place a bit west of Griswolds and was respected for his immoderate ( read " authentic " ) use of chilies . Near him was a butcher who sold the best meat Ive ever found , like two-inch-thick veal escalopes that could make anyone seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop on Yale , was owned by an Afghan when I lived there . He served not only the classic American menu but biryani , pakora , and homemade yoghurt as well . <p> For a time , several disused railroad cars had been converted into a theme restaurant whose name escapes me on a siding in eastern Claremont , perhaps ? that Joop de Ruiter became addicted to . Joop was the organ-builder sent out by the Flentrop factory in Holland to install a chamber organ at the colleges . When he was n't cursing at his pipes in Dutch , he was rounding up yet another group to go " eat at the train " . <p> Ron Mittino , a social-studies teacher from Upland , opened La Piccoletta back in my day , probably 1977 , using his mothers recipes from Le Marche . I think he said that he inherited the medieval refectory motif from the previous tenants . Mamma even helped in the kitchen at first , until he brought Enzo in as sous-chef and ultimately sold the place to Enzo round about 1980 . Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freak accident while visiting family in Milan . <p> The Pyrenees in Chino was another restaurant known for trestle tables and family-style service . Very popular with the local Basque community . Havent seen its like since . 20357 @qwx640357 <p> Jorge : Lots of great comments , thanks .

It in fact was a popular hangout for then-La Verne College students , so much so that the decision was made to move it to Foothill &amp; D Street in La Verne , a far better location . <p> Ann M. Adam <p> Mountain &amp; Foothill would have been in Upland unless they 've moved the city boundaries . I think that Monte Vista now is the boundary of Upland &amp; Montclair at Foothill .

It was located between 177 and 176st and Broadway . It was a restaurant/bar with two arcades : asteroid and centipide . It had THE most delicious crispy fried chicken I have ever tasted . It would come in a basket and you could order pork fried rice to have with it . It was the best Chinese food Ive ever had . I used to go there a lot when I was a child .

The " Final Destination " series of movies proved that when people try to alter their sealed fate , death just comes up with another creative way of carrying out its master plan . <p> Using the research lab to find ways of postponing a visit by the Grim Reaper is always a ripe theme for the " science gone bad " element of horror and science fiction films . <p> The latest movie to deal with laboratory experiments designed to reverse death is " The Lazarus Effect , " which starts out promising but eventually derails . <p> " Lazarus " has a similar set up as " Deep Blue Sea " in that a driven group of scientists and lab assistants are pushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stall the devastating effects of diseases .

I grew up there , too . I would have been born here had it not been that my father was stationed in Massachusetts during the war . I was 18 months old when I arrived in January of 1947 . <p> " The first thing my parents did after purchasing a home was to subscribe to the Daily Report and to begin Shady Grove Dairy delivery . The bottles were glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in colorful , anodized aluminum tumblers , and oleo came in a plastic bag with the dot of color . Owl Lucky Star Market was the first supermarket , followed by King Cole Market , and shopping was a family affair . <p> " Laddies hamburgers , the first fast food hamburger stand , charged 15 cents for a hamburger . Yes , the Hot Dog Show held constant performances in a hot dog-shaped shop with a few stools in front . Taco Lita held court at the corner of San Antonio and Holt ( previously A Street ) , and tacos were five for a dollar . Yes , and Mi Taco had its first store on East Fourth Street across from John Galvin Park . Unfortunately , Ford Lunch had a reputation for racial discrimination , so my parents never took us there to eat . <p> " My mother did n't  believe anyone should be mistreated , especially for race , and when it happened , she never forgot . FYI , another incident occurred back in the early 1950s at a place called Eds Caf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve a black boy whose team had played my brothers team in Pony League baseball game . His team did n't  eat there , and we never went to Eds either . My mother had nothing good to say about Ed or his caf . <p> " The California Theater gave competition to the Granada . On Saturday mornings , our mothers would pile us into the family sedan and haul us downtown where we would pick up tickets to the free kids movies on Saturday mornings . Popcorn was a dime , and big candy bars were 25 cents . We would go to Newberrys and spend our pennies on Evening in Paris cologne in tiny blue vials . I can still smell it and am happy to say that my fragrance choices have improved with age . <p> " A highlight of every summer afternoon was walk to the plunge at Chaffey High School with a quarter tucked inside our bathing caps for the price of admission . That lasted until the polio scare sent us home to inflatable pools in our yards . <p> " The Masonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a walk back in time . The old oak floor creaked , and the sales clerks put the register money in a pneumatic tube and sent it on its screechy way to the mezzanine for each transaction adventurous for a kid in those days . <p> " The Red Car made its daily pilgrimage down Euclid Avenue to drop students at Chaffey High School , and my parents had to repaint the inside of the house every other year to get rid of the soot from the smudge pots . One year they chose a color called Ashes of Roses very appropriate for the time . They looked for property in the citrus groves which were beginning to develop in the mid-1950s . <p> " My days growing up in Ontario were happy and carefree . The worst of my worries were finding the ride to the movies and making sure my kite did not land in a tree . We had a workup softball game going in the cul-de-sac , and our mothers did not worry about us unless we did not come in for lunch or dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Mr. Bowman that the Eaders were neighbors , and my older brother ( Chaffey High class of 1957 ) and I both worked there in high school .

The stereopticon pictures were wonderful , too . I was excited when I got to fourth grade and was allowed to use the adult section upstairs . Actually , I was not in fourth grade , but the childrens section ran out of challenging reading material for me , and I needed a more sophisticated fix . <p> " I am happy to say that today I can polish off a book a day when I have the time but sorry to say that my library card is no longer valid , and I have become a bookstore denizen .

My mother had a lovely rose garden . My childrens great-grandfather Hansen was a good friend of John Armstrong , and when Mr. Armstrong found interesting plants and trees , Grandpa Hansen would plant them in his garden , too . <p> " The last recollection I have is Howells House of a Million Items on Euclid at the corner of either Main Street or Emporia .

They will never know how we came to be who we are unless they understand our past . <p> " P.S. The changes I have seen are phenomenal . Did you know that George Raft used to frequent the house where Matreyek Builders is located on Mountain Avenue ? It was in the middle of citrus groves .
