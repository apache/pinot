If you want to wear shoes or a sweatshirt , please grab a plastic bag after you check-in at the gear bag table ( just outside the Senior Center ) , mark it with your race number and bring it with you on the ferry . You may put your extra items in this bag during the ferry ride to the island and our volunteer crew will make sure these bags get back to the finish area . <p> Will there be restrooms or changing facilities on race day morning ? <p> Port-a-potties will be set up at the end of the promenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the grandstands on your right , continue down the path and you 'll find them ) .

The " Non-Wetsuit " category is for those who wear regular swim suits only . <p> Can my friends and family ride out on the ferry with me ? <p> We charter ferries to accommodate event participants . Unfortunately , the ferries will not have room for your friends and family members . Besides , they might not get back in time to see you finish ! <p> I 'm worried about the swim . <p> The Alcatraz swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you that over the past 27 years , we 've safely escorted more than 15,000 swimmers along this course . The biggest variable is the tides . Luckily , our race director , Dave Horning , has swum the course 75 times and knows the San Francisco Bay tides well . We specifically plan the date of our Alcatraz events around the tides . <p> When the ferry drops you off on the east side of the island , and as you round the south end of the island when you start your swim , Aquatic Park ( your target ) is straight ahead . You will be given instructions race day morning on which buildings to spot off of during the swim . These instructions are based on a test swim conducted the day before during similar tidal conditions . Mind these instructions . <p> If you aim directly for Aquatic Park , the tide will sweep you west past the entrance and a boat will have to pick you up . If you aim too far left , the worst that can happen is that you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) until you reach the entrance . If you aim too far right , you 'll end up west of the entrance , swimming in place against an unbeatable current and trying to get back . <p> Use your common sense and practical judgment and you 'll be fine ! <p> Any other advice on the swim ? <p> Swim gloves and booties are discouraged on this swim unless you have trained using them and are extremely comfortable swimming in them . They can sometimes fill with water and make it more difficult to swim . <p> Neoprene swim hoods are allowed . Please wear the swim cap given to you over your swim hood . Another option is to bring an extra swim cap and wear it under your event swim cap which can help keep your head warmer . <p> Hold on to your goggles as you jump from the ferry as they can sometimes easily pop off as you hit the water . <p> Swim away from the boat immediately after entering the water to make way for the next participants . The faster everyone disembarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line will be marked by a row of kayakers . Swim up to the start line , but please do n't hang on kayaks or crowd around them . You may swim around to warm up behind the start line , but keep in mind , everything starts rather quickly -- 6 to 8 minutes after we start disembarkation . The race starts at the sound of the ferry 's horn . <p> What if I panic during the swim ? <p> If you find when you start to swim that your heart is beating rapidly and your breathing feels out of control , this is perfectly normal . It 's just the adrenaline rush of race day paired with the shock of the cold bay water . Use your own judgment on whether to continue , especially if you have any medical conditions , but most people find that if they continue to swim , they warm up , get their breathing back under control and are able to get back into a groove and finish the swim . You may backstroke , or swim with your head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you feel that you can not complete the swim or you need the assistance of a kayaker , stay put and put one arm straight up in the air . A kayaker will come to you and discuss your options . It is perfectly legal to grab the nose of a kayak and wait out a cramp , get your breathing under control , etc . Do n't hesitate to take the measures you need to finish your swim . <p> A smart athlete will know when it 's not their day . You 'll always be welcome to come back and try again .

The next year , John Robertson , a journalist on CBC-TV , resolved that it would never happen again . He inspired a small group of friends to take on the enormous concept of a new event " the Manitoba Marathon " to support Manitobans who live with an intellectual disability . And right from Day 1 in 1979 , the participants in the Manitoba Marathon have made every mile count , by raising funds to build a better community . <p> John 's idea was a simple one . Get community organizations , volunteers , sponsors and the City of Winnipeg to put on a great event for runners , and in turn , ask every runner to make a personal donation or take their pledge sheet to their neighbours and friends , to support the Manitoba Marathon 's cause . <p> Since 1979 , runners have done exactly that , raising over millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manitobans have been freed from institutional care , and welcomed back into their communities .

@@21648674 @1648674/ <p> l Musella , DPM is a podiatrist in private practice in Hewlett , NY . He worked his way through school as a computer programmer for medical research projects . <p> His interest in brain tumors started when his siter-in-law , Lana , was diagnosed with a gbm in 1992 , and was told it was hopeless . After surgery and radiation , the tumor was larger than before the surgery and she was told she only had a few weeks left to live and there was no treatment options for her other than a standard course of bcnu , which had no chance to help her for more than a few extra weeks . <p> At that time , there was no world wide web ! Version 1 of Netscape was released on December 15 , 1994 . Al was an active member of Compuserve , and Compuserve had a cancer forum , with sections devoted to the top 10 cancers ( and no brain tumor section ) . Al created and ran the Brain Tumor Forum on Compuserve in January 1993 . He organized the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA to find what treatments were available . That list was posted on Compuserve and became the basis for the first internet database of clinical trials ! At that time , the NCI only maintained lists of clinical trials that they funded , not the trials sponsored by the drug companies or the individual doctors or hospitals . ( They do most now ) . And the only way to access them was to call the NCI and they would mail them to you . The NCI invited Al to demonstrate his technology to them , and the clinicaltrials.gov website was partially modelled after virtualtrials.com ! <p> Al found a few clinical trials that would accept Lana , after being told by a few major brain tumor centers that there were none . She did very well for a while , getting to see her 4 kids grow up , then unfortunately died of a recurrence on Oct 25,2000 . She lived over 8 years after being told she only had a few weeks left . Many of those years were in excellent condition , with her taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ironically , Al 's father was diagnosed with a GBM in 1999 , a year after Al formed the Musella Foundation .
