
 of Govt Domestic Violence Leave <p> The Canberra Times reported on Tuesday night that the orders to remove the leave came from the federal workplace authority , which answers directly to Minister for Women Michaelia Cash . <p> Up to 30 public service employers insisted that the right of their workers to take time off for family violence be removed , including the Human Services Department and the Australian Taxation Office . <p> CEO of Domestic Violence NSW Moo Baulch said she was " surprised " by the news , which coincided with International Women 's Day . <p> " Domestic violence leave is important on both a practical level but also a symbolic level , so it sends out a really clear message within workplaces that impacts of domestic violence are recognised and taken very seriously by employers , " Baulch said . <p> " And of course on a practical level , it also gives employees the ability to access that leave in recognition that when you 're going through a crisis ... that that takes time and there there are impacts , particularly trauma , that relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that victims of family violence can still take miscellaneous leave , Baulch said this ignored the symbolic importance of designated leave . <p> " That 's probably why people are upset about the removal of this leave , because it 's a symbolic representation that domestic violence leave is very different from other types of leave , " she said . <p> " It 's not the same as sick leave , it 's not the same as personal leave , it 's actually specifically for a purpose , and sending out a really clear message , not just to victims of violence , but also to perpetrators saying ' this sort of stuff will not be tolerated within our workplace and we take it very seriously . ' " <p> ACT Greens Senate candidate Christina Hobbs also called the decision a " a huge step backwards for the public service and women working in the public sector " . <p> " Those who fear for their safety should n't have to worry about losing their jobs if they need to go to court or access support , " Hobbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis to use their annual leave and many of them wo n't have supporting documentation for other kinds of leave . <p> " The timing of yesterday 's reports was ironic . Malcolm Turnbull and Michaelia Cash talked the talk on International Women 's Day , but behind the scenes they were stripping support to their own public servants . " <p> Hobbs also said that the government should be leading all employers in the implementation of domestic violence leave . <p> " Everybody has a role in supporting people affected by domestic violence . Instead of cutting off help , the government and the public service should be setting an example for employers on how to show support , " she said . <p> Govt 's public service policy needs to change . For people who need it , Domestic Violence Leave is n't an ' enhancement ' https : <p> In January 2015 telco giant , Telstra became the first corporate to offer 10 days domestic violence leave for all of its 34,000 staff . <p> Telstra 's General Manager of Diversity and Industries , Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leave was available to anyone affected by domestic violence , even if they were not the direct victim , and that they could apply for it retrospectively . <p> " Domestic and family violence can take a variety of different forms , not just physical violence , but there can be emotional , financial or other kinds of violence that people experience , " Roderick said . <p> " There 's other leave if you need to take time off for other personal things . The idea here is we treat the subject matter with respect and the people that are experiencing family or domestic violence with the utmost respect , privacy and confidentiality , recognising the sensitivity around the issue .

 for Profits on Board with Collective Impact <p> Social change advocate and Director for Strategic Engagement at Uniting , Doug Taylor , reflects on his experience in collective impact initiatives , on what works for larger Not for Profits . <p> When my partner and I have travelled abroad with our children , we developed a saying to manage their reactions to experiences of cultural shock , " it 's not better or worse just different . " <p> I 'm 12 months into my tenure at Uniting and think that 's probably the best way ( granted although a little too relativistic ) to describe the experience of transitioning from leading a smaller Not for Profit to being part of a larger one . It 's not better or worse just different , with unique challenges and opportunities . <p> In my short time I 've reflected a lot on my previous work on collective impact initiatives and what this might mean for larger NGOs like Uniting . I know that I 'm not alone and that there are others who are asking the same questions and making significant contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as relevant for these few early adopters but instead the next wave of practitioners from larger organisations who will be charged with the challenge of integrating this practice once it is mainstreamed and delivers on the promise of better social outcomes . <p> So here are a few reflections for these colleagues in larger Not for Profits and people who are working with them as part of broader collective impact strategies : <p> To make collective impact happen you do need the " elephants in the room " <p> I was struck by the Centre for Social Impact 's recent analysis of ACNC data on the Not for Profit sector . To recap the headline , 130 charities earn 50.3 per cent of the sectors income ( or further to this , 3.6 per cent of all charities earn 81.8 per cent of revenue ) . This highlights how critical large NFPs are to the delivery of social services in our community . Therefore , to really deliver on collective impact , which is fundamentally about system redesign , you must get those principally responsible for the delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing new but these statistics make the point loud and clear , that if you do n't have the " elephants of service delivery in the room " you are really not going to make the change collective impact promises . <p> The challenge here is not in understanding the criticality of engaging these large NFPs but in actually doing it . It 's not easy , they can be inward focused , self-reliant and perhaps most concerningly , solely consumed by service delivery . To get these larger Not for Profits in the room to do Collective Impact there needs to be a recommitment on their behalf to the basics of Social Change . What do I mean by this and what might happen if this does n't occur ? <p> To go forward you have to go back to the basics of social change <p> For many Not for Profits , and perhaps most larger ones , there needs to be a refocusing on the basics of social change , and without these foundations ' attempts to engage in collective impact will be ad-hoc , episodic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied with service delivery and have no vision for any of the other fundamental elements of social change like Community Development or Societal Advocacy . <p> I 'm sure you 'll find many organisations with nice mission statements that talk about the importance of these elements but dig under the surface and look for what 's invested in this work and the level of rigour applied through Outcomes Frameworks and Theories of Change and you 'll likely be somewhat disappointed . This is why collective impact is so often a disconnect with many larger NFPs , there 's invariably no internal framework or strategy to accommodate such work . <p> In response to this problem I see a number of NFPs committing themselves to collective impact projects , which is fantastic , but my concern is that without doing the hard work of shifting the rest of the core business of service delivering to have a broader vision of its function , such projects will have limited internal impact . It 's akin to what corporate social responsibility has become to many corporations , a bolted on project that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We 've been grappling with this at Uniting and have recommitted ourselves to 's Social Ecological Framework and his emphasis on creating change with individuals , families , communities and at the structural level . This has meant being more intentional about this work and developing some simple frameworks to engage colleagues internally , such as the framework below which we use to describe our work in " enlivening communities " . <p> This foundation will help us make the most of collective impact opportunities and ensures it is seen as front and centre and not something marginal . It keeps the broader community at the forefront of our mind as we deliver services and reminds our people that working at a community level is part of the brief . <p> It also helps us fully leverage our large service delivery footprint to work at a community and societal level . Without some solid social change foundations in place , engaging large NFPs is still possible but it will be unstable and subject to changes to the whim of key personnel and other shifting priorities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect world , these foundations would be in place in all larger NFPs which would ensure active engagement in collective impact strategies . We do n't live in that world so the work ahead is that combination of " flying the plane and building it at the same time " . In other words laying the foundations whilst being " strategically opportunistic " . <p> But what does this mean in practice ? <p> Engaging executives and non-executives in discussion about organisational mission and the core elements of social change . Essentially making the case for a broader vision and not just the delivery of services . <p> Involve people from across your organisation in the development of frameworks that will legitimise the work of collective impact . Do this development work but do n't let " perfect be the enemy of the good " . It must always be a work in progress . <p> For those engaging large NFPs from the outside , it 's critical that you have a twofold engagement strategy . That is , you have to work with the local team in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment of resources in collective impact can be validated and also because you will need senior engagement should there be any changes to practice in the future . In reality you ca n't change a large NFP , or any NFP in fact , from the outside . To create change you will need to find internal partners who you can support so they can lead the charge . <p> Make the most of opportunities to participate in collective impact but do n't let them become a distraction to this larger work outlined above . Instead leverage these opportunities to force internal conversation to learn and develop . <p> Avoid the excuse that many raise to not participate in collective impact , that is " we need to get our colleagues collaborating internally before we work with others " . This excuse is a surefire way to do nothing . Sometimes working with others externally can force internal collaboration . <p> Do some mapping of what your organisation is currently doing with collective impact strategies . You 'll be surprised at the many ways in which you are part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large organisations there are many tentacles into communities and much of the work goes under the radar . <p> So there 's a short reflection on making collective impact work for larger NFPs after one year of working at Uniting . I hope it 's a useful contribution to this important work and helpful for my colleagues that are part of larger NFPs or are charged with trying to engage them . <p> About the author : Doug Taylor is the Director for Strategic Engagement at Uniting and was previously CEO of United Way Australia .

 Blame for Loss of ' Charity ' Costello <p> World Vision 's CEO Tim Costello has painted a grim picture of the state of giving in Australia and the Not for Profit sector in an interview being aired on television at the weekend . <p> In an episode of The Conversation with Alex Malley , Tim Costello said he has never seen a worse period for charity in Australia and blames the failings of Australia 's political leaders for Australians ' waning compassion and giving . <p> " I have seen a shrinking of the Australian soul , and I do attribute it to leadership , " Costello said during the one-on-one interview with host Alex Malley , the CEO of accounting peak body CPA Australia . <p> " I think the leadership has been relentlessly negative and fear prone , unnecessarily polarised . " <p> " This has been the worst time of my life in 12 years at World Vision , " he said . <p> " I 've lain awake at night ... just seeing faces of staff who are passionate , professional , who did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now part of the World Vision alumni . ' " <p> In Pro Bono Australia 's inaugural Podcast in February Tim Costello said that in 2016 the Australian public must emerge from a " bubble of self-pity " . <p> " We have still a rich nation , the third richest on a per-capita basis in the world . The bubble of self-pity has been ' we 're all hurting , we 're all victims ' , and politicians , to get our vote , have said ' we feel your pain , ' " Costello said . <p> Costello said that Australian 's despondency , which was affecting their sense of charity , was self-imposed , and politicians had used this to their advantage . <p> In the pre-recorded television interview with Malley , Costello also reflected on the immense feelings of self-doubt he faced when he was appointed to such a significant leadership role at World Vision . <p> " My wife will tell you , after my first day here at World Vision , I came home , I was so overwhelmed I lay in bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tomorrow , ' " Costello said . <p> " It was absolutely overwhelming and it took me some time to really find my feet . " <p> Costello spoke on his relationship with his brother , former Federal Treasurer Peter Costello , and admitted they had experienced some testing times when he was in the Howard government . <p> " I could call it as I saw it , and sometimes it was against the Howard government and some things Peter was doing . There 's no question those moments involved friction , " he said . <p> Another testing period for Costello was during his time as Mayor of St Kilda Council . He clashed with then premier of Victoria , Jeff Kennett , on a number of public initiatives , including the opening of Crown Casino in 1994 . <p> Gambling and the detrimental impact it can have on people and families is an issue Costello remains outspoken on . <h> NSW justice group 
 UN Sustainability Development Goals <p> By Peter Devereux , <p> Volunteering under the banner of the new universal sustainable development goals provides an opportunity to bridge the different worlds of national and international volunteering , writes Dr Peter Devereux from Curtin University . <p> When people in Australia think of volunteering they may think of volunteering in their kid 's school tuck shop or helping with a local beach or river cleanup , supporting kids with disabilities . Increasingly people also think of the growing volumes of voluntourists volunteering as part of overseas holidays doing some tree planting , working with disadvantaged youth or caring for turtles . <p> Both these conceptions of volunteering are most often based on the idea of service or helping which is important and definitely the dominant way of thinking about volunteering in countries like Australia , the US and England but not the only way of thinking about volunteer activity . <p> The United Nations has recognised since 2001 at least four different types of volunteer activity : mutual aid or self-help , service to others , participation or civic engagement , and advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 and 2015 State of the World 's Volunteerism reports and is particularly pertinent for the end of what might be termed an old binary view of the world of " developed " and " developing " countries . <p> The new world view is evident in the rise of new economic powers like Indonesia and " the BRICS " ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) and the issues of inequality and poverty in some " developed countries " after the 2008 economic crisis . This changing world highlights the opportunity for tackling together common challenges and opportunities . The shift from a global focus on MDGs in developing countries to universal SDGs in all countries reflects this new context with its challenges and opportunities . <p> As part of deliberations for a Post 2015 agenda beyond the Millennium Development Goals theUN Secretary-General 's Synthesis Report , highlighted volunteering as a " powerful and cross-cutting means of implementation " of the SDGs , able to " help localise the new agenda by providing new spaces of interaction between governments and people for concrete and scalable actions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the High-level Political Forum ( HLPF ) , the UN body that follows up and reviews the implementation of sustainable development commitments this gives volunteer groups the authority to contribute in an official capacity to shape the implementation of the new sustainable development goals . <p> As a result the sustainable development goals provide significant opportunities for volunteer groups to demonstrate the difference volunteers make and use this to strengthen an enabling environment for volunteers and volunteer involving organisations . This is both for volunteer themselves as well as their communities tackling climate change and inequality , enhancing health and wellbeing , and building stronger partnerships between people and institutions at global national and local levels . <p> Groups like UN Volunteers , the International Association for Volunteer Effort and the International Forum for Volunteering in Development are leading the charge at international levels but more work is required to make the national and international connections and bring the two worlds together . <p> What the SDGs open up is an opportunity to connect the work of Australian groups facilitating international volunteering like AVI and Scope Global in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia which promote and advocate for national , state and local volunteering . <p> SDG 10 for example focuses on reducing inequality within and between countries which provides an opportunity to combine the complementary experience and expertise of national and international volunteer involving organisations . A successful example of such partnerships between AVI , Volunteering SA &amp; NT , and the Aboriginal community of Oodnadatta enabled the successful roll out of a pilot community-based , Aboriginal youth-led Volunteer Program in Oodnadatta . <p> The Aboriginal volunteer program recorded many positive achievements including improvements in school children 's literacy and cultural competency as well as the confidence and skills of the volunteers and strong community ownership through a whole of community approach . As the2015 report stated : " The Aboriginal Volunteer Program 's approach is on the cutting edge of the world 's new Sustainable Development Goals to reduce inequality in all forms , everywhere by " acting in collaborative partnership " and utilising " volunteering as a cross-cutting means of implementation . " <p> The upcoming Volunteering Australia conference in April provides a forum to discuss how Australia can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , our region and the world . The SDGs can give significant policy level leverage for Australian volunteer groups and Australian volunteers in the breadth of their work to create " new spaces of interaction between governments and people for concrete and scalable actions " . <p> About the author : Peter Devereux is a part time Research Fellow at Curtin University 's Sustainability Policy Institute advancing the Doctorate of Sustainable Development focussed on the new UN Sustainable Development Goals .

 Christian Lobby Stripped of Charitable Status <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The Sex Party has called on the federal ministers responsible for the regulation of charities to urgently review the status of the Australian Christian Lobby ( ACL ) over its role in campaigning against the Safe Schools Program and same sex marriage . <p> The Sex Party said the ACL is a registered charity based solely on its stated aim to " advance the cause of religion " the only qualifier for many organisations to be granted a host of tax exemptions . <p> The ACL is registered on the charity regulator website as a Not for Profit entity and is exempt from income tax . <p> The organisation describes its principal activities as " lobbying , advocacy , research , media , events and communications to promote Christian values and engage the Christian constituency in the public arena " . <p> Sex Party leader and Victorian Upper House member , Fiona Patten , said the ACL was widely acknowledged as being behind the aggressive lobbying against the Safe Schools Program as well as a major sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I speak to are absolutely appalled when they learn that the likes of the Australian Christian Lobby are basically subsidised by the Australian taxpayer " , she said . " How are these activities in any way said to be advancing the cause of religion especially when marriage equality is a major election issue ? " <p> The million Safe Schools education program was launched by the Abbott Government and operates in hundreds of schools across Australia . Supporters say it 's designed to curb bullying and establish a safer school culture by teaching high school students about gay , lesbian and transgender issues . <p> Opponents including a number of Liberal Party back benchers say it 's a propaganda program forced on young secondary students and raises sexual issues inappropriate for their age . <p> Patten said that her party would run candidates in the federal seats of Higgins in Victoria which is currently held by Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer , and Pearce in WA which is held by Social Services Minister , Christian Porter . She said together the two ministers administer the charity sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyle Shelton told Pro Bono Australia News that he was not surprised by the Sex Party 's attack on his group . <p> " The Sex Party is an apologist for the harmful pornography industry ... and they have a seat in the Victorian Parliament . " <p> He said the ACL advocates for Christian values in both politics and in public debate for the common good . <p> " The ACL under its registration with the ACNC ( Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ) must provide audited financial statements . Our reporting requirements are rigorous and public , " he said . <p> A joint statement last week by Ministers O'Dwyer and Porter announced the retention of the charity regulator , Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) . <p> The Sex Party said it argued vehemently against the abolition of the ACNC on the grounds that it was an attempt " by the religious rump of the Coalition government , via the previous Minister for Social Services , the arch conservative Kevin Andrews , to shield the likes of the immensely wealthy Catholic Church from public scrutiny @ @ <h> Video settings <h> 
 A New Start for Unemployed NFP <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The Welfare Rights Centre NSW says the Labor Party 's new social policy framework is a positive blueprint that could help to reduce inequality and poverty in Australia . <p> The Labor opposition recently released its policy agenda called Growing Together which examines some of the key economic and social challenges facing Australia and outlines a policy to tackle inequality by delivering full employment . <p> " A commitment to full employment and individualised , wraparound services to address the barriers to work experienced by disadvantaged people is an essential step in the journey into employment , " Policy and Media Officer at the Welfare Rights Centre NSW , Gerard Thomas , said . <p> " Access to legal services , fair and efficient tax reform , housing affordability and ensuring access to high quality Centrelink services are additional ingredients to add to this comprehensive report . <p> " An independent , expert review into the adequacy of the Newstart Allowance is welcome . The single adult Newstart Allowance currently stands of 39.8 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford soaring rents , and to meet food costs and utility bills . The poverty of Newstart is grinding and it robs people of their dignity . <p> " Lifting the Newstart Allowance will provide a new start while people are preparing for a looking for work . <p> " An increase in the Newstart Allowance will help to redress a serious policy mistake which is responsible for pushing thousands of single parent families deeper into poverty . " <p> Thomas said single parents on Newstart with no other income were currently a week worse off than their peers on the Parenting Payment Single as a result of successive government cuts to social security payments for lone parents . <p> " These cuts have left single parents worse-off by about a year . The 46 per cent of single working parents earning employment income are even worse off as a result of the harsher means testing arrangements that apply to the Newstart Allowance , " he said . <p> Thomas said Welfare Rights was interested to hear how the major parties plan to improve access to Centrelink services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes to process Centrelink appeals when they disagree with the decision . <p> " Last year there were about 125,000 Centrelink appeals across all levels , and in the past two years complaints about Centrelink increased by 35 per cent , " he said . <p> The Labor inequality policy agenda also received support from welfare peak body ACOSS , Anglicare and Early Childhood Australia .@@7809867 <h> Standing alongside youth 
 Care <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> CEO of CARE Australia Dr Julia Newton-Howes AM was inspired by her childhood experiences to pursue a career in international aid . Dr Newton-Howes is this week 's Changemaker . She spoke to journalist Ellie Cooper . <p> Growing up in Rhodesia under a white minority government , Dr Newton-Howes saw first-hand the devastating impact of inequality and poverty . <p> After a varied career working first as a scientific researcher and then in the Australian Government aid agency , she had the opportunity to join the Not for Profit sector as the CEO of CARE Australia in 2007 . <p> As this week 's Changemaker , she shares her knowledge about the multifaceted nature of poverty and what inspires her to tackle one of the world 's most pervasive issues . <p> You had a very interesting childhood , can you tell me about it ? <p> I was born in a really remote part of India , but I left there before my first birthday . My parents had been living in Africa and went back from India to Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimbabwe , and left there to go to university at 19 . <p> That was a huge influence on my life , because at that time Zimbabwe was Rhodesia . It had a white minority government that had racist legislation and I guess on so many occasions I saw poverty really close up , and I think the enduring lesson from my childhood was so much of your life is not defined by how good you are or how clever you are , it 's defined by where you were born and who your parents were . And because I saw , every day , people who were just as clever as me , or cleverer , more able , but who had a very different life . And I think the world would be so much more prosperous if everyone had a fair go and , really , we do n't . <p> I was very , very fortunate to end up migrating to Australia . I studied in the UK and while I was there I lost my Zimbabwean citizenship because the government of Robert Mugabe basically took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the world and thought Australia would be a great place to go and live , and I got a job in Australia and managed to become a permanent citizen here , and then resident . So I 've lived here since I came in 1984 . In some ways getting Australian citizenship is better than winning the lottery . How lucky am I to live in a country that gives its people by and large , not entirely so many opportunities . <p> So it was this experience that made you want to work in international aid ? <p> Absolutely . One of the most confronting memories I have is as a very young child at home with my mother and a woman knocking on the door asking for food . And I can just remember , as a child , struggling to understand . In my world my parents were in charge , my parents provided food and shelter and kept me safe , and the woman who knocked on the door had a baby on her back , and she had no food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so authoritative , who appear to be in control how could this woman not even be able to feed herself . That is a memory that really has stayed with me . I have always felt really strongly about the issue of poverty and hunger , and also the intersection of gender with that . My life experience , but also all the data and facts you look at about poverty , anywhere , show that you 're more likely to be poor if you 're female . And that is because the most invasive type of discrimination in the world is on the basis of gender . <p> But actually at school I was good at science . I studied science at university , did a PhD in science , and worked as a researcher for a number of years . And it was after I had my first child and was expecting my second that I had this opportunity for a complete career change . I moved into what was then , the government department that manages Australia 's aid program , and worked there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank , had postings overseas , both in Washington DC and in Vietnam , and I suppose got more and more drawn into international development work , and always felt really passionate about it . <p> Why did you join CARE Australia ? <p> One of the reasons I wanted to join CARE , after really enjoying a career in AusAid , was that I recognised the Australian Government 's aid program primarily works government to government , through working with the governments around the world , to provide assistance . And that 's important , but it 's not enough . Actually , many governments are unwilling or incapable of providing what these citizens need , and I became frustrated by the limits to what one can achieve at that level , and I was interested in what NGOs , civil society organisations , offer and how they work , and so when the opportunity to move to CARE came up I grabbed it , and I 'm really pleased I did . <p> The other thing about CARE is we really strive to understand what works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple formula , often for people who are trapped in poverty there are multiple factors around their circumstances it might be environmental degradation , it might be discrimination , it might be dysfunctional government . To really be able to hear their concerns , to understand their needs and to be able to work at a grassroots community level to address those needs , is incredibly motivating and rewarding . <p> I think in the late 90s and early 2000s there was a lot of work done globally to get a better understanding of poverty . We often measure poverty just in terms of someone 's income , but actually poverty is multifaceted . When you listen to poor people they will often say their concerns are the stigma that 's attached to poverty , the fact that people are rude to them , their teachers at school are rude to their children , that they have no access to power-holders , when they go to the clinic they can be treated in a very rude and dismissive way . It 's about how do we address the stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as look at income measures and access to services . I think that 's where civil society organisations really have a lot of knowledge and understanding of working to support change at a grassroots level . <p> What 's the most challenging aspect of your role ? <p> The biggest challenge is always securing funding , and we 're always on a knife edge on that . Fundraising is hard , and we 've got a lot of evidence of the effectiveness of our work , but people do n't have a lot of time to capture their imagination if you 're persuading them to provide funding , What 's a 30-second grab that will really excite people ? It 's fabulous how many generous Australians support our work , or the work of other Not for Profits . We apply for funding from the Australian Aid Program and while we have a very good success rate , I always feel you 're climbing a mountain and you 'll never reach the summit in terms of fundraising . That 's the biggest challenge . <p> I guess the other thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And most of our staff are nationals of the countries where we work . We have a small number of expatriate staff , but all in all CARE Australia has about 1,000 staff and most of those are nationals of Papua New Guinea or Vanuatu or Timor Leste . Getting the right staff in the right place at the right time is also a challenge . But they 're also challenges that I relish . <p> What do you enjoy most about your job ? <p> It 's always going into the field and meeting the communities where we work , and listening to them , listening to how their lives have changed . About three weeks ago I was in Papua New Guinea , and I visited a community outside Goroka where we work with the coffee industry and coffee growers . One of the things we 've seen is that whilst women do most of the work , when it comes time to sell the coffee beans that sale is handled by the men , and the men decide what happens to the money . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethinking about family business units . We 've been working with the coffee growers to provide quite simple training about how to set financial goals , how to think about the expenses your family has , and encouraging families to meet as a family group to talk about where their money goes . What we 're seeing is that this is encouraging men and women to talk about who does the work and who decides what the money is spent on . It was quite interesting meeting this group and hearing their views on how eye-opening this training has been for them . That 's really exciting , that 's the sort of program that is always such a pleasure to go and see . <p> You 're a member of the General Division of the Order of Australia , and you 've been recognised as Telstra ACT Business Woman of the Year and one of the Westpac 100 Women of Influence what do you put your personal success down to ? <p> One , I have to say luck . How lucky was I to get to Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of support . I have a fabulous team of staff here , and a really fabulous board . And I always think one of the most important decisions you ever make is who you hire to work with you . Always try to hire people who are much cleverer than you .

 Talking ' Philanthropy ' Study <p> Financial advisers are n't talking about philanthropy with their wealthy clients as much as they used to , according to longitudinal research from the Queensland University of Technology . <p> Professional advisers in finance , wealth management , law , accounting , taxation and estate management have been questioned since 2002 on their views and experiences around client and personal philanthropy by researchers from QUT 's Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies ( ACPNS ) . <p> Overall , the results of the 2015/16 study suggested a slight shift away from advising affluent clients on philanthropic matters . <p> The research also highlighted some perceived lack of organisational and professional association support and the feeling of many advisers that they do not have the expertise to advise in this area . <p> The researchers , Marie Crittall , Dr Wendy Scaife and Stephanie , said the results provided thought fodder for advisers , their organisations and sector bodies . <p> They said there is evidence of more discussion in Australia on expanding the ways people can give , spurred by initiatives such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and better giving . <p> " There is also active work afoot by Philanthropy Australia to instigate a course to assist advisers interested in better identifying and serving philanthropically inclined clients . Thus this fourth survey in our series is set against a changing philanthropy backdrop . However , the overriding sense is little has changed since the preceding survey in 2008 , " they said . <p> Some of the findings include : <p> Similar to previous years , most advisers reported discussing philanthropy with less than 10 per cent of their high-net-worth ( HNW ) clients . <p> A slight gender difference emerged with female advisers seemingly more open and interested than male advisers to approach this subject . <p> A little more than one-quarter of advisers have personally developed a philanthropic strategy for at least one HNW client , while nearly one-third of all advisers surveyed do not expect the topic to arise . <p> When philanthropy is discussed , advisers tend to mention the topic first . <p> Some measures are slightly down from the last survey in 2008 : <p> Slightly fewer advisers see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personally can afford to be philanthropic . <p> The desire to discuss philanthropy with affluent clients is slightly dampened and slightly more concern is evident about such a conversation affecting the client relationship . <p> One in five advisers report discussing philanthropy from the beginning of the relationship with the client . <p> A slight increase is evident in advisers not feeling well informed about their clients ' philanthropic activities and interests , with around half of advisers reporting this . <p> Only a small percentage ( 4 per cent of female advisers and 5 per cent of male advisers ) feel well informed about providing philanthropic assistance . <p> The research said the results were mixed when it came to the support from the advisers ' organisations and professional associations . Most advisers felt that they do not have support from their professional association to discuss philanthropy . Conversely , only 39 per cent reported not receiving assistance in the form of resources , information and other support from the professional association . <p> Around 60 per cent of all advisers indicated that it was difficult to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advisers indicated that discussing philanthropy is accepted in their organisation but this has decreased from more than 40 per cent in 2008 . Furthermore , around 30 per cent of advisers reported no real support for advisers wanting to discuss philanthropy ( compared to 22 per cent in 2008 ) . <p> As with previous years , the research found that the major constraint identified in providing philanthropic advice was around being unsure how best to advise in this area . Information packs or guides were highlighted as the most useful type of resource and most advisers wanted these to focus on options for philanthropic structures . <p> Roarers , we 
 Power Critical to Homeless Website <p> Ask Izzy , the mobile website that connects people who are homeless or at risk with services has had a strong first month , but the organisation behind it says there is more hard work to be done . <p> Around 31,000 people have visited Ask Izzy since it launched in January to search for homelessness and other support services across the country . <p> CEO David Spriggs said that while this is a great start , it is only just the beginning of getting Ask Izzy into the hands of people in need . <p> " We are very pleased with the initial numbers to the website , but what we need is sustained uptake over time and to get that we need help from service providers , " Spriggs said . <p> " Service providers play a critical role in making sure Ask Izzy is a relevant tool for them and the people they support . <p> " I encourage them to visit the site , provide feedback and help us get the word out by telling their clients . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Izzy , including over 100 people who were directly involved in the co-design . This group included people with lived experience of homelessness , caseworkers , Not for Profit and government departments . <p> With a study by the University of Sydney finding that almost 80 per cent of people who are homeless own smartphones , Ask Izzy was designed for mobile , tablet and desktop . <p> " Our first question was : ' what do people who are homeless really need ? ' So we got in touch with organisations including the Council to Homeless Persons and , who introduced us to a group of passionate and engaged people with lived experience of homelessness , " Spriggs said . <p> " Their insights allowed us to consider things that we had n't thought about before . " <p> Danny Nepean , who spent over a decade living on the streets of Melbourne , said that Ask Izzy would have been a vastly valuable tool when he was homeless . <p> " The knowledge that I picked up playing around with Izzy for about an hour probably took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up , " Nepean said . <p> Spriggs said that continuing feedback from users is important . <p> " Ask Izzy is a product of collaboration with the sector and that collaboration needs to continue to make sure Ask Izzy is a relevant tool that assists service delivery in the long term , " he said . <p> " We ca n't do that without listening to our users and responding to feedback . " <p> Spriggs said that another way service providers can play their part is by checking their service listing is up-to-date . <p> " No one expects to be homeless , and it can be a really complex system to navigate . We need to make sure service listings are up-to-date so that people in need get the right information , " he said . <p> " We have a team dedicated to updating the directory , but we encourage service providers to get in touch if they have a change in program or find their information is not up-to-date . " <p> Ask Izzy will evolve over time , with the next product update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary services and events capability , which will allow service providers to add their own information directly into the database . <p> " We 're confident that with continuing collaboration , Ask Izzy can become the go-to tool for finding services and can make a real difference in the lives of those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness , " Spriggs said . <p> " Over time , we hope Ask Izzy will give a comprehensive view of service demand across the country , allowing the sector and government to make more informed choices about future investment .

 Headway 's proposal to the Queensland Government on how , by utilising Social Impact Bonds , it can significantly reduce the implementation and management costs associated with the introduction of our National Injury Insurance Scheme ( NIIS ) . <p> As well I argue that it will provide Public Benevolent Institutions with empowerment to manage and operate the scheme , under the auspices of the Motor Accident Insurance Commission . <p> Social Impact Bonds LifeCare framework would provide the impetus for innovation and achieve greater effectiveness due to the pressure to attain specific results . <p> Social Impact Bonds will : <p> shift the focus on to outcomes rather than outputs <p> direct resources towards early intervention <p> encourage innovation <p> improve the evidence base <p> ensure accountability and transparency <p> massively reduce the cost of its introduction to motorists <p> improve the lives of many disabled people . <p> In this time of budgetary constraint , Headway ( a Not for Profit offering support to people with an Acquired Brain Injury ) sees this as a way of attracting private investment into an area that has been traditionally a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case for SIB investment this is it ! <p> Community based rehabilitation and management can ultimately replace government responsibility , in large tracts of social expenditure and help to achieve " smaller government " .

Whether large or small , specific or generalist , reactive or proactive , many investing insurers are considering how to prove and improve their impact practice , and support others to do so too . <p> Investing Insurers will want to know about impact for a number of reasons : <p> To understand the difference they make , directly and indirectly . <p> Insurers can make a difference directly by themselves , or indirectly through the work of the charities and social enterprises they support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to understand the difference they seek to make . From there a funder can consider what difference ( intended and unintended ) has been achieved through its funding . <p> To learn from what they , and those they fund , do . <p> Impact assessments inform organisational learning , which can lead to improvements in decision making and performance . This can be applied at individual Public Benevolent Institution level , within and across programs , and within insurance organisations . <p> To ensure they make the most of their resources . <p> Funders know that with every grant or social bond awarded , or dollar spent on other support , there is an opportunity cost of not allocating that resource elsewhere . Recognising and accounting for impact can help investing insurers to improve resource allocation and value for money . It can also help investing insurers to identify and report on their contribution to public benefit . <p> Through providing a social bond investment and support , funders enable individuals , charities and PBI 's to make a difference .

 ' Game Changer ' <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> A national corporate community rapid rehousing partnership for women and children fleeing family violence has exceeded expectations , according to an assessment to mark the initiative 's first anniversary . <p> The partnership has assisted over 560 people across 204 households , including 357 children well above its initial expectations of assisting 250 people in its first year . <p> The partnership , between one of Melbourne 's largest housing and homelessness agencies Launch Housing and REA Group ( the parent company of realestate.com.au ) , is championing how the Not for Profit and corporate sectors can collaborate on finding solutions to homelessness . <p> Australia 's housing affordability crisis is one of the key barriers to women and children leaving violent homes , according to Launch Housing Deputy CEO and Director of Services , Dr Heather Holst . <p> " When REA Group approached us we knew that this kind of partnership could be a game changer . In just 12 months we have worked with partner agencies nationally to help hundreds of women and children who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation . Even worse they might have continued to endure damaging and in some cases life threatening abuse and violence at home , " Dr Holst said . <p> " More than 30 per cent of the people we assist every year at our frontline services are women and children who are unable to remain in the family home because of abuse and violence . " <p> Dr Holst said the partnership with REA Group and Launch Housing , acting as the lead agency , provided a great model of how the Not for Profit and corporate sectors can work together to make a huge difference in local communities . <p> " I think the funding we received from REA Group around over three years is a significant philanthropic investment by a major corporation in Australia . We have partners in Melbourne , Adelaide , Brisbane , Perth and the ACT who receive funding to assist women and children fleeing family violence , " she said . <p> " This brokerage funding can be used for the most pressing need a family group has . It typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt relief , for families who have fallen into arrears , and purchase of furniture and whitegoods . <p> " Because we have been able to put something in place quickly and demonstrate how it works and that information actually fed into the Victorian Family Violence Royal Commission , we were able to give evidence around this fund and we are hoping that this may influence what they think is part of the solution to the family violence problem that they are considering now . <p> " It 's perhaps more of a game changer than usual because of that timing . <p> " But really , it is that we quickly agreed on the solution and with a partner , just got it going on the ground . The partnership has allowed us to get it into the other states . <p> " It is a whole lot quicker than the way you normally have to wait until funding is available and using funding that is available and apply for it . It 's all quite slow and while that is understandable with government probity considerations something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either prove itself or not . " <p> " Our partnership with Launch Housing is not a cause related marketing initiative , it 's an authentic partnership that feeds directly into our purpose of empowering people to make property simple , efficient and stress-free , " REA 's Community Partnerships and Engagement Manager , Jessica Christie said . <p> " If we are not able to achieve the company 's purpose , if we 're not supporting our most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community for example people at risk of homelessness there 's nothing simple , efficient or stress-free about property , " Christie said . <p> " That 's how we landed on the area of homelessness and then it was through a series of focus groups with experts on the area , that representatives from each part of our business narrowed it down to women and children at risk of homelessness as a result of family violence . " <p> Christie said having a partnership which is central to your company 's purpose is a great place to start . <p> " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social issue or cause we wanted to focus our efforts on and while we have a very talented and passionate bunch of people working at REA , we also recognised that we 're certainly not experts on the issue of homelessness or family violence . That 's why we partnered with Launch Housing , as they know a huge amount about this area and the best way of addressing it , " she said . <p> " We do n't tell Launch Housing what to do with that fund , other than specifying the group we 're trying to help from experiencing homelessness . They share updates with us around the number of people supported , the areas the funding goes towards and the impact of it but beyond that , it 's theirs to administer . " <h> See the world 
 Playing Field for Co-ops <p> The peak body for co-operatives and mutuals has welcomed the Senate inquiry report , which recommended that the sector receive more support and recognition from the Australian Government . <p> The Senate handed down a series of recommendations to address the barriers to innovation , growth and free competition for Australia 's member-owned business sector . <p> It also said that the sector should be given greater representation at government policy discussions and be actively promoted as an option for service delivery , particularly community-based initiatives . <p> CEO of the Business Council for Co-operatives and Mutuals , Melina Morrison , said that the report was an " important first step for recognising the way that co-operatives and mutuals increase competition and diversity in markets and contribute to a stable and resilient economy " . <p> " The report 's recommendations will help take the shackles off the sector and allow it to step up and fulfill its potential in both the economy and Australian communities . <p> " Co-operatives and mutuals have grown through the recent economic downturn , with one hand tied behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporations Act be amended to explicitly define mutual enterprise . <p> This would allow greater flexibility in the way that the enterprises raise capital and secure investment opportunities , which Morrison said was " particularly significant " . <p> " Giving mutuals a way to raise equity without demutualising is an opportunity to achieve parity for the sector with other types of businesses and potentially unlock billions of dollars of investment . " <p> The report also called for the eligibility criteria for government grants and funding be amended to ensure that mutuals and co-ops are not excluded on the basis of their business structure . <p> On regulatory issues , the Senate report recommended the harmonisation of disparate state regulations governing co-operatives across the country , which the BCCM has been advocating for since its inception . <p> The report also said that the Australian Government should work with the states and territories to " encourage the establishment of new co-operative and mutual enterprises " . <p> Chairman of BCCM and CEO of CBH Group , Andrew Crane , said the report recognised the contribution of co-operatives and mutuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their members . <p> " Co-operatives are good for both people and the economy and this report provides the necessary reforms to enable the sector to grow and compete in increasingly globalised markets , " Crane said . <p> " The bipartisan support for the report is welcomed by the co-op and mutuals sector , and the BCCM will engage with all political parties for the implementation of the recommendations in full .

 Model for Medical Research <p> Australian Not for Profit has launched a venture philanthropy fund , utilising what it has called a new model of impact investing , to support globally significant medical research projects . <p> The establishment of the fund followed a new tax ruling enabling public and private ancillary funds ( and PAFs ) to lend money for impact investment without the risk of loss if the project is unsuccessful . <p> CEO Roz said it differs from traditional impact investing funds , which are based on their likelihood to succeed . <p> " Medical research is more than likely going to fail , and so no one had really thought about that impacting investing in the past , " said . <p> " In impact investing you like to think there could be a success ... but in our case , the risk is so high that we absolutely can not begin to predict what the outcome would be , it 's in the hands of the science . <p> " So for us , it 's always been about what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does succeed . " <p> She said that while the new tax ruling did n't change existing laws , it provided clarity for stakeholders about the security of its corpus . <p> said , through the fund , PuAFs and PAFs can turn their loan into a tax-deductible donation if medical research outcomes are unsuccessful . <p> " They 're allowed to claim not just the principal but all of the lost interest , " she said . <p> " It 's like getting a free-kick donation , as it 's actually something they 've earned during the time period . <p> " And the interest rate the office ATO has permitted is up to 14 per cent plus the Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate , which at the moment is 2 per cent , so it would be up to 16 per cent interest . <p> " So after a three year project they 've actually increased the value of their principal by 48 per cent .

" <p> also said she hoped the initiative would attract new sources of funding . <p> " We 're hoping to attract lenders or donors who either have n't given to medical research in the past or who are interested in the Israeli connection , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're partnering up with Israeli scientists . <p> " We 're hoping those two factors will attract new funding to medical research , which is very underfunded and really needs the boost .

 Worth ? 1.5B <p> Independent financial institution , Big Society Capital , has produced the first estimate of the size and composition of social investment in the UK , putting its value at ? 1.5 billion ( A$2.8 billion ) . <p> The Big Society Capital report showed that there were nearly 3,500 different social investments outstanding at the end of 2015 , and it estimated that at least 3,000 different charities and social enterprises currently benefit from social investment . <p> The report found that more than two-thirds ( 70 per cent ) of social investment is channelled to charities and social enterprises with some kind of asset lock . The rest of social investment ( 30 per cent ) is focused on social enterprises and profit-with-purpose companies without an asset lock . <p> The report defined social investment as : " The use of repayable finance to achieve a social as well as a financial return .

We are seeing a diverse range of different investment products , with quite significant growth in higher-risk forms of capital such as unsecured loans , community shares and charity bonds .

A lot of the growth in deal-flow has come via higher risk products , " Robinson said . <p> " This research also shows that social investment deal-flow is growing , and is more than double the level of five years ago .

 Shared Value <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> When Rhod Ellis-Jones read the first article about shared value in the Harvard Business Review he was inspired to spearhead the movement in Australia . In this month 's Executive Insight , he explains how shared value has evolved over the last four years . <p> Rhod Ellis-Jones , founder and Deputy Chair of the Shared Value Project and principal at consulting firm Ellis Jones , has been fostering partnerships between the corporate and Not for Profit sectors since the early 2000s . <p> " I was managing what was referred to at the time as blueprint partnerships between corporations and Not for Profit organisations , " Ellis-Jones said . <p> " But what I saw time and time again in those relationships was that ... a lack of alignment in purpose meant that they were unsuccessful a lot of the time , if not all of the time . <p> " Within that , having worked in communications for a number of years , I saw CSR become a public relations tool of the business rather than a focus for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that , it 's just predominantly that was the case . " <p> When Kramer and Porter wrote about the concept of shared value in the Harvard Business Review in 2011 , Ellis-Jones felt that it was the answer to his corporate engagement concerns . <p> " I read the article and went : ' Bang , this is actually the way we should be framing corporate engagement of social sector issues , this is how we can get the capital flow from the corporate sector to social problems , ' " he said . <p> " And the reason it 's continued to be so important is because government has been steadily , for 30 years , retreating from responsibility for social welfare , and essentially outsourcing that to Not for Profits , arms-length public institutions and sometimes companies . <p> " But certainly the toughest basket generally gets addressed by Not for Profit organisations that are required to , as I used to term it , walk up to Spring Street in Victoria every year and sing for their supper ; clearly not sustainable , completely inefficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intractable social issues that we have had for so many decades . " <p> After reading the article he called a meeting at Ellis Jones and said : " ' This bridges our client base , it 's one of the frustrations we 've all voiced , and it frames what we do in our work , let 's invest in it . ' And off we went . " <p> He also wanted to establish a network for the movement in Australia , and created the Shared Value Project with the initial purpose of hosting forums to flesh out whether the notion had merit . <p> " At the same time I flew over for a meeting with Marc Pfitzer , managing director of FSG Group in Europe and colleague of Porter and Kramer , based in Geneva , and had this quite robust discussion about their intentions and our intentions , " he said . <p> He said they recognised they were serious about the issue . " We had their confidence in Australia to be able to start building a network and to connect with those other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " <p> But Ellis-Jones said there were significant challenges to spearheading a new concept , especially in the face of the negative perceptions of CSR . <p> " We were one of the first voices in what would be called a movement now , so there were a lot of people who saw it as a rehashing of what had been , saw it as another corporate attempt to make money under the guise of doing good , as a negative thing , " he said . <p> " There were significant investments in money and time at the agency level before we actually got any work in that space , so it took a tremendous amount of resilience and persistence amongst the team here , but it paid off in the end . <p> " It 's a growing practice , but the important thing is it 's reoriented the business itself . " <p> He said that , despite the hurdles , he was determined to implement shared value in his business . <p> " We could n't not do it . Essentially it reflects exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared value business , so regardless of whether the word was going to stick , we are a shared value business , it 's how we 'd been for many years , " he said . <p> " That in itself meant we just stick to our guns and just be that business , and I think it 's just blind persistence . " <p> As for the Shared Value Project , he said it " stumbled , ran , stumbled , ran " before growing into what it is today . <p> " It became an incorporated Not for Profit organisation a year and a half ago , which was a reflection of a significant interest of corporate Australia , and also some key players in the Not for Profit sector , and therefore , in itself , that validator of shared value as a philosophy and a growing practice that is sustainable , " he said . <p> " That 's one thing that happened that I think 's important . You ca n't do it unless you get the big corporate players involved and you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> The advancement of the Shared Value Project allowed him to focus his efforts on growing shared value initiatives at Ellis-Jones . <p> His team were on board and collectively said : ' You beauty , now we can focus more on the doing , rather than the explaining . " <p> " In four years , from 2011 to 2015 , shared value has very clearly defined our business and what we stand for and who we are , and it 's also meant that even our traditional work is geared towards work that has a measurable social impact . <p> " It 's opened up new areas that did n't exist before , where we have a dialogue at a senior leadership level in business about these sorts of concepts and opportunities , which you just could n't have before . <p> Ellis-Jones works with corporations and Not for Profits to develop social impact strategy , identifying opportunities that will drive business growth while establishing social purpose . <p> Over the last 12 months the agency has been concentrating on change campaigns , using brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're a consulting business , so we work with other business and that 's the beauty of it . Without us they could n't have the results they have , and without them we could n't get the results we need , " Ellis-Jones said . <p> " The more recent one , , was a social change campaign for a company called Probiotec and a collaboration that they have with the CSIRO called . " <p> The campaign , aimed at weight loss , resulted in a spike in the number of people visiting pharmacies for health checks . <p> " The aggregate weight loss from that program is a number of kilos higher than any other weight loss program in Australia . The program focuses people on their health as a weight related issue , not body image or food , " Ellis-Jones said . <p> " It relies on the fact that you 're i 'll if you get over a certain weight , and in doing so , it 's playing a very important role in changing Australian 's perceptions in what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloke leaning against his ute with a bit of a beer belly and going , ' there 's nothing wrong with me mate ' , he 's borderline type 2 diabetes . <p> " That 's what we need to address in Australia . This program does that because you have to have health checks in pharmacies before you can get on the program , right there and then they 'll tell you how at risk you are . " <p> Ellis Jones said the positive benefits of shared value were greater than profit and social change , and the movement has created a positive company culture and attracted loyal staff . <p> " The work is very rewarding , it feeds in on itself , so we have very smart , very motivated people with diverse backgrounds who were attracted to the agency because of its purpose but also the ability to do the work they 've trained to do and have a social impact , " he said . <p> " We 're able to attract people who are very culturally aligned , so the team 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's made it clear to potential customers " who we are and what we do " . <p> " We get a lot of interest in our work , but generally from people who want to work with us , want to work with this agency , rather than others . <p> " So it 's been beneficial in differentiation and doing the right kinds of work that reward our staff . " <p> Ellis-Jones said it was still early days for the practice of shared value , and the Shared Value Project needs to continue to ensure that the concept is clear and well-known to Australian business and society . <p> " I think we 're still on an education path where we 've got some really strong endorsement and application among some leading corporations in certain sectors , but there 's a lot more opportunity there , " he said . <p> " I think the future will see new sectors come on the shared value journey , we will find more projects that are more specific to those industries occur , and I do hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their role in society . " <p> He said that one of the challenges that needs to be overcome is the continued resistance from some CSR practitioners . <p> " People have invested years and years in being a CSR expert and then overnight this new language came and threatened the platform they were on , " he said . <p> " So even now we 've still got lots of people who do n't know what this is even though they 're in senior roles in corporate responsibility . <p> " I think what we 're going to see over the next few years is continued understanding , broader awareness , more people choosing to train in this space and more projects .

 Think Creatively about Creating Shared Value <p> Creativity in strategy , partnerships and communication must be a driving force behind the implementation of shared value , writes Scott , Head of Strategy at Republic of Everyone . <p> Creativity , imagination , flair , art . The domain of artists , musos and wannabe artists now sitting in design and creative agencies , right ? <p> Well , maybe . But the practice of creativity is bigger than that . In fact , in IBM 's survey of over 1,500 CEOs worldwide , " creativity " came out as the single most important leadership competency for enterprises seeking to navigate our increasingly complex business landscape . <p> And what better place to bring creativity into your business than through the process of creating shared value ( CSV ) . <p> Here are three areas we think creativity can help you create shared value : <p> business models <p> stakeholder engagement <p> communications . <p> Creative business models <p> We 're creatures of habit . We like doing the same things . Doing them in the same way . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Most of us take the same route to work every day , sleep on the same side of the bed , get cranky when our partner sleeps on our side of the bed , and so on . <p> We get comfort out of surety and of knowing how things will respond . There 's no shame in that . But in the business world it takes on a whole other level . There 's a way of doing things ... a model for success ... internal structures and processes that ... that all makes it hard for businesses to embrace new thinking or new practices . <p> So , if your business is focusing more on the " what " and " how much " , try switching that focus to the " why " . <p> There are some great examples of business models built on the " why " . Thankyou , Who Gives a Crap ? and Good Spender are just a few . Awesome businesses like these are focused on the change they seek to create in the world . They start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , they 're open to considering various business models , technologies and networks to help achieve the desired social change . And they 're able to evolve along the way too , diversifying their business models , because people are already behind them helping achieve the social change too . That 's how what started as Thankyou water , soon became Thankyou muesli and hand wash . <p> So , if you 're feeling bogged down by your existing business model , try bringing the " why " ( back ) into the equation . <p> Creative engagement <p> Partnerships have long been utilised to create social impact . Businesses and NGOs frequently come together on shared interests like Good Start Breakfast Club with Red Cross and Sanitarium giving kids who miss out on breakfast a healthy start to the day . <p> These partnerships are great , and philanthropy or " strategic philanthropy " is a hugely vital piece in the social impact world . <p> With CSV being a newer practice , a new set of skills are required from both corporates and charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collaboration to multiple partners diversifying the engagement and getting the wisdom of the crowd ? <p> For a project we run , The 202020 Vision ( whose " why " is to increase urban green space 20 per cent by 2020 ) , we went beyond thinking about the corporates , NFPs and consultants . It was definitely important to get these people on board , but the best engagement happened when we opened it up to anyone who wanted to help be part of the change . This gave us much richer perspectives on how to achieve change , and a wider network of collaborators ( now over 320 ! ) to help achieve that change . <p> So , if you 're not quite sure who or how to engage , try opening up the collaboration at the very least you 'll get some useful feedback on your shared value idea . <p> Creative communications <p> Communications in the CSR space can be delicate , if not dangerous , territory . Let 's face it , people are suspicious of businesses getting a financial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no different . To do it well needs skill . If it was a recipe , I 'd say it was one part WIIFM ( what 's in it for me ) , one part ( what 's in it for we ) , mixed in with a bit of participation , all baked into a social movement . <p> There are quite a few good examples of this sort of communication . One of our projects , the Garage Sale Trail , shows how this recipe can work . <p> Garage Sale Trail is actually about reducing waste . It came from a brief for us to help stop Bondi residents dumping household goods on the curbsides . But people do n't want to hear about that . So we wanted to create something that had WIIFM , , offered people the chance to participate and grew into a social movement . <p> The WIIFM was simple make money from selling your junk ( sellers ) and find hidden treasure ( buyers ) . The was about increasing community connectedness and getting to know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing . <p> The participation was turned into an event with maps and trails from one garage sale to another . And the social movement came from carefully crafted social media , PR and the thousands of interesting people who took part and made it their own platform for community togetherness . Garage Sale Trail has grown from a Waverley Council initiative into a nationwide community event across 164 local councils , with 13,191 registered garage sales and 66,615 long-term community connections made . <p> Communities love Garage Sale Trail because it 's a community event where the WIIFM is as important as the . As one happy camper said : " I used to not know my neighbour three doors away ... now we say hello in the street and she 's wearing my jeans . " <p> So , if you 're starting to think about communicating your initiative , have a think about how the WIIFM and the work together . <p> We know creativity 's important . And thinking creatively can help us down the path to creating shared value . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes will start to create new value for your business and those around it . <p> About the author : Scott is one of the partners and Head of Strategy of Everyone .

 a Social Ventures Incubator Program <p> By Anantula , <p> The City of Adelaide showed incredible foresight and leadership last year when it tendered for a social enterprise incubator in Adelaide a free program to help startups to develop and implement new business models , writes business strategist . <p> You may be thinking : city council , Adelaide , social enterprise ? How did these three things come together ? Adelaide is going through a significant change right now . <p> There is an increasing sense of despair when you read through the papers on job losses and at the same time people living here are seeing a more vibrant city .

 Clickability <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Two social workers concerned about the lack of information on NDIS services , and their quality , have created an online directory of ratings and reviews , writes Ellie Cooper in this week 's Spotlight on Social Enterprise . <p> Jenna Moffat and Aviva Beecher Kelk were working as case managers in disability and mental health when they noticed a lack of transparent information about support options available to their clients . <p> " We really saw in that work that there was a lack of consumer-focused information and a lack of peer-generated information , " Moffat said . <p> " And we found that in our roles that was really lacking and if we did n't have access to that then the community certainly did n't have access to that . <p> " We just did n't feel that was right ... we felt like we were gatekeepers of the information that we did end up collecting and that did n't sit well with our values . " <p> When the National Disability Insurance Scheme was announced , Moffat and Beecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information necessary to make informed choices about their support . <p> " We saw that kind of information was going to be really crucial in realising the values that are underpinning the NDIS of choice and control , " Moffat said . <p> " Without that type of information economy people really would n't have informed choice , and would n't be able to autonomously search for services and have information about what 's available . " <p> Moffat said they also wanted to create a way for users could share the quality of the services they received . <p> " One of the things that we noticed in our work was around the quality of services . All these providers were having audits , but that information just was n't made public , and it was really left to people who worked in the sector to know who was who , and what the quality was like , " he said . <p> In 2014 , the pair founded Clickability , an online directory similar to Tripadvisor , to help people with disability choose and purchase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directory that also features ratings and reviews ... so we populate the site with NDIS registered service providers , and other service providers as we come across them , " Moffat said . <p> " Then the service providers have the opportunity to subscribe and that gives them administrative rights over their listing . <p> " Regardless of subscription , it 's a functional directory and people can rate and review service providers so that that information economy is being created , and then our revenue comes from that subscription model and from service providers wanting to engage with that feedback . " <p> She said that there are a few NDIS directories available with " varying degree of helpfulness " , but nothing that includes consumer-driven information . <p> Currently the site is in beta , and the enterprise is in the early days of generating a revenue from the subscription service , but Moffat is confident that it will become financially sustainable . <p> Clickability is following the tried and tested expansion model of other successful user-generated content sites . <p> The service is currently in Victoria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Moffat said that they would aim to follow the NDIS rollout from there , depending on their rate of growth . <p> " We 're not wanting to move into a new area and stretch our resources until we 've saturated the one location , " she said . <p> " That 's coming off the back of research into other like-services , so Tripadvisor and Yelp and Facebook and all the social media sites , they 've all started with one geo-location and have waited until they 've saturated before they 've moved onto the next so we 're following that model . " <p> Moffat said that she and Beecher Kelk got the enterprise off the ground " through a lot of hard work and a lot of community support . " <p> The pair built the website and self-funded a minimum viable product , which they are still using today . They 've been upgrading it throughout the process and plan to add more features in the future . <p> The pilot was run in Victoria 's Barwon region for nine months , and in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about how both users and service providers would engage with it . <p> They have also received significant recognition from incubator programs , including a kickstarter program between the School of Social Entrepreneurs and Macquarie , which provided a grant to help fund the pilot , travel allowance support from GoGet , and , more recently , Australia Post who 've funded their participation in the Social Trader 's Crunch program . <p> However , they have faced the typical financial struggles of startups , with Moffat leaving her job and Beecher Kelk living off a PhD scholarship . <p> Moffat said that they have received volunteer support and mentoring from a team that has grown organically throughout the process . <p> " We 've really collected a beautiful team along the way . We have a number of people who work with us in a volunteer capacity , " she said . <p> " Most of them have lived experience with disability , either by having disability themselves or being in a carer role previously or some of them having worked in the sector and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said that a lack of experience has also been a challenge , but their team has provided guidance on how to develop Clickability . <p> " Both myself and Aviva do n't have experience doing this . It 's our first time setting up a social enterprise so we 're really feeling our way through and it 's been really intuitive , " she said . <p> " Sometimes hindsight has told us what we 've done could have been done better , but we 're learning so much along the way . " <p> But Moffat said the greatest uncertainty is that their social enterprise is built around the NDIS , which is also a new service . <p> " I think the other thing is we 're entering a market that does n't really exist yet , the NDIS has n't actually rolled out into Victoria , so we 're kind of pre-empting the changes that are going to occur and that 's been difficult because we 're really at the front end of this cultural change , and so our market is n't full yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment is a big culture shift that 's happening in the sector , and this is the idea of people with disabilities going from being clients and users of services , into customers directing their care a bit more . " <p> She said that providing users with feedback and helping them understand their consumer rights will have a significant social impact . <p> " We 've seen the impact of it already , every time we speak to consumers about their experience with service providers and about their experience of reviewing , and hear about the amazing services that are out there that are n't being celebrated . <p> " That 's something that keeps me motivated as well , is wanting to really support the services that are doing well , and lifting the whole sector to that standard that 's the ultimate goal .

 for NFP Reform <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The peak body for company directors in Australia is calling for a national reform agenda for Not for Profit organisations around regulation , the harmonisation of the definition of " charity " across all jurisdictions and five year government funding agreements . <p> The Australian Institute of Company Directors ( AICD ) has released a new report , Governance of the Nation : A Blueprint for Growth , which details reform priorities that could be implemented over the next two years to generate better economic and social outcomes . <p> In terms of the Not for Profit sector , the blueprint recommended improved funding certainty with a best practice model of five year cycles , 12-month notice periods , freedom to voice their concerns in public debates and an investment in internal capabilities . <p> " NFPs are subject to fractured and complex regulatory and funding arrangements , " the AICD 's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer , John Brogden , said . <p> " Financial sustainability continues to be the number one concern for NFP directors , consistently highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Short-term and fluctuating funding cycles work against long-term planning and good governance . " <p> The AICD report said it was also concerned about the risks that NFP directors incur as funding arrangements are changed , withdrawn or delayed , exposing entities to the potential for insolvent trading . <p> " To foster an innovative and responsive sector , NFPs need a regime that is flexible , fit for purpose and geared towards improving productivity and outcomes driven results , " the report said . <p> It recommended national fundraising law reform as part of COAG 's national reform agenda including the adoption of the " report once , use often " model across federal agencies within a year , and a greater use of and access to aggregate government data to improve outcomes measures and enhance benchmarking of effectiveness . <p> " NFP organisations navigate a changing operating environment while managing the expectations of stakeholders from government , regulators and the community , " it said . <p> " This is a challenging environment for NFP boards .

 Connect with Journalists <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> A lack of time , resources and understanding of the media is hindering charities in generating good news coverage , according to the UK author of a new book . <p> Authored by Becky Slack , a UK social affairs journalist , and produced in conjunction with peak body CharityComms , the book claimed that charity media managers are finding it difficult to place stories due to a lack of interest from the media , poor contacts , and a belief that the media is mostly interested in negative or sensationalist stories . <p> " These were some of the findings from a recent survey of 125 charities by CharityComms , which asked charity PRs to select their top three challenges when securing press coverage for their stories , " Slack said . <p> The responses showed that a lack of time and resources were the most common issues for charity media teams , with 59 per cent of respondents admitting to these problems . <p> However , the survey also found a group of results that implied there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of respondents who said journalists were n't interested in their stories . Another 25 per cent said journalists only want negative stories , not positive news ; and many also cited a demand for " attractive " or " high profile " case studies or " dramatic , sensationalist , ridiculous " stories . <p> The survey found that one in five ( 20 per cent ) said they did not know who to contact to get media coverage . <p> A spokesperson for the author said the survey results were likely to be the same in a number of other countries including Australia . <p> " Charities do not always receive the positive coverage they need and deserve . At the same time , the response to the recent media furore in the UK has shown that charities have found it very difficult to cope when coverage turns sour , " she said . <p> " Charities need to be able to respond to media requests quickly , relinquish control of the message and think more like journalists if they are to secure more and better media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that think like journalists . <p> " PR should not be an extension of your marketing department . Working with the media is about a genuine opportunity to engage with wider audiences on the issues that matter to charities . <p> " If charities want coverage they have to work fast . They have to provide journalists with what they want , when they want it and in the format they want it in . <p> " If charities want to avoid more negative coverage in the media , they need to communicate how they operate . News is something that is new , shocking or surprising . Charities need to be transparent so the way they work becomes normalised . " <p> Chief Executive of CharityComms , Vicky Browning , said the UK charity sector provided a vast range of services which help improve the wellbeing of society . <p> " However , for a number of reasons , it has to be accepted that the sector as a whole is neither generally well understood by the public , nor is it always applauded for its work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of how best to make the most of their resources to deliver a more effective media strategy .

 at 83c to Every <p> Australia has a gender pay gap of 17.3 per cent , where women earn 83 cents for every a man makes , according to a new international report . <p> The Glassdoor Economic Research report , Demystifying the Gender Pay Gap , analysed hundreds of thousands of salaries in Australia , the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany and France . <p> The Australian data , from a survey sample of more than 4,000 employees , found that the gender pay gap was slightly lower than the Australian Workplace Gender Equality Agency estimate of 17.9 per cent in 2015 . <p> It found that the average base pay in Australia was $99,940 per year for men and for women , which amounted to a gender pay gap of $15,722 . <p> Unlike most studies , however , the Glassdoor report also included statistical controls , including a personal characteristics , job title , company , industry , designed to make an " apples to apples " comparison , which resulted in a smaller pay gap . <p> The report found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and years of experience , the gender pay gap shrunk to 12 per cent for base pay . <p> Including additional controls for company and job title , the adjusted gender pay gap was just 3.9 per cent for base pay . <p> " The gender pay gap is real , both in the US and around the world . Men earn more than women on average in every country we examined , both before and after adding statistical controls , " report author and Glassdoor chief economist , Dr Andrew Chamberlain said . <p> To further explain what causes the discrepancy , the report divided the overall gap into an " explained " and " unexplained " criteria . <p> The explained gap was due to differences between workers , while the unexplained gap could be due either to workplace discrimination , whether intentional or not , or unobserved worker characteristics . <p> In Australia the " explained " part of the gender pay gap was 61 per cent , leaving 39 per cent of the pay gap " unexplained " .

 Record Pledge <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The youngest son of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett has made the largest commitment ever made by a private foundation pledging US$90 million ( A$120 million ) to address issues of inequality facing young women of colour in the US . <p> The NoVo Foundation , created in 2006 by husband and wife Jennifer and Peter Buffett , said the commitment was to support and deepen the movement for girls and young women of colour in the US over seven years . <p> The foundation said the funds would support grassroots programming and advocacy , as well as national-level policy and culture change efforts , that are girl-led , girl-driven and designed to address the systemic and institutional challenges faced by these girls and young women across the country . <p> As part of the process for identifying how to invest this US$90 million commitment , NoVo said it would launch a series of regional learning sessions in different locations to hear directly of their experiences and those of advocates . <p> " Inherently , girls and young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is about dismantling the barriers that prevent them from realising that potential and leading us toward a truly transformative movement for change , " co-president of the NoVo Foundation , Jennifer Buffett , said . <p> Co-president , Peter Buffett said : " Our goal is to create the conditions for change by advancing the work of the real experts in this movement girls and young women of colour and the advocates working with them . " <p> They said that central to the design of NoVo 's emerging work is the belief that this cohort are experts in their own lives and must be invested in as they lead efforts to transform systems of inequity . <p> Peter and Jennifer Buffett were named in Barron 's list of top 25 most effective philanthropists in 2009 and 2010 . <p> " Across philanthropy and far beyond , we see unprecedented potential to ensure that girls and young women of colour finally move from invisibility to investment , " Executive Director of the NoVo Foundation , Pamela Shifman , said . <p> " Now is our chance to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into long-term , meaningful change .

They 're also more likely to suffer child sexual abuse , be sexually harassed on the street and at school , and experience dating violence , " she said . <p> Shifman said that despite the data there was a persistent and widespread notion in the United States that they were doing fine . <p> " That 's an incredibly dangerous myth , and it 's standing in the way of ensuring that girls and young women of colour are the focus of the research , investment and action they so urgently deserve .

 Rise in Philanthropy <p> Wealth creation may be slowing but the world 's mega rich are planning to grow their philanthropy and be more strategic about giving , according to a new wealth report . <p> Global property network , Knight Frank , released its 10th anniversary global Wealth Report that looks at the attitudes of the ultra wealthy according to their advisers . <p> Although protecting their wealth is a preoccupation for many ultra high net worth individuals ( UHNWI ) , giving much of it away is also important , the survey found . <p> On average , 67 per cent of those who took part in the Attitudes Survey said their clients ' philanthropic activities had increased over the past 10 years , with almost 80 per cent saying activity would increase further over the next 10 years . <p> " A sense of personal fulfilment was cited as the main motivator , although in the Middle East religious beliefs were considered almost as important .

 Sector at Highest Ever Concentration <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Australia has the largest number of charities per capita in its history , with one charity for every 422 people , a new report has revealed . <p> The report also tracked the growth of the now billion per year sector over the past 20 years . It found that the number of charities was doubling every two decades , with 56,894 charities in Australia . <p> Australia 's charity concentration was compared to the US , where there is one charity per 648 Americans . Australian charities also face more significant donor funding challenges , with only 0.23 per cent of individuals giving as a percentage of GDP , compared to 1.44 per cent in the US . <p> Wealth management firm JBWere released the Cause Report on Tuesday , the first major in-depth look at the state of Australia 's Not for Profit industry from the corporate sector . <p> " There is no question that Australia 's charity sector , which helps the most vulnerable and needy people in Australia and overseas , is crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " But after two decades of strong growth , the sector is fast approaching a crossroads . With overall spending growing at about 8.4 per cent a year since 1996 , and the sector facing potentially tighter funding models , something has to change . " <p> Grenier 's statement followed calls from sector leaders late last year calling for charities to merge or shut down because too many are wasting valuable resources competing with each other . <p> The report found that the sector also faces a shrinking and ageing volunteer workforce , with many charities struggling to attract younger people . <p> " There are real concerns around where the sector 's next generation of supporters will come from , " Greiner said . <p> " Everything comes back to the need for the sector to consolidate its operating models , through reinvigorating the way activities are carried out in Australia . <p> " The report shows us that charities and Not for Profits are not operating productively as they could be within the sector , leading to the uneven distribution of assets and services for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the biggest opportunities for the Not for Profit sector lies with corporate Australia , and that charities need to " rethink " the way they engage corporates . <p> " There is a real opportunity for businesses to become a ' skilled partner ' to charitable organisations , " he said . <p> " Rather than focusing on well-intended philanthropy , we need to focus on structured , strategic partnerships that benefit both parties in keeping with a shared-value approach . <p> " At the end of the day , in order for the Australian charity sector to work productively and thrive , we need to prompt a sensible sharing of assets and knowledge between Not for Profits , corporate supporters and individual donors . <p> " It 's only then that we will be able to evolve as an industry and ensure we produce the greatest impact both here and overseas .

 Opposes Changes to Ancillary Funds <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The Not for Profit members of a group set up to advise the Prime Minister on issues relating to philanthropy and giving have opposed a controversial Treasury recommendation to change the current distribution rates for Ancillary Funds . <p> The non-government members of the Prime Minister 's Community Business Partnership have made a submission to the Commonwealth 's Treasury amendments to the Private Ancillary Fund Guidelines 2009 and the Public Ancillary Fund Guidelines 2011 . <p> Convenor of the Partnerships Innovation and Culture working group , Alexandra Gartmann , said the group was in favour of recommendations around the reduction in red tape and barriers to giving and volunteerism , and were broadly supportive of the proposed amendments to the guidelines . <p> " Our submission does not , however , recommend a change to the current distribution rates for Ancillary Funds , " Gartmann said . <p> " The partnership does not believe there is a strong case for changing the currently accepted rate of 5 per cent for PAFs and 4 per cent for PuAFs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partnership by the Australian Taxation Office shows that 56 per cent of PuAFs and 46 per cent of PAFs distribute above the minimum distribution rate . Administration costs for PuAFs are 4.7 per cent of the fund 's net assets , with PAF administration costs at 1 per cent of the fund 's net assets . " <p> It said the current guidelines were simple and easy to understand and are broadly accepted by both the AF providers and the charitable sector that receives the funds . <p> " The recommended changes introduce a level of complexity and uncertainty that is not warranted at this stage . The partnership believes there is a case for making the distribution rate the same for PuAFs and PAFs at 5 per cent but it should be noted that there are many differing strategies for disbursements of funds and the average Ancillary Funds distributes in excess of the minimum amount already . " <p> Earlier this year the Turnbull Government was warned against changing the minimum annual distribution required by philanthropic funds . <p> The Community Council for Australia ( CCA ) wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from a proposal to change the minimum annual distribution percentage for PAFs and . <p> The changes would mean that ancillary funds could distribute the average of the Reserve Bank of Australia 's target for the cash rate . <p> But the CCA said this could " weaken the need to focus on this primary charitable purpose and allow PAFs and to be driven by their capacity to gain a return on their investments seems to be giving almost equal importance to the purpose of making a profit on investments " . <p> " Whether PAFs and PuAFs generate a substantial or minimal profit in any particular period should not be the driver of their purpose , " the CCA said . <p> " Whether PAFs and PuAFs can wear the fluctuations of particular investment markets and maintain their investment funds at a set level over time is not the key factor in whether or not the fund delivers a benefit to the community . " <p> The Prime Minister 's Community Business Partnership , originally set up by the former Howard government and reformed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government about practical strategies to foster a culture of philanthropic giving , volunteering and investment . <p> The non-government member submission to Treasury also included some additional suggestions related to portability for Private Ancillary Funds removing duplications in reporting to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and the Australian Taxation Office , updating investment strategy rules , encouraging the inclusion of social impact investing structures and program related investments in the guidelines , and loan guarantees over borrowings of Deductible Gift Recipients . <p> " We highlighted the need for broader legislative changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 , to enable Ancillary Funds to distribute to other Ancillary Funds . This will enable the pooling of resources to meet a large need from a community or charity , for example if a regional disaster arises , " the submission said . <p> " The Partnership is also concerned that the proposed change to Schedule 2:24:50 may have the unintended consequence of reducing portability by preventing a PuAF sub fund from being transferred to PAF . <p> " Many people commence their philanthropic journey by establishing a sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and involved and the contributions to the fund grow they have a corpus that is more suitable to be managed as a PAF . The Partnership would be keen to see this pathway encouraged and portability made as simple as possible . <p> " Allowing to accept distributions from other Ancillary Funds is also critical to the proper functioning of portability . This is referenced above with the need for legislative change to allow PAFs to donate to Item 2 DGR Community Foundations and other PuAFs .

 Affordable Housing Fund <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> Welfare Not for Profit , the St Vincent de Paul Society , has urged bipartisan support for a national plan that would establish a billion affordable housing fund to help fix the country 's growing homelessness crisis . <p> Vinnies National Council has released a paper , The Ache for Home , which contains a housing and homelessness plan with policy recommendations aimed at addressing statistics that show that more than 100,000 people experience homelessness each night . <p> The paper 's key recommendations to the Federal Government are : 1 ) The establishment of a billion Social and Affordable Housing Fund . 2 ) The preparation of a National Housing Plan . 3 ) The recognition of the human right to housing . 4 ) The setting of new targets to halve homelessness and halve the housing shortfall by 2025 . <p> Vinnies Chief Executive , Dr John Falzon said having a place to call home was something that everyone should be able to experience . <p> " Currently , this is not the case . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and affordable housing that must be urgently addressed , " Dr Falzon said . <p> " The St Vincent de Paul Society is presenting all sides of politics with an election year challenge to fix Australia 's housing and homelessness crisis . <p> " A billion injection of funds into social and affordable housing can be paid for responsibly by reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax along with already-identified changes to superannuation tax concessions and the closing of tax loopholes .

 Why Being Chair is not Mundane for Mundine <p> Warren Mundine has become a powerful spokesperson for Australia 's indigenous community .

It 's a very simple basis of getting indigenous kids to go into a boarding school situation and then moving onto tertiary studies . <p> It started out as a boys program but then we saw the need for girls to be involved and it has grown from there . That 's the work that it 's doing but now it 's expanding more into working out how to provide the mentoring and the support that is needed for kids . <p> What 's your board 's ultimate goal ? <p> The ultimate goal is to build the foundation that is working with 2,000 indigenous kids , boys and girls , across Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal to be successful and to get the marks that get them into the studies that they choose and then build a career path from that . It 's about how do we make education central to people and then how does that play a role in lifting people out of poverty and the economic development of communities . <p> What 's been the highlight of your work with the AIEF so far ? <p> The biggest highlight for me are the kids . They 're just amazing . You bring these kids in from country towns , rural Australia and some of the poorest areas of our urban centres and they just thrive . They take up the opportunities and the challenges that are there . They 've been very successful and I just find it amazing when I look at those kids because they 're probably 10 or 12 times better than what I was when I was there age . That bodes well for the future . <p> The recent Closing the Gap Report gave a fairly mixed review of Australia 's performance , what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible progress ? <p> The big things are in regard to the fact that we need to have an indigenous economic strategy . I 've had this conversation with the Prime Minister and it 's important that education , jobs and employment are central to that . The government and indigenous people need to be focussed on getting our kids to school , getting them educated and then also to look at creating businesses and enterprises in our communities which create the jobs that people can fill . Once we do that we 're able to close the gap . <p> You chair quite a few boards at other organisations . What is it that attracts you to that kind of role ? <p> It is about change . One of the things that we at the AIEF put out there is that we 're here to change a nation and the news about changing a nation is that it 's making the world a better place for our people and for Australia .

It get 's me out of bed in the morning and puts a smile on my face . <p> You also chair the Prime Minister 's Indigenous Advisory Council . How has the dialogue around indigenous issues changed since the change of PM ? <p> It 's very much changed towards looking at our economic strategies . Yes , the previous prime minister showed a big focus in this area and had some very good policies that would create more indigenous businesses . But this Prime Minister also gets it . He comes from a business background , he comes from a banking background , so he knows how you create the opportunities , the environment where indigenous businesses and employment can grow . <p> The AIEF is a Not for Profit and there are a lot of other Not for Profits working with indigenous issues .

 : Three things NFPs Ca n't Afford to Forget <p> As charities begin to prepare for the end of the financial year , their is one important asset that they often overlook , writes Richenda Vermeulen , Director of digital consultancy ntegrity . <p> In our four years as an agency , we 've conducted almost 100 digital audits of Australian charities . When it comes to big campaign times , can you guess what the most common issue is ? <p> Donor conversion . <p> Traffic is driven to the website or special campaign landing pages , but very little actually converts . Not for Profits too often spend thousands sometimes millions on the approach , but they fall short where it matters most . <p> Why does this happen ? <p> Not for Profits invest huge amounts of time , energy and money on creative ideas for their campaigns that end up being almost indistinguishable from the next charity . Then they spend up big on media buying to ensure everyone sees their campaign . In the process , these organisations do n't take the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So as you head into one of the most important donation periods in the charity calendar tax time and winter here are the three key things to focus on the get the best ROI from your appeal . <p> 1 . Make donating easy <p> As a starting point , and regardless of how you choose to engage and compel people in your campaigns , always ensure it takes no more than two clicks to donate . <p> Do n't make assumptions about what motivates donors and what will work . You may be using language or missing an essential part of the picture . An objective outsider or digital marketing specialist will be able to verify this for you as will data on traffic behaviour . <p> Then , the simplest way to check whether the user experience of your donate or landing page is working is to get some people to test it for you . Are they easily able to make it from A to B ? Do they have any questions that are n't answered ? <p> 2 . Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who see your ads or arrive on your website are evaluating whether they 'll donate to your or your competitors . They are actively evaluating you against other charities , so you need to give them an incredibly compelling reason not to consider anyone else . <p> This could be as simple as clearly articulating the impact of every dollar : where it will go , who it will help , and how . Resist the urge to always talk about yourself by ensuring each line of copy speaks first to the user . How will they be able to positively impact someone 's life in a simple way ? <p> 3 . Turn once off donations into regular giving <p> For most NFPs , once-off donations only account for a small percentage of their overall donations . It 's recurring donations that really keep them afloat ! <p> Do n't hedge all your bets on campaigns , but make sure you set your sights on building relationships that last all-year-round with an " always on " approach . <p> Include an option to give monthly , show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , and make the sign-up process easy . <p> About the author : Richenda Vermeulen is the Director of ntegrity , a digital consultancy that helps NFPs implement innovative solutions to improve fundraising and communications .

 Reform of Justice System <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> A new research report from leading Not for Profit aid agency Australian Red Cross has called for a radical shift in the justice system , redirecting funds away from imprisonment and into crime prevention . <p> The Australian Red Cross 2016 Vulnerability Report Rethinking Justice called on all governments in Australia to put justice reinvestment at the centre of justice policy . <p> " Justice reinvestment is a cost-effective alternative to what we 're currently doing , which is not working , costing us billions and is fundamentally inhumane , " newly appointed Red Cross Chief Executive Officer Judy Slatyer said . <p> " Justice reinvestment means money is diverted from building and running more and more prisons into strengthening disadvantaged communities to address the issues that lead to criminal behaviour in the first place . <p> " The number of people in prison has doubled in the last 20 years . Overcrowded prisons are costing us billion a year to run . So it makes sense to reduce the flow into prisons , rather than building more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime including poor mental health , poor education and employment prospects , homelessness , domestic violence and alcohol and other drug abuse . " <p> The report has made five recommendations , including that all governments jointly commit to justice reinvestment through the Council of Australian Governments ; that they fund justice reinvestment trials in areas of high rates of crime ; and they commit to a 10 per cent reduction in adult imprisonment rates over the next 10 years , with a 50 per cent reduction target for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within five years . <p> said a disproportionate number of highly disadvantaged people ended up in prison . <p> " It 's estimated prisoners are up to three times more likely to have mental illness and up to 15 times more likely to have a psychotic disorder . Another study has found 42 per cent of male prisoners and 33 per cent of female prisoners have an acquired brain injury , " she said . <p> " Crime is higher in more disadvantaged postcodes , where there 's entrenched poverty , segregation and residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of prison even more disadvantaged . And this also hits innocent families and communities . When a child loses a parent to the prison system this becomes an intergenerational problem . <p> said the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prisons must be urgently tackled . <p> " Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are being incarcerated at rates 13 times greater than non-Indigenous people.There has been an extraordinary recent growth in prisoner numbers among Indigenous people of 88 per cent since 2004 , " she said . <p> " This reflects the broader disadvantage faced by many Indigenous people , and is another persuasive reason why resources must be diverted to those communities if we are to turn around these shameful trends . " <p> She said while prisons were a necessary part of society , the data showed that they were neither effective at rehabilitation , nor were they deterring crime . <p> " Of the 42,239 people released from Australian prisons in 2013/14 almost 60 per cent had previously been released from prison only to return , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-imprisoned within two years of their release . By any measure that 's not a good return on an investment . " <p> Red Cross calculated that substantial funds could be freed up by justice reinvestment . <p> " If the rate of incarceration were simply held at current levels through justice reinvestment and other reforms , savings of billion would be generated over five years , " the report said . <p> " If the rate of incarceration were reduced by 2 per cent a year savings of billion could be made over five years . Part of these savings could be invested in the social and health services that would , over time , address many of the underlying causes of crime . " <h> First Line Up 
 NDIS Housing NFP Report <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> Using the NDIS to address the large housing shortage for people with disability will depend on the ability of housing providers to access significant amounts of capital from the private financial market , according to a new analysis . <p> Research based philanthropic organisation The Summer Foundation collaborated with private financial institutions , National Australia Bank , Commonwealth Bank and JBWere , to determine how different NDIS housing payment structures would impact on a housing provider 's ability to access finance to build more units of housing . <p> The Summer Foundation said it initiated the consultation to help formulate decisions on financing its next housing demonstration projects , and to inform and shape government policy and funding related to housing for people with disability . <p> The design of NDIS housing payments should enable financial institutions to lend against the future stream of income from these payments . <p> The report said that if lenders can not secure loans against NDIS payments , it will require loans to be secured against property which effectively lowers the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be attached to the dwelling and paid regardless of whether a participant is residing in the dwelling . <p> " If this is not possible for all housing payments , the report said , a payment guarantee should at least exist for highly modified dwellings funded in the early years of the Scheme . " <p> According to the report housing providers have very few tools to manage occupancy risk given that the NDIA determines whether someone is a participant and whether they get a housing payment in their plan . <p> " If housing providers bear the full occupancy risk we expect to see either very expensive financing rates or very limited construction of dwellings for young people exiting aged care , " it said . <p> " If governments want to introduce some element of risk sharing we would recommend that housing providers bear risk for a defined number of weeks after which the NDIA bears the occupancy risk . For example , the housing provider bears the occupancy risk for the first 4 weeks after which the NDIA bears the risk . " <p> The length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 25 years . <p> The report said that assuming a useful life of a building of approximately 25-30 years it is therefore appropriate for the NDIA to make a funding commitment for the majority of the dwelling 's life . <p> " Shorter contract terms will limit a housing provider 's access to finance and require refinancing , which will raise the cost of delivering NDIS housing . " <p> Adaptable design for a range of abilities ( alternate use of assets ) . <p> The report said housing that is highly adaptable and suitable for people with disabilities and for the general population is more attractive to potential investors . <p> " Highly adaptable apartments or townhouses that are peppered throughout larger developments are much more attractive to potential investors than traditional group homes . We should prioritise creating adaptable housing that is equally attractive to the private market , while recognising that the private market may not fully value the additional cost of creating accessible housing . <p> " This gap between market value and cost of construction requires an ongoing funding commitment from the NDIS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing NDIS housing would create a stable , predictable and low risk investment . This will enable housing providers to access a larger sum of finance to address the enormous unmet capital needs of young people in residential aged care , " the report said . <p> Registrar of Indigenous 
 Teens Linked to Employment Prospects <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> Suffering from emotional problems in adolescence is an important risk factor for future joblessness , irrespective of socio-economic background , according to a new UK report . <p> Academics at the University of Stirling in the UK examined the employment patterns of over 7,000 Americans over a 12 year period and found what they said was " clear evidence that distressed adolescents who tend to feel nervous or depressed rather than calm or happy subsequently experienced higher levels of joblessness in early adulthood " . <p> According to the report adolescents who were highly distressed at ages 16 to 20 were 32 per cent more likely to be unemployed and 26 per cent more likely to be unemployed or out of the workforce in early adulthood . <p> " The trends held , even when comparing distressed to non-distressed siblings , suggesting that emotional problems carry a heavy penalty even among brothers and sisters from the same background , " the report said . <p> The study also revealed that the adverse impact of psychological distress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 recession where those with a history of distress experienced a pronounced rise in joblessness . <p> Mark Egan of the Behavioural Science Centre at the University of Stirling said the findings provided strong evidence that distressed adolescents were vulnerable to unemployment and economic benefits could be gained by treating mental health issues in early life . <p> " Investing in childhood and adolescent mental health services could have economic benefits including reducing population-level unemployment . Widening access to effective treatments for early life distress could lead to large economic returns by helping individuals into employment and increasing their lifetime earnings , " Egan said . <p> The study , conducted by Mark Egan , Dr Michael Daly and Professor Liam Delaney of the University of Stirling , used data from over 7,000 American adults , drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 , born in 1980 -- 1984 . <p> The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , Skills Development Scotland , and the European Commission Marie Curie Initiative . @ @ @ predicts ' 
 Charity Restructures <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> The country 's longest running charity , The Benevolent Society , released its restructuring plans on Monday , with the aim of improving service delivery and doubling its operational revenue to almost million by 2019 . <p> Chief executive Jo Toohey said the organisational restructure was in response to the aged care and disability sector reforms , which presented opportunities for service growth and potential collaboration with like-minded organisations , including mergers and acquisitions . <p> " This means we will need to reorganise how we work , be more agile and be more strategic in our focus , " Toohey said . <p> " The new organisational structure , which will include a new executive structure to take effect from 1 June , is a blueprint for how we will deliver on our vision of a just society where all Australians can live their best lives . <p> " To continue our mission we must be successful in the provision of services which provide our organisation with revenue and focus on growing our commercial capability . <p> " The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership and capability over the next three years to focus on supporting our service delivery and operations , and delivering on critical components of our strategy . " <p> She said the organisation needed to become more consumer focused to stay competitive , and , as part of the restructure , two new leadership roles have been created to drive growth , actively seek business opportunities and double the organisation 's million revenue by 2019 . <p> An executive director of business development will lead the charity 's national growth strategy , and seek partnership opportunities and fundraising . A director of consumer engagement will focus on the attraction and retention of consumers , particularly in ageing and disability services . <p> " We are now working in a highly competitive environment where consumers can choose from a vast array of service providers , " Toohey said . <p> " Our strategic goal is to become a leading provider of healthy ageing services and home support for older people and people with disability . <p> " We will aim to increase our overall competitive advantage in the market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability services . <p> " The changes provide us an opportunity to flourish by leveraging our well-earned reputation over two centuries , working tirelessly for social justice and supporting vulnerable people . " <p> Toohey said that the charity would be " actively seeking merger , acquisition and partnership opportunities " in the ageing and disability sectors . <p> " Supporting those who are aging has also been a commitment of ours and this will continue with renewed vigour . <p> " Our new business model will focus on growing our market share in consumer home care across Australia , including regional and remote communities from early next year . <p> " Our work on how older Australians and those with a disability contribute to the richness of our community and economy remains steadfast . We aim to play a stronger role in shifting the current policy debate focussed on costs and burdens to empowerment and ability .

 Divide : Technology and Accessibility for People with Disability <p> By Staff Reporter , <p> Many Not for Profits with older websites will have to work hard to ensure that they are fully accessible to people with disability , writes CEO of the Diversity Council Australia , Lisa Annese . <p> We do n't need the Federal Government 's recent Innovation Statement that said advances in technology are transforming just about every part of our lives , from the way we work to the way we communicate and access services . It 's obvious and we are living it daily . <p> However advances in technology are also transforming the lives of people with a disability enabling more participation in things that were previously precluded from them , including many workplaces and other life activities . <p> The move towards societal inclusion for such individuals has a radical positive impact on people with a disability . However even though new technology products and services continue to expand at a seemingly exponential rate , accessibility is n't always built in and this is problematic . <p> There are compelling reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is accessible for people with a disability . As our population ages , the number of people living with disability will also increase . While some types of disability are acquired at birth or early in life , others can be the result of accident , illness , injury and the process of ageing throughout life . Disability rates increase substantially as people get older . Vision and hearing , for example , generally deteriorate with age . Up to 40 per cent of people will have some form of disability by the time they are 70 years old . <p> By making web-based products and services more readily available to those that have a visual , hearing or physical impairment , organisations have the opportunity to grow their share of an expanding market . This is both socially progressive and financially rewarding . <p> Moreover , offering a workplace that is accessible to people with a disability through accessible technology and other forms of accessibility will expand an organisation 's talent pool by enabling access to some of the most productive , motivated and loyal potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DCA ) workshop focussing on disability and the workplace , Sean Murphy , Compliance Accessibility Software Engineer at Cisco , outlined some of the common barriers to accessible technology for web based products . <p> These include : <p> a lack of proper keyboard navigation to move logically through a software product by using the tab and shift+tab keys <p> information overload , where pages are overly busy without clear distinctions <p> excessive graphic interface , where screen readers are unable to identify and describe illustrative elements on a page <p> use of Flash technology that excludes best practises to support screen readers <p> poorly designed pages that do not consider contrast and colouring are also barriers for people with low vision or colorblindness . <p> Murphy recommends that international accessibility standards , as outlined by the Web Accessibility Initiative should be implemented at the design stage of website development . This is much simpler and more cost effective than trying to retrofit accessibility later . <p> Testing for proper accessibility is also essential and should be carried out by someone who actually has a disability ; people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a disability . <p> Many Not for Profits with older web-based platforms will have some work to do ensure greater accessibility . In this regard , DCA is working with the assistance of Cisco and our website provider , , to redesign the DCA website so it is more accessible as well as optimised for mobile and tablet use . <p> DCA is also sharing more information with member organisations in order to encourage them to do the same . There are many useful resources to help with the process of ensuring greater accessibility . Some of these include : <p> In this internet-dominated era , equitable access to information must take into consideration the diversity of web users , as well as the ways people use the internet . But beyond the equity argument , there is also a strong business case for inclusion of people with a disability in technology . Organisations that do both will be well placed to capture the benefits . <h> The History Of

 Switch ' to Boost Housing Affordability NFP <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> A partnership report by business and Not for Profit peak bodies has called for a switch from stamp duty to a remodelled land tax to boost housing affordability and jobs . <p> Making the switch from stamp duty to land tax would not only lower the cost of housing and reduce rents , but could also boost Gross State Product by more than 1 per cent and create up to 10,000 jobs , according to a new report from the New South Wales Council of Social Service ( NCOSS ) and the NSW Business Chamber . <p> Prepared by KPMG for the NSW Business Chamber and NCOSS , the report , Taking on Tax : Reforming NSW Property Taxes , outlines the benefits to the NSW economy of abolishing stamp duty on property transfers and gradually introducing a broad-based land tax . <p> The report said that in 2015/16 , conveyancing stamp duty was expected to generate more than billion for the NSW Government with a considerable share of this coming from residential property transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous decade with the level of stamp duty payable on the median Sydney house price now more than , around twice what it would have been a decade earlier , " the report said . <p> " As broad and diverse stakeholders , the switch appeals to each of us for different reasons ; but each agree that it is essential that stamp duty and land tax remain an active part of any conversation about tax reform . " <p> Under the switch , property owners would be subject to a redesigned land tax , but would no longer pay stamp duty when purchasing a property . While NSW already has a land tax system in place , the current system is " narrow " and does not apply to owner occupied land . <p> Under the switch a " broad " land tax would apply to owner occupied land in addition to those who already pay it .

 CSR ? <p> By Xavier Smerdon , Journalist <p> Corporate Social Responsibility " focuses more on boosting employee morale than addressing the way a company engages with society 's concerns " and should be replaced with a new model of engagement , according to a leading English businessman . <p> John Browne , a former chief executive of BP , has co-written a book in which he interviewed more than 70 business leaders on their perceptions of CSR . <p> In an article for the Harvard Business Review , he said that many of the business leaders view CSR commercially relevant . <p> " One big problem is CSR departments lack the participation of big-spending commercial functions and the input of managers on the ground who better understand the local context , " Browne said . <p> " Their programs focus on limiting the downside of reputational damage , not on the commercial upside of better stakeholder engagement . This means CSR initiatives tend to be short-lived , dependent as they are on the whims of senior executives rather than the value they deliver . " <p> In CSR 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " connected leadership " . <p> " It is not an academic hypothesis ; it is built on the collective wisdom of interviews with business , government , and third-sector leaders , as well as my own experience , " he said . <p> Browne laid out the four tenants of connected leadership that he said could help revolutionise the way companies engage with society . <p> The first was for businesses to map their world . <p> " This tenet calls on companies to be rigorous in analysing macroeconomic environments , public attitudes , and the company 's own behavior in order to identify , early on , the challenges it might face and the ways this might affect profitability , " he said . <p> Browne points to Shell as an example of a company effectively mapping its world by identifying 10 major drivers of change and assessing the respective value at a stake for the company and society . <p> " It measures the impact of these drivers across three horizons : the near-term financial impact , the long-term financial impact , and the impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can successfully apply this level of analysis , it will help them understand their stakeholders , calculate the value of external relationships , and help them tackle the second tenet of connected leadership . " <p> The second tenant Browne sets out is for companies to define and communicate their contribution to society . <p> " Purpose is the litmus test of sustainability in business , " he said . <p> " Companies that want to be around for decades to come must ensure that society is at the heart of everything they do . " <p> He said Unilever 's Sustainable Living Plan was a good example of this . <p> " It aims to double the size of the business while helping one billion people improve their health and wellbeing , halving the company 's environmental footprint , and enhancing suppliers ' livelihoods , " he said . <p> " These are not philanthropic ambitions . Each goal is tied to Unilever 's core business activity . Improving hygiene habits halves the number of people who die from disease and increases sales of its soap products ; reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's exposure to water-scarcity . " <p> His third tenant is to apply world-class management . <p> " Successfully embedding societal concerns deeply within business operations , as Unilever has done , requires a new approach to management at every level of the company from the boardroom to the shop floor , " he said . <p> " Companies need the right people with the skills and experience to incorporate external considerations into their decision making . <p> " However , there are only a handful of companies that do this proficiently . Less than a quarter of business executives interviewed by McKinsey reported having the management resources , talent and processes to engage with stakeholders effectively . " <p> Browne 's final tenant was to engage radically , ie engaging on someone else 's terms rather than a businesses ' own terms . <p> Browne said evidence showed that a company 's ability to engage successfully with stakeholders was worth over 20 per cent in superior stock performance over the course of a decade . <p> " Finding solutions to today 's greatest , global , social problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on the resources and innovation of business , " Browne said . <p> " The winning companies of the future will be those that successfully redefine their purpose and deploy their best teams in pursuit of these great social and environmental challenges .

 be confined to technology alone -- social enterprise uses innovative business models to " reorganise the system " and solve social issues , writes David Brookes , Managing Director of Social Traders . <p> Prime Minister Turnbull 's National Innovation and Science Agenda released in December last year represents positive political leadership in creating an Australia that values new ideas , business and technology . <p> Let 's not assume however , that innovation is limited to , or synonymous with , technology . <p> Charles Leadbetter , former adviser to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , social innovation thinker and renowned author of The Frugal Innovator Creating Change on a Shoestring , identifies that innovation is the recuperation of old ideas mixed with new approaches . <p> More often than not , the role of technology in innovation is to enable the reorganisation of existing resources and systems to deliver better outcomes . Citing AirBnB and Uber as examples , Leadbetter points out that neither hotels nor taxis were innovations per se ; but the way both Uber and AirBnB have re-organised the existing system within their respective industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitates the innovation but is not the innovation itself . <p> In this way , social enterprise itself also represents innovation since it finds new ways to solve problems . Often in the face of market failure , social enterprises provide employment and access to essential products and services by applying innovative business models . <p> In Australia there are a number of contemporary examples where social enterprises have demonstrated innovation to solve existing problems . The following two examples come from enterprises within Social Traders ' own Social Investment Portfolio . <p> To address the problem of poor access to healthy food in low socioeconomic communities , 2&amp;5 operate a shop in Norlane , Geelong , one of the most economically marginalised suburbs in Victoria . 2&amp;5 sell fresh , healthy food in an area that is unable to support a fruit and vegetable shop . To do this , they grow food on a local plot of land and use excess stock for pickling and making jams -- to sell at upscale markets in the region . They measure success by the kilograms of fresh produce sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible fresh food for a community that otherwise struggles to access it . Through this innovative approach they are able to keep costs down , minimise waste and provide a market-based solution to address the problem . <p> In inner Melbourne 's North Fitzroy , The Integrated Medical Centre ( TIMC ) is a medical practice owned and operated by community health service cohealth . TIMC has been established as a means of generating revenue for cohealth by doing what they do best -- providing healthcare . <p> By providing GPs , psychology , physiotherapy , pathology , podiatry and midwifery at market rates to the more affluent members of the local community , TIMC generates profit that funds community healthcare programs run by cohealth that are essential for those in the community most in need . By broadening its client base to encompass those that are more affluent and able to pay for medical services , TIMC has been able to take advantage of a market opportunity for the benefit of their traditional clients those that ca n't afford access to healthcare . <p> Healthcare and fresh food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , nor are the myriad of support services that provide access for those in need . The essence of the social enterprise innovation in both of these examples , is identifying where there are gaps in the traditional models of provision both the commercial market and welfare and finding new market-led approaches to address and solve these old problems . <p> In a recent article , Time for a National Agenda for Social Innovation , Rob Koczkar , CEO of Social Ventures Australia , advocates for greater focus at a national level towards exploring innovative approaches to solving the social challenges we face , such as unemployment , mental illness , homelessness and indigenous disadvantage . <p> As the intersection between traditional business and welfare , I believe that social enterprise needs to be recognised as part of the solution to solving these challenges . <p> This intersection is well depicted by social enterprise Thankyou which recently announced its new retail venture Thankyou Baby where the profits of nappies and baby products will fund maternal health projects in developing countries . The start-up capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowdfunding campaign . Just as with their original bottled water product , Thankyou is demonstrating innovation in its ability to generate capital via crowd funding as well as lead consumers to organise themselves around a product on the basis of understanding what its social impact will be . <p> By doing this , Thankyou is using successful , well-established retail categories to divert what would normally be personal profit for shareholders -- to address persistent problems in the developing world . <p> Through Social Traders national research , we know there are over 20,000 social enterprises in Australia operating in all industry sectors from tourism and transport to mining , hospitality and health services . We estimate that social enterprise contributes approximately 2 to 3 per cent of Australia 's GDP and employs up to 300,000 Australians .

 and Benefits Volunteering 's Bright Future ? <p> Volunteering Australia 's bi-annual national conference kicks of in Canberra , and CEO Brett Williamson outlines the future road for volunteering and some of the barriers to participation . <p> With most predictions pointing toward a federal election just months away -- and the federal budget announcement also brought forward to 3 May it is fitting that Volunteering Australia kicks off the biannual National Volunteering Conference with the nation 's volunteer managers and volunteers converging on the nation 's capital . <p> Over the next few days , representatives of the volunteering workforce from across Australia 's charitable and Not for Profit sectors will come together to hear from thought-leaders and weigh up the issues that matter most to them . <p> It 's a discussion that will carry particular weight in these coming weeks and months , and will feed into Volunteering Australia 's advocacy strategy for this election campaign . <p> Central to that discussion will be the views of the 2,304 people who were surveyed for Volunteering Australia 's newest State of Volunteering Report , which we officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report highlights , once again , that volunteering is a commitment to Australia 's national interest that does not come for free . <p> Ninety-nine per cent of volunteers surveyed would continue to engage in volunteering in the future , and 93 per cent of volunteers saw positive changes as a result of the contribution they were making . <p> Yet the absence of reliable resourcing for volunteering and in particular , volunteer management is a growing concern that has the potential to impact on Australian volunteering levels into the future . <p> Demand for volunteers continues to be greater than the number of volunteers available , with 86 per cent of organisations saying that they need more volunteers , and 30 per cent indicating that they were unable to engage the number of volunteers they were looking for due to the fact that there were not enough suitable candidates , or the organisation was unable to locate them . <p> Volunteers themselves indicate that the biggest barriers to volunteering in the future were work commitments ( 27 per cent ) and the overbearing cost of out of pocket expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a deterrent . <p> Another key finding of the report is that volunteers are not hearing back from volunteer involving organisations about opportunities fast enough , and that this deters them from participating . Though there is still much to do to address this problem , online platforms such as the EV CREW spontaneous emergency volunteering portal in Queensland and its sister program in Victoria , , together with national platforms such as GoVolunteer , are great examples of innovation in volunteer recruitment . <p> Volunteering Australia is always eager to see growth in the number of people participating in volunteering -- but the mismatch created when volunteer numbers grow whilst funding for volunteer management does not , is a genuine oversight . <p> We have seen this demonstrated in recent years , with a federal campaign to increase the number of volunteers in the aged services resulting in 55 per cent growth between 2000 and 2009 , but a 2011 Productivity Commission report calling for matching additional funding for volunteer management in the aged services , going unheeded . <p> The current consultation around the NDIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework likewise calls for an increase in the number of volunteers in the disabilities sector ; whilst the State of Volunteering Report does corroborate that a service gap exists in the number of volunteer positions available in disability services compared to the number of willing volunteers , it is not clear what extra resourcing exists to support any potential increase in volunteer workers . <p> As those of us in the sector well know , the reality is that new volunteers do not simply walk into site , pick up tools and get to work . Volunteering programs require effective recruitment , training , program development , management and oversight in order to be successful . These things can only be delivered through adequate funding . <p> Volunteering Australia 's recent Pre-Budget Submission touched upon these concerns , calling on the Government to address inequalities in federal funding for volunteering programs as compared to other programs resourced under the Department of Social Services . <p> Whilst the government has declared longevity to be a focus of their DSS grants restructure , and recently agreed that five-year funding agreements were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 volunteering programs were awarded with DSS grants of just twelve to eighteen months in length . <p> Volunteering Involving Organisations and Volunteer Support Organisations are rightly concerned by this inconsistency and will be watching the 2016/17 Federal Budget with great interest , hoping that the volunteering community continues to receive the growth in federal support it requires to deliver robust programs that benefit the national interest . <p> Volunteering Australia will be distributing the findings of the State of Volunteering Report to our nation 's leaders , and as the federal election approaches , we will continue our campaign to Australia 's federal representatives , asking them to recognise the value of volunteering . We hope that you will join us . <p> About the Author : Brett Williamson has been the CEO of Volunteering Australia since October 2013 .

 Cause <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> A cafe in the heart of Melbourne 's CBD is using a hands on approach to helping young people who face significant barriers to entering the workforce and developing skills and confidence , writes Ellie Cooper in this week 's Spotlight on Social Enterprise . <p> Eighteen months ago Youth Projects , a Not for Profit which provides health , education and training services to people experiencing disadvantage , opened its social enterprise , Good 2 Go . <p> Tucked into Hosier Lane , one of Melbourne 's premiere tourist destinations , the cafe is staffed by the organisation 's clients who receive mentoring in hospitality and life skills , as well as long-term plans to ensure they have the confidence and capability to go on to secure employment . <p> Chair of Youth Project 's board of directors , Melanie Raymond , said that the idea for Good 2 Go addressed a combination of imperatives . <p> " Charities needed to look to new income streams and use their assets more wisely , which meant that we had property in a high-value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that to better use , " Raymond said . <p> " But more importantly , as an organisation dedicated to providing opportunities to young people , particularly those facing disadvantage , we wanted to create the work experience opportunities that they were not getting access to and that were holding them back in the job market . <p> " So a social enterprise cafe where they could , for the first time in their lives , gain some real life work experience was a breakthrough for us in how we work with long-term unemployed young people . " <p> She said the concept development lasted for 12 months before the organisation " just dived in " , and budgeted the cost of the fit-out and employed a cafe manager to oversee the training . <p> " If we waited for it to be perfect , we 'd still be thinking about it today , " she said . <p> " We 're running a complex care facility ... employing doctors and nurses and social workers , and we were suddenly having to learn about the price of coffee beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big leap into something quite different , but we really learnt on our feet and it 's overwhelmingly been a successful experience with only a few hiccups along the way . " <p> While the profits from Good 2 Go are channelled into Youth Projects ' homelessness services , Raymond said the primary purpose of the enterprise is to help young people become job ready , while covering its operational cost . <p> " When you are working with young people who may be homeless , mentally i 'll , recovering from addictions ... they are going to take more time to work with , and more investment from us in getting them job ready , " she said . <p> " So often times our productivity is slowed as we really work intensively with young people to give them a chance . " <p> " We look for people who we know will not be able to experience work experience , to access work experience in the mainstream workforce . <p> " They 're people who have got multiple barriers , and we give them the opportunity to try a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamwork and expectations . " <p> The cafe is also located adjacent to the organisation 's primary health service , The Living Room , which provides cross-over support for workers . <p> " We have a range of experts on site at all times , which means we 're able to better support people who might have particular difficulties getting into work experience and job readiness , it 's unique in that respect , " Raymond said . <p> " So if a client is facing a difficulty and presents unwell , we 're able to pick that up very quickly . We 're sympathetic to the special needs and problems they might have , and support them through their transition into work readiness , rather than be very unsympathetic and blunt . <p> " That 's one of their worst fears , that they wo n't be treated well , they 'll be bullied and not respected . " <p> She said that the young people embraced the opportunity to work , and the impact on their lives quickly became apparent . <p> " Some of them have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very rapid turnaround in their interpersonal skills , where they are laughing , joking , feeling confident , taking on new aspects of the work , " she said . <p> " We target the soft skills that are so important to employers around eye-contact , self-confidence , communication , self-esteem and initiative so that they are suited to work anywhere . <p> " If you have boosted those areas then you 're going to perform much better at job interviews after the experience . All six of the first trainees have moved on into job readiness and employment , and we 're just starting a new intake of trainees now . " <p> Raymond also said that the Good 2 Go provides the young trainees with the chance to experience and adapt to a new environment . <p> " Many clients of ours who are in Melbourne 's south and north do n't have experience of coming into the city , it 's not that far away but it 's where the jobs are , so they 're feeling quite excluded , " she said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated and locked into an environment where no one in their neighbourhood has any access to upward social mobility . <p> " Broadening their horizons around job opportunities and the kinds of work they aspire to has been part of what we 're doing . " <p> The atmosphere of Good 2 Go is a significant part of its commercial and social success . Raymond said each day is full of " colour and movement " with a retro soundtrack that adds to the vibe of the laneway . <p> The cafe itself is frequented by tourists , Youth Projects clients from The Living Room , and other Melburnians . <p> It also sells art projects made by clients , as well as second-hand clothing with the proceeds going to the organisation 's women 's group . <p> There is an emphasis on involving Youth Project 's clients in the day-to-day life of the cafe . <p> " We run a lively pay-it-forward coffee scheme because it 's located in the same building as our primary health service , which means there could be 60 or 70 people a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are hungry and they are lonely , " Raymond said . <p> " So the capacity to be able to provide an outlet where they too can enjoy some of Melbourne 's finest coffee was something that we wanted to do as well . <p> " And the public responded very , very well -- and even tourists to the very simple idea of pay it forward for someone in need . " <p> Despite the rewarding nature of the social enterprise , Raymond said it 's not without its difficulties . <p> " You 've got all of the challenges of running a commercial enterprise matched with the challenges of running a charity , all at the same time , " she said . <p> " So our capacity to be commercially driven , yet give our employees much more time and space and investment in their well-being than might otherwise be the case in strictly commercial enterprise , has been one of the challenges . <p> " The governance of the social enterprise asks new questions of the board of directors , and brings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before around food safety and hygiene , around complying with the requirements of a major metropolitan council , and having staff exposed to a tonne of challenging behaviours on the street . " <p> Because Good 2 Go is designed to have a direct social impact , rather than serve as a purely commercial venture to drive revenue , the expectations of its profitability need to be managed . <p> " I think the revenue potential is too small to ever possibly fund high-impact programs , but there are a wide range of additional benefits that come with doing that , in terms of opening up opportunities for people who are marginalised , in terms of changing the way you think and changing the skillset of your employees , " Raymond said . <p> " Engaging in a social enterprise will put new pressures across the whole organisation from the board right through , so planning ahead and being absolutely committed throughout your organisation that this is what you 're going to do has to come first , it 's not something you can launch into on a whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and develop the enterprise , adding to both the revenue streams and the services for clients . <p> " The phase two will be expanding the menu and therefore the training experience for the young people we 're working with , " Raymond said . <p> " We 're also developing a range of products for the tourist market because over 2,000 tourists a day walk past our cafe ... so we recognise that we can tap into that as well . " <p> She said there are also plans for Youth Projects , as a Registered Training Organisation , to run other enterprises . <p> " We are going to link up the cafe experience with a new enterprise in Glenroy , at our headquarters there , and open up an expanded operation and run programs that involve clients in the production of food for sale in the cafe , " she said . <p> " You can have a group of women looking to overcome homelessness working in a life skills program that also teaches them cooking skills , and how to work behind the scenes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over what we can develop as a result of this , but also the learning is that we have other things that we do that can generate commercial income , so putting that lens over other intellectual property and assets that we hold where we could source similar possibilities .

 Needed to Save Great Barrier Reef <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> The Queensland Government gave the go ahead for the Adani coalmine as scientists warned that Australia is unlikely to meet water quality targets for the Great Barrier Reef . But a CSR expert believes a joint approach could balance the seemingly conflicting objectives . <p> The Palaszczuk government approved three mining leases to Carmichael coalmine in the Galilee basin , which is set to create thousands of jobs in the state and generate billion . <p> Despite the conditions that the government has said are in place to protect the reef , conservation groups have warned that the project will increase the risks to the world heritage-listed site , including climate change and pollution . <p> Jill Riseley , founder and managing director of Meliora Group , a strategic advisory firm specialising in corporate sustainability , said long-term strategy and collaboration is needed to ensure job creation while protecting the environment <p> " It 's sort of a battle of wills going on , whereas , at the end of the day , everyone would want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a systemic approach to investment , " Riseley said . <p> " I think there definitely is a way of balancing it , but I think it 's also a challenge of balancing long-term and short-term outcomes <p> " If you look at Queensland as a state , their main industries would be mining , tourism and agriculture . <p> " And when you look at the number of small businesses that are the lifeblood of the economy , that are absolutely linked to tourism , and absolutely linked to the Great Barrier Reef , there 's a real need at the moment to look at the systems in quite a holistic way . " <p> She said that the Queensland Government 's outlook was too short-sighted . <p> " Obviously the government 's decision was very much linked to the employment opportunities , " she said . <p> " But when you look at what the threats to the reef are -- climate change is number one , pollution , unsustainable fishing , industrialisation there does n't seem to be an appropriate balance of the short-term benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that government regulation was not enough to protect the reef . <p> She said that any group that impacts the reef , in either a positive or negative sense , needed to be involved in the process . <p> " Government needs to be involved , but I do n't think you ca n't regulate your way through everything , and I do n't think the government has the resources to regulate everything , " she said . <p> " Obviously they have checks and balances in place and environmental approval is one of them , but ... there really needs to be a trifecta collaboration going on . <p> " There 's huge numbers of people whose livelihoods depend on a thriving and prosperous reef , there 's government at a state and local and federal level , and then the huge number of conservation groups that do amazing job at protecting the reef . <p> " There needs to be a lot more collaboration and looking at , in the next 10 years , how we are going to ensure that the reef is protected and sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get is regulation , and regulation is a really blunt tool and often does n't work effectively . " <p> The approval for the country 's largest coalmine came as scientists said that the water quality targets set in the Reef 2050 plan , submitted to Unesco last year , were unlikely to be met . <p> Scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science said that agricultural run-offs were entering the reef 's waters , and that voluntary adoption of best practices was insufficient . <p> Riseley said that the industry needed greater resources in order to implement sustainable processes . <p> " To improve any sort of process from an agriculture perspective there are costs involved in doing that , and possibly the resources have n't been put there to ensure people are able to improve their practices so the water quality is the quality that it should be , " she said . <p> " How you do that is , again , working out what 's the best path forward , and ensuring that all parties are genuinely committed to deciding up to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Adani , and potential future projects , would face challenges in securing capital because of the growing sustainable investment consciousness . <p> " They 're looking at coal , and coal is n't nearly as attractive as it used to be as a project to invest in , " she said . <p> " And then it 's in a high-risk area if something goes wrong -- the reputational damage of impacting the reef . <p> " The coalmine in question is only 50 kilometers south from the Whitsundays and 19 kilometres from the nearest reef , and that 's a high-risk project for an investor . <p> " No one wants to be held responsible for damaging the reef , so it would be one of those projects that would be looked at with a fine-tooth comb from investors . " <p> She predicted that , regardless of government response , environmentally questionable projects would struggle to get off the ground in the future . <p> " I think what we 'll start to see in the future is that these projects are n't viable simply because people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in these projects anymore , and as a result the projects wo n't proceed , " she said . <p> " Not because there is n't government approval , not because you ca n't get the workforce , but actually because the investment environment and the investment criteria is at the moment rapidly changing . <p> " I know from an ESG environmental , social and governance investment perspective people would be treading very carefully before touching that project . " <h> Post Comment <h> 2 Comments <p> Seeing this trouble which could not manifest itself in a few minutes causes me great alarm . On a side note , how could our environment minister have been given ' that award ' as best minister when he has clearly misrepresented the health of our reef over the years . Shame ! <p> If only this could be front page news on all media to show the world what damage and how close this damage is to The Beautiful Barrier Reef ... Where are all the community leaders and elders fighting on this front . Thankyou <p> Birmingham was on 
 <p> Natalie Kyriacou has spent most of her life standing up for society 's voiceless members . The wildlife campaigner is this week 's Changemaker . <p> For Natalie Kyriacou , helping to protect at-risk wildlife around the world means she is spending as much time thinking about humans . <p> The wildlife warrior explains her work as ultimately " trying to forge new understandings of humanity 's relationship with nature " . <p> Last year she developed what she calls the first mobile application with a positive impact on real-life conversation . <p> After working with more than 10 different charities and being selected as one of the Foundation for Young Australian 's 2015 Social Pioneers , Kyriacou is showing no signs of wavering or slowing down . <p> Perhaps one of her proudest achievements was the role she played in getting Australia 's largest travel wholesaler , Tempo Holidays , to enforce a global ban on elephant rides . <p> As this week 's Changemaker she shares what a typical day for a young leader entails and explains what enables her to keep striving to make a difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Right at this very moment , I am in Sri Lanka with my organisation , My Green World , working alongside one of my partner charities , Dogstar Foundation . We are just about to undertake a huge street dog sterilisation campaign within the Negombo region . Sri Lanka is home to millions of roaming street dogs and cats , who suffer immeasurable pain from diseases , vehicle accidents , and cruelty . Overpopulation of street dogs ( and cats ) has been an issue that societies have dealt with in a variety of ways , many inhumane . The welfare of the animals has rarely been considered and , as a result , campaigns of poisoning , shooting , electrocution , drowning , starvation and other cruel methods have been used to " dispose " of unwanted animals . Such activities are not only brutal , they are ineffective because , although they may serve as methods for " immediate " results , they are not long-term solutions . <p> In Sri Lanka , the most effective way to deal with the street dog overpopulation crisis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working with Dogstar Foundation to transform animal welfare in Sri Lanka . Since 2006 Dogstar has worked closely with Sri Lankan communities and vets to provide sterilisations , vaccinations , veterinary treatment , education leading to attitude change and the development of veterinary practice . <p> Added to this , I am working on building and expanding My Green World . My Green World is a wildlife and environmental organisation that is dedicated to bridging the gap between the public and wildlife and environmental initiatives . It catalyses new leadership in wildlife and environmental conservation ; inspiring dialogue , education and collaborative problem solving via unique platforms . The foundation of the company is to develop innovative and educational platforms that will enhance the efforts of global wildlife and environmental conservation . Partnered with 18 international charities , My Green World is a platform for the public to learn and engage with various organisations that have a positive impact on the natural world . Through My Green World I have utilised online technology platforms to educate and mobilise the community to participate in wildlife , environmental , animal welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest current projects at My Green World is a mobile game app called World of the Wild ; the first mobile game app with a positive impact on real-life conservation and charity initiatives . In World of the Wild , every day people can participate in virtual wildlife conservation scenarios . The game represents 18 global charities and gamifies the concept of saving animals . Each action that users take in this app represents a real life scenario that is carried out by My Green World 's partner charities in real life . In this game , users can build their own wildlife sanctuary , and rescue , feed and provide medical care for a variety of animals , interact with other players , compete in educational pop quizzes , and meet some of the world 's most endangered species . <p> How long have you been working in the Not for Profit sector ? <p> I have been working in the sector for about eight years now . My Green World was founded with the aim of assisting Not for Profits around the world and creating a collaborative platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create unique and impactful ways to engage the broader community in important social issues . <p> What was your first job in the Not for Profit sector ? <p> My first job in the Not for Profits sector was with Dogstar Foundation . In 2008 I travelled from my hometown in Melbourne , to spend some time connecting with nature throughout Asia . My first stop was Sri Lanka , where I worked with abused elephants in a rural community near Kegalle . It was in Sri Lanka that I first lay witness to the huge animal overpopulation problem that the country was experiencing . I was astounded particularly by the street dog overpopulation problem ; at every street crossing , every corner , and outside every shop front was a roaming street dog . Most often , they were riddled with mange , a parasitic skin disease , and starved beyond belief . Thousands upon thousands of dogs and cats were in urgent need of medical attention , scattered across the worn streets of Sri Lanka , and nobody seemed to be helping them . Hidden within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came across a modest pamphlet which simply said : " Dogstar Foundation contact us if you have a dog in need . " I began enquiring after this mystery charity , and eventually was able to meet Samantha and Mark Green , the Founders of Dogstar Foundation . Soon afterward , I became heavily involved in Dogstar Foundation , which has expanded into a leading Sri Lankan charity that is transforming the lives of animals in Sri Lanka and providing education to communities throughout the region . To this day I continue working with Dogstar Foundation ; I sit on their board of directors , they are one of my My Green World 's partner charities , and I have also launched Dogstar Foundation " Down Under " in Australia . <p> What is the most rewarding part of your work ? <p> My Green World 's success has relied heavily on my being glued to my laptop , networking , building tech platforms and creating educational content . While I love doing this , the greatest part of my job is seeing the actual on-ground results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impacted by My Green World 's initiatives , and who feel empowered and inspired to make change . I love working with partner charities like Dogstar Foundation where we spend our days chasing down dogs , jumping fences , scaling walls , climbing through barbed wire , running along beaches and driving down tiny alleys in pursuit of dogs , before vaccinating them , micro-chipping them and spaying/neutering them . It is moments like that which make every failure , every sleepless night , every financial loss , and every bit of sleep deprivation seem completely inconsequential . <p> What has been the most challenging part of your work and how do you overcome that ? <p> My Green World represents one of the biggest challenges in my life , but it is also the most rewarding aspect of my life . I have poured my life-savings into this organisation and my mobile game app ; selling my car , hosting numerous fundraisers and working around the clock to ensure that the company is able to fulfil its charitable objectives . <p> The progression of My Green World has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each one is something that both myself and the company can grow and learn from . There are always major challenges to running a wildlife and education organisation ; lack of funding , feeling overwhelmed by the global atrocities that are occurring around the world , feeling insecure and being riddled with self-doubt ; but I have learnt to welcome these challenges and stay true to my beliefs . I remind myself why I started this enterprise , and that there are animals , environments and people around the world that need our help . I remind myself to remain confident and determined and to treat each challenge as an obstacle that I can learn from and feel proud of myself for overcoming . <p> In terms of your work sitting on a Not for Profit board , what would you say is the key to an effective NFP board ? <p> I think communication and transparency are key to an effective NFP board . A willingness to learn from mistakes , and to constantly strive to improve and adapt to changing landscapes . <p> What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The freedom to be creative and explore innovative and exciting new ways to solve global problems is one of my favourite things about running My Green World . The opportunities are limitless , and I am able to think outside the box and explore areas that I was never able to when I worked in the corporate sector . I love being able to wake up every morning bursting with energy and inspiration to create change and tackle issues that once seemed so impossible to solve . I love that through my company , I have been given the great privilege of being able to educate , inspire and collaborate with people from of all ages and from all walks of life . <p> I consider my greatest achievement to be ... <p> One of my greatest achievements would have to be my mobile game app called World of the Wild . Added to this , I was recently recognised as one of the Top 50 Leading Conservationists from around the world , in a new book called Saving Wild : Inspiration from 50 Leading Conservationists by Lori Robinson that ever has . " -- Margaret Mead <p> I 'm always being asked ... <p> " Why did you choose to help animals ? " The answer to that is far more complex . I do n't believe I am just helping animals . I believe that I am trying to forge new understandings of humanity 's relationship with nature . My aim is to empower young Australians and global communities to follow their dreams and realise the incredible power that they have to make positive changes in the world . <p> What are you to at the moment ? Why ? <p> I am re-reading The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf , a book that explores the relationship between beauty and female identity . I am a bit of a bookworm , but I particularly enjoy reading feminist literature , because , well , I am a feminist . I am also reading Rick Riordan 's Heroes of Olympus series , which is almost as good as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unashamed Harry Potter fan . My taste in books is quite diverse ! I just finished the Sixth Extinction : An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert , which I would highly recommend . <p> Through your work , what is your ultimate dream ? <p> I want to create a global ecosystem where people can connect with wildlife and environmental issues and initiatives , where they can learn , feel inspired and be encouraged to make change . I want to be a leading resource for individuals and charities around the world to feel empowered to take action . I want to provide our next generation with the tools to be able to ensure the survival of our planet and all of its species . But most of all , I want to be able to prevent our world 's wildlife and their habitats from suffering at the hands of humanity . <p> My greatest challenge is ... <p> Switching off and relaxing ! There is always work to be done and I find it difficult to find a good work/life balance . <p> School taught me ... <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always question everything , and always strive to expand your knowledge . School taught me the importance of education , and to this day , one of my primary objectives at My Green World is to both educate and inspire people from all over the world . <p> What does a typical day for you involve ? <p> There is rarely a typical day for me . I spend a lot of time travelling and am always getting involved in new causes and initiatives . Most recently I have started supporting Awareness Organisation in South Australia . <p> I suppose that a typical day in Melbourne would be to wake up , have a shower , coffee and breakfast , and then spend 30 minutes trying to retrieve my socks and personal items from my thieving dogs . After this , I set up with my laptop and go through emails , schedule my company 's social media posts and fiddle around on my website , updating content and improving SEO . <p> Then , I would normally have a meeting with either a fellow entrepreneur , my app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run a few errands . <p> After that , I would have some lunch , spend some time with my dogs , and then head over to a caf ? to do some more work ( I find that I work best in a bustling caf ? in the city ) . <p> In the afternoon , I usually spend time creating educational content , writing blogs , liaising with partner charities , and coming up with new material for my mobile app . <p> That being said , my days are really varied . This week , my schedule is a little different , and probably a little more exciting . My partner charity and I will be spending our days racing through the streets of Sri Lanka , catching roaming street dogs and cats , vaccinating them , micro-chipping them and then loading them into a mobile van to be spayed/neutered . We will then spend the evenings sitting by the beach talking strategy , opportunity and animal welfare ! <p> What ( or who ) inspires you ? <p> Working in my field , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds are not tipped in our favour . Wildlife extinction , habitat erosion , food insecurity , poverty , and animal abuses are gargantuan issues that sometimes seem too big to take on . But we can do it . For every one person that is acting illegally or unethically towards wildlife , there are thousands of people who are fighting against it . For every one person that is n't aware of the plight of our world 's wildlife , there are thousands of people trying to educate them . It is the individual acts of bravery that make a difference , along with the knowledge that such bravery is bringing our society together in a collaborative , compassionate space to make a difference . <p> Of course , I would never be where I am today without my mentors and inspiration , Samantha and Mark Green . Sam and Mark are the Founders of Dogstar Foundation in Sri Lanka , and while I know they would hate me to refer to them as " heroes " , that word certainly pops to mind when I think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2008 , they have been my friends , business partners , mentors and inspiration .

 Harmony in the Aftermath of Brussels <p> By Violet Roumeliotis , <p> In the aftermath of the senseless violence seen in Brussels , the Not for Profit sector has a big role to play in promoting meaningful social and economic participation through employment and humanitarian services , writes Violet Roumeliotis , CEO of Settlement Services International . <p> In Australia , Harmony Day is a celebration of cultural diversity that focuses on inclusiveness , respect and belonging . Recently , Settlement Services International marked the day with celebrations that also integrated Nowruz the New Year 's celebration for more than a dozen cultures globally . <p> These celebrations , however , took place against a tumultuous global backdrop , where just hours before news had broken of the devastating terrorist attacks in Brussels . <p> While the media primarily focused on the Belgian capital , we know similar attacks also occurred in Turkey and Mali in the days before . <p> The response to past terrorist attacks shows us these events can divide communities and lead to racist activity . Refugees and people seeking asylum are particularly vulnerable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences , however , we should mark these events by renewing our focus on inclusion , respect and racial tolerance . We should strive for social harmony and greater cohesion among all community members , including those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds . <p> A wonderful example of this was the I 'll Ride With You hashtag ( #IllRideWithYou ) that gained popularity following the 2014 Martin Place siege . Everyday Australians used the hashtag as a vehicle to show their support for Muslims in their local communities by offering to accompany their fellow commuters to help counter any anti-Muslim sentiment . <p> Many people are also pitching in to extend their support to some of the newest arrivals to the Australian community : Syrian and Iraqi refugees . We only have to look to Sydney 's northern beaches where dozens of congregations are working together to coordinate a warm welcome for Syrian refugees as they settle into their new communities . <p> At SSI , we 're involved in a number of initiatives that promote social cohesion and harmony for refugees and people seeking asylum , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a number of organisations that co-signed a letter urging the Baird government to get behind the council 's plans for a temporary accommodation centre for newly arrived refugees . <p> SSI is also working closely with restaurateurs and sisters , Carol and Sharon Salloum , who are using their connections in the hospitality industry to help newly arrived refugees find employment and integrate into their new communities . <p> The sense of belonging and inclusion that refugees receive from employment is just as important as the economic independence it offers . Finding work helps refugees to improve their language skills and develop new social connections , which ultimately helps them to settle successfully into their new communities . <p> Finding alternative employment pathways for refugees , migrants and people seeking asylum was one of the main drivers behind SSI 's recent partnership with insurer Allianz Australia , which will result in permanent roles for 20 people over the next two years . Allianz will also deliver educational scholarships to help refugees and people seeking asylum , in a similar manner to the educational scholarships that we offer through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure their meaningful social and economic participation by eliminating education as a barrier to settlement in Australia . Access to education ultimately increases social participation , independence , and economic and personal wellbeing for people from refugee backgrounds , leading to social cohesion in their new communities . <p> In a similar vein , SSI 's Ignite Small Business Start-ups initiative supports fledgling entrepreneurs from refugee backgrounds while they establish a small business or expand an existing one . Many refugees have a strong entrepreneurial spirit and , when supported to overcome settlement challenges , they will go on to contribute greatly to the Australian economy . <p> Reza , an Iranian refugee who SSI is working with , put it best when he recently explained to SSI staff why finding employment was at the top of his wishlist on arrival in Australia last year . <p> " Working here as a newcomer gives a person lots of opportunities , " said . <p> " You 're getting to know the people who live here , with whom you 're going to live and with whom you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're improving your language proficiency and then , above all , you are contributing to your new community besides making your own life . " <p> Organisations in the Not for Profit sector have a big role to play in promoting meaningful social and economic participation through employment and humanitarian services . <p> In the aftermath of the senseless violence like we saw in Brussels , it 's important that we remember why we 're engaged in initiatives that promote social harmony , and refocus our efforts on inclusion and respect for all . <p> About the author : Violet Roumeliotis is CEO of Settlement Services International and a member of Pro Bono Australia 's 2014 Impact 25 .

 in 2016 There 's Some Good News <p> By Abby Clemence , <p> Companies and brands who use charity sponsorships as a key tool in their promotional strategies are on the increase , writes sponsorship expert Abby Clemence . <p> I think it 's time we all had some good news . I recently read a report called What Sponsors Want and Where Dollars Will Go In 2016 from IEG as a result of a recent global survey they have undertaken with sponsorship decision makers , and I 'm glad to say that it 's good news for the for-purpose sector . <p> You can read the full reporthere , but there were a few overall key findings that I thought needed immediate mention . <p> The report reveals that marketers are becoming more confident in their spending as favourable economic conditions continue to prevail . Companies and brands who use sponsorship as a key tool in their promotional strategies are on the increase and that trend has been steadily growing since 2014 . <p> Sponsorship , far from being the smallest piece of the marketing budget pie , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advertising , marketing and promotion , and in North America ( where many of our trends in Australia flow on from ) sponsorship spend is set to outpace other forms of marketing spend . <p> Specifically for the for-purpose sector , marketing budget driven sponsorship is growing year on year but excitingly , the landscape of how causes are funded is becoming more fluid as more and more companies choose to combine programs with initiatives that also look at CSR and philanthropy as ways to engage with our sector . <p> A big growth area amongst the sponsorship decision makers who were surveyed ( and this correlates strongly with our own research ) was access to digital benefits , with 95 per cent of respondents saying that social media was extremely important to their outcomes . <p> The great news is that respondents also highly valued the benefits of public relations ( a sponsor leveraging your good name as a result of your relationship together ) , on-site interaction ( connecting with your community and audience face-to-face ) and internal communications ( leveraging your own marketing channels -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> One very interesting piece to come to light in the survey ( and a huge opportunity for our sector ) was the fact that the majority of sponsors are looking for assistance in measuring ROI because they are not doing a good job at evaluating the return on their own . Significantly more sponsors are seeing value in organisations and events that can provide reporting and tracking of the sponsorship 's effectiveness . <p> Interestingly , the report reveals that sponsors seem to be most interested in how their brand is perceived , and what the awareness levels are around their products and company than metrics around sales . <p> This is something that for-purpose organisations can easily do , and to be able to promote that during the initial relationship building phase would add potency to your approach . <p> Seven out of 10 sponsors said that they were in the market for new sponsorship relationships and for every a company spends on a sponsorship , they spend activating ( promoting ) that sponsorship to make it work for them . Do n't forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to value your sponsorship at . <p> A company will always have to factor in activation costs on top of what you charge them . Having said that , remember that to the right company , you are a valuable marketing partner in their brand story . <p> There is worth in " who you are and what you do " so do n't settle for peanuts . <p> About the author : Abby Clemence is the managing director of Infinity Sponsorship and founder of the world 's first online Sponsorship University for Not for Profits and charities .

 Break Cycle of Family Violence <p> A million federal government campaign designed to help break the cycle of violence against women and their children will begin on Sunday . <p> The campaign , it at the Start , targets the attitudes and behaviours that adults might dismiss or ignore in young people . <p> Screenshot of television campaign <p> Minister for Social Services Christian Porter said the campaign would help so-called " influencers " such as parents , family members , teachers , coaches , community leaders , employers and other role models become more aware of what they say and do . <p> " This three-year Council of Australian Governments initiative is jointly funded by the Australian , state and territory governments . It will build on efforts already underway by states and territories , as well as organisations like Our Watch and White Ribbon , " Porter said . <p> " This campaign represents a new and important approach . People know that violence against women is wrong ; what they may not know is that we -- all of us can unknowingly excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Our research shows that too often , adults believe that disrespectful or aggressive behaviour by young males towards young females is something that should be understood rather than judged and discouraged . <p> " Research shows adults often unwittingly excuse objectively unacceptable behaviour with notions such as ' boys will be boys ' . It is also clear from our research that too often adults blame the victim by asking what a victim may have done to invite what should simply be recognised as unacceptable , disrespectful behaviour . " <p> Minister for Women , Michaelia Cash said it was vital that as a society we address the attitudes that underpin , excuse and perpetuate violence against women . <p> " The national campaign will unite families and communities around young people to positively influence attitudes towards respectful relationships and gender equality , " Cash said . <p> " This campaign will help role models realise the impact of what they say and help them start conversations about respect with boys and girls . <p> Screenshot of television campaign <p> " From early on , adults are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between men and women .

 Young People Worsening <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Less than 0.1 per cent of rental properties are affordable for a single person on Newstart or Youth Allowance , Anglicare 's Rental Affordability Snapshot has revealed . <p> The welfare Not for Profit surveyed more than 75,000 houses across regional and urban Australia on the first weekend of April to assess their affordability and appropriateness for people on low incomes . <p> Anglicare Australia 's executive director Kasy Chambers said the rental market was unaffordable and the situation had worsened over the snapshot 's seven years . <p> " Single people are particularly hard hit . If you 're single on any of the government payments , or even on a minimum wage , there was very little that was affordable for you , " Chambers said . <p> " Out of over 75,000 places , if you 're a single on Youth Allowance there are only 21 affordable houses .

So even for the best-off household that we surveyed , which is a couple on the minimum wage with two children who would be getting family tax benefit and rental assistance , less than 9 per cent of the properties were available for them . " <p> She told Pro Bono Australia News with the upcoming budget and looming election , the organisation would attempt to put housing affordability front and centre of the political debate . <p> " We 're hoping that the release of this report will help us further this conversation ... nobody can say that this is n't reality , " she said . <p> " This is an election year , the major parties have both talked about negative gearing this year , it 's on their agenda , let 's keep it there , let 's explore what difference it would make if we changed these policies . <p> " There 's a lot of money sitting there through negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to for housing . <p> " We 'd certainly like to see the tax review . It 's been pulled back from , it 's been paired down . We would like to see that very much be put back on the table . <p> " We know that the vast majority of that benefit goes to people in very much the higher-income bracket , it is a borrowing from the public purse , it is a benefit that comes out from the general tax take , so it would be really good to see that re-paid into the public . " <p> She also said that pushing a discussion about benefits and the minimum wage would be a priority . <p> " We also need to consider adequate income , and both housing and adequate income are priorities for the budget and the election . If the minimum wage ca n't manage to get you an affordable place in the rental market , then clearly it 's not enough , " she said . <p> " Even more of a concern is government benefits , because ... clearly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to live then it 's not enough for you to find work , for you to be healthy , for you to continue your education . " <p> " Every level of government has an impact into the costs of housing , so we really do need to ask the question of what 's going to make housing affordable and then get everybody to the table to talk about it , rather than say what can the Commonwealth do and what can local government do .

 Definition of PBIs -- Risk or Opportunity ? <p> By Myles McGregor-Lowndes , <p> A move on the definition of Public Benefit Institutions ( PBI ) has consequences of both risk and opportunities and needs careful consideration , writes Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes from QUT Business School . <p> The charity regulator , the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) , has released an exposure draft of the Commissioner 's Interpretation Statement on public benevolent institutions ( PBIs ) . ACNC now determines PBI status for Commonwealth tax purposes which is a threshold for income tax deductibility and fringe benefits tax ( FBT ) exemptions . <p> For many organisations , having PBI status is the " holy grail " of taxation status . It opens the door to FBT salary packaging , gift deductions , grants from foundations and a slew of state tax exemptions and concessions . <p> Any movement in the definition may spell either financial risk or opportunity depending on which side of the definitional fence you fall . <p> For this reason , the ACNC 's draft Commissioner 's Interpretation Statement about PBIs should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ATO in its previous tax rulings said that : " A public benevolent institution is a Not for Profit institution organised for the direct relief of such poverty , sickness , suffering , distress , misfortune , disability , destitution , or helplessness as arouses compassion in the community . " <p> A further 15,000 words on 40 pages explains the case decisions and their application . But as the ACNC is now the definitional gatekeeper for the PBI definition , it is proposing its own statement about PBIs . It includes the 2014 Hunger Project case that gave the courts the chance to review the meaning of the phrase " public benevolent institution " and diminished the ATO 's " direct " relief requirement . The ATO will then retire its tax ruling . <p> The Hunger Project 's case judgment included the following explicit direction about how to assess an organisation 's " public benevolent institution " status , being : " When the question is whether a particular institution is a public benevolent institution , the answer depends on the common or ordinary understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be approached as a legal question to be dealt with by the mechanical application of past authority , irrespective of the present current understanding of the expression in the currently spoken English language . " <p> So how does the ACNC 's draft explanation measure up ? <p> The ACNC Commissioner 's draft Interpretation Statement of PBI 's comes in at under 5,000 words and just 16 pages . It is currently being scrutinised for any movement either side of the ATO 's definitional fence . <p> The Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies at QUT has gathered a panel to discuss these issues in front of a Brisbane audience with Murray Baird , assistant commissioner <p> The event will be held on 9.30 to 11.30am on Thursday 28 April in Brisbane .

 Time of Social Sector Change <p> By Dale Renner , <p> is upon the social sector but we ca n't just busy ourselves with NDIS readiness projects . The Not for Profit sector needs to wrestle with questions of identity to keep what 's important and be willing to change the rest , writes innovation consultant Dale Renner . <p> With the impending arrival of individualised funding ( consumer directed care ) in disability , aged care and mental health , social organisations are in the midst of reform and readiness projects to make the operational changes required . But in all the sound and fury of the busyness , issues of fear , change and identity are ever present . <p> Not for Profits have some reason to fear these changes . In the UK , which has implemented individualised funding , 78 per cent of aged care residential beds are now provided by the private sector , with 58 per cent of these run by large corporate providers ( Grant Thornton UK 2014 ) . <p> While there are some differences , this points to the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms winning business in social markets . And while there will be teething problems , with some people missing out during the changes , service users are clearly demanding the ability to make choices about their services . This demand will continue to drive change . <p> The identity inherent in the term " Not for Profit " is strong . Many providers are concerned about what will be lost with the move to social markets . The challenge for these organisations is : " How do we keep core elements of what it means to be a Not for Profit , while making the changes necessary to succeed in the new market-driven environment ? " <p> This process of maintaining the essence of an organisation or movement , while continuing to move forward , is not unique to the social sector . In a way , this is the constant struggle we see between progressives and conservatives . Progressives without conservatives would change too much , too fast . Conservatives without progressives would slow down positive change . <p> Organisations need to conserve some of the status quo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the changes , we can learn from the radical market changes in the print media . Change has been thrust upon them in the form of the internet , disrupting their business model , which was primarily based on selling advertising . <p> What is important to keep , and what to change in this situation ? While newspaper people might love the feeling of ink-stained fingers or the smell of the giant presses , fighting to keep presses going in the face of digital delivery does n't make much sense . Newspapers have been asking themselves : " What is the valuable essence of our organisation ? The things that must be preserved ? " . Fearless journalism , holding powerful people to account , raising the quality of debate these are the core functions that must be retained . The challenge is how to preserve what 's important while letting go of the rest and adapting to digital delivery . The irony is that print media are now experimenting with Not for Profit structures for online newspapers . <p> It 's the same challenge for Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask : " What is the core essence of our Not for Profit identity , that which is vital to preserve ? " Is it the fact that the organisation does n't make a profit , but makes a surplus instead ? Is the legal structure the essence , or is it just the format ? As an analogy when The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald moved from broadsheet to tabloid " compact " format , did it change their essence or just their format ? <p> Not for Profit organisations can undertake a documented , deliberate approach to assess the aspects of the business that are vital to keep , and the aspects than can be changed . <p> Keep : The important core that needs to be preserved is the identity , the culture , those intangible elements that capture " how we do things around here " . It 's the purpose and passion and magic that happens when people dedicated to a cause work together to make it happen . In a social market where firms compete for customers , this core identity should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unique approach and way of doing things that makes an organisation stand out from the rest . <p> The irony is that a move from block funding to social markets makes an organisation 's uniqueness and identity even more important . People want to buy from an organisation that specifically meets their needs , not a generic organisation that provides exactly what everyone else provides . <p> Social organisations will need to be very clear about values and how decisions are made . A written decision-making process can help when values come into conflict with each other . For example , the values of respect for the individual and commitment to quality may come into conflict with the commercial imperative to grow the organisation and generate an operating margin . <p> Change : If our social organisations fight to keep those identity and purpose elements , what elements of the organisation should they be prepared to change or lose ? Ethically , outcomes should matter more than our own identity as a Not for Profit . Anything that holds us back from achieving better outcomes that our customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , many organisations can afford to change their legal structure , or some of their services .

We may need to change our language from " client " to " customer " , or change delivery method to involve more efficient service delivery . And while many customers may choose to use skilled case managers to help them manage their services , other customers may wish to avoid using case managers . <p> Organisations need to know how much and what they can change before they can embrace a different identity .

 CEO Jeremy Tobias said there were signs of improvement in some key areas but there was still a long way to go . <p> " If this was a university exam it would still be a pass mark for the Not for Profit sector , " he told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " We can now see that while having a large budget does not in itself lead to innovation , those NFPs who are actively pursuing innovation score higher in the Index and are more likely to have increasing budgets . <p> " This indicates funding and grants are more likely to be awarded to more innovative NFPs , and is consistent with findings from other key studies that link innovation to growth .

That has been my guiding force : to say do n't give up , work hard and give it a go and things will happen . <p> Why did you chose to focus on ovarian cancer ? <p> It 's because of my mother I dedicate my work to my mother because one of my greatest griefs was losing my mother to stomach cancer . She had symptoms for about 12 months before she died and I just kick myself because we were n't more attuned to it . <p> She had such courage but she was really quite miserable in the last couple of months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at Ovarian Cancer Australia , and in everything I do here I think of my mother . I think other women should n't have to go through what they go through with ovarian cancer . So I 'm absolutely determined to make a big change to ovarian cancer . <p> Each year 1,480 women are diagnosed and the survival rate is abysmal at 43 per cent . I would like to see teal be the new pink , because teal is the international colour for ovarian cancer . I think of breast cancer and what fantastic inroads have been made to that disease in the last 10 years and it shows with determination and resources , what changes can be made . There 's a lot more awareness and survival rates are a lot better and I want that for ovarian cancer . <p> What are your current priorities at Ovarian Cancer Australia ? <p> Well there 's four main areas of focus . The first is in research , and Ovarian Cancer Australia has launched an action plan for medical research into ovarian cancer and that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It recommends that there be much more collaboration in the sector between research institutes and also overseas . It also points out the areas of high impact where philanthropy can put their dollars in for the best bang for their buck . Ovarian Cancer Australia enables high-impact research and we contribute to that . In the coming years we want to do a lot more enabling and finding venture capital to fund research into ovarian cancer . <p> We 're also into advocacy and some of that is in fact advocating for new and innovative drugs to become available here in Australia . There 's are a lot of what they call " targeted therapies " that are new in the US and the UK . We want them here in Australia because we now know that ovarian cancer is n't just one cancer , it 's actually got a whole lot of subtypes . So for many years we have treated ovarian cancer ... as one size fits all , it 's the same regime . Now we know that ovarian cancer is a lot of subtypes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a lot more drugs coming onto the marketplace overseas and we have to advocate for them here in Australia . And in fact just recently , Ovarian Cancer Australia was invited by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to be one of the first organisations to appear before them for a consumer hearing into a drug that they are considering listing for the PBS . <p> This particular drug ... you can get it in Australia , but at the moment it will cost you . It does n't save a woman 's life but it gives them seven months of quality of life . Seven months that they would n't have probably otherwise . There was a lady that I was talking with about a month ago who has three sons that are doing VCE this year . She said to me , Jane I would really love to see my children finish their VCE , but she said on the other side , I do n't want to laden them with worth of debt . So it 's a very tough thing , how much value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awareness and what 's really important to know about ovarian cancer is that it does have symptoms . There is no early detection test . About 50 per cent of Australians think that it can be detected by a pap smear and that 's absolutely not the case that is cervical cancer not ovarian cancer . It does have symptoms , but the symptoms are very generalised . There 's four common symptoms -- pelvic or abdominal pain , feeling full after you 've had a small meal , bloating of the stomach or feeling urgency when you need to go to the toilet . They are very generalised symptoms and they could be indicative of anything , but if you 've had those symptoms for four to six weeks than you need to go and see the doctor and have yourself checked out . There 's no easy way to detect ovarian cancer . Sometimes it 's only found once a woman is actually operated on . The other point about awareness is that 20 per cent of ovarian cancer is inherited . So it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a family history of cancer it is important to tell your GP so together you can assess your risk and take any action such as increased surveillance or surgery . <p> Most of our work is in the support of women and their families that have ovarian cancer . We provide a lot of information . We have a tele-support line that women can ring up and ask any sort of question or have a chat . We are also just about to launch an online forum for women so they can communicate with one another in a secure environment at any time of the day . We run lots of support groups for women and we have what we call a " resilience kit " for newly diagnosed women . It gives them all the information that they need to know about the disease . <p> What keeps you motivated when you 're faced with women who have ovarian cancer ? <p> I 'm inspired by women living with the disease . I am absolutely determined that we 've got to have a game changer for it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . At the moment there are two women that I 've had a lot to do with and they 're in their final stages , and I think that this ca n't happen to others , we 've got to do something , and I keep motivated in that way . It can be quite tear jerking and emotional but I just think of the women in the future , and if I can avoid more women getting this disease than I can feel like I 've contributed . <p> What are the challenges in leading your organisation ? <p> This organisation is n't large , we only have 14 staff here . The challenge for me is getting the reach , getting to the 5,000 women nationally that are experiencing ovarian cancer . So that 's a challenge to actually find them because there is no centralised system . We want to find them to be able to provide support and assistance to them . <p> What we 're trying to do is work smarter and look for innovations especially through technology . If we can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , that 's where we 're heading . So always finding a smarter way of doing things because we 've got limited resources . <p> I think that the challenge is staying on top of the professionalisation of Not for Profit organisations . As a small organisation it 's hard , and I think the competition and expectation of donors have increased . I think the challenges with limited resources is being able to stay on top of the game and being able to communicate your offer to your stakeholders . <p> Is there anything that frustrates you about the Not for Profit sector ? <p> I think that they 're probably too many Not for Profit organisations . I have been involved in , in my career , in two mergers of Not for Profits . I really like to encourage organisations to at least work collaboratively with one another and , if possible , to look at mergers because I think it 's a way to reducing cost and developing more specialisation for organisations . I think there are some really good reasons to consider a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing foundations or other NFP entities should be first considering if there is already in existence an organisation that they could work through . <p> Do you see yourself staying in the Not for Profit sector for the rest of your career ? <p> I did have a stint outside of the Not for Profit sector when I worked at KPMG , and that was very exciting . I authored their flagship publication , the Company Director 's Toolkit . That was exciting , but really my heart is in the NFP sector . I really love working with the value-based staff and volunteers . I continued to get inspired by the women in this organisation and what can be done because people are all behind the cause . So I do n't think I 'll be moving from the NFP sector again into commerce . In the NFP sector ... you have to run them organisations like businesses , so there are similarities there . <h> Lexus Design Awards 
 Taking Action in a Time of Change <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Giving young people a voice and ensuring that youth issues are on the agenda in the upcoming federal election are the current priorities for board chair Jon Brew , who features in this month 's Evolving Chair . <p> Jon Brew is chair of Youth Action , the peak body for youth organisations and young people in New South Wales . In his four years leading the board , Youth Action has undergone significant change . <p> In this month 's Evolving Chair he shares his story of navigating a cross-roads and implementing positive change to create a sustainable organisation that serves young people in NSW . <p> What is the board structure of Youth Action ? <p> The board is made up of nine directors , and they 're elected by the members . At each AGM any vacant positions are voted by the membership of the association . <p> What attracted you to the board ? <p> I 'd been working in the sector for 25 years . When I joined , the organisation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was aware that it was the peak body for youth services and young people , and I was always interested in the work they were doing . An opportunity came up and so I put myself forward for election and was voted in as chair . It was also an organisation that I saw was at a cross-roads , and I saw an opportunity for my knowledge and skills in regards to the sector to put into the organisation . <p> Can you explain the cross-roads you just mentioned ? <p> The youth sector , when I first started , was quite an ad hoc sector . Over the years it 's become more professionalised , and it 's quite a huge sector any organisation that works with young people , and that can include homelessness services to youth centres run by local councils . There 's 1.25 million young people in New South Wales and more research had been done into youth work as a profession , so over the years it had become more professionalised . And I felt that the peak body needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work had progressed into a more professionalised , more organised sector and the peak body that represented it needed to move along with it . <p> What are your board 's current priorities ? <p> In the last four years we 've gone through a lot of change . We embarked on structural changes to the organisation to make it more relevant but viable and sustainable . The organisation is in a healthy position , and part of those stages was the recruitment of our CEO . The strategic direction for the board is doing the work that we need to be doing . <p> We 've got four key areas that the organisation is concentrating on . The first one is amplifying the voice of young people through engaging young people into decision-making in the areas that affect their lives . Another one is equipping the youth sector to show their impact , and that 's providing support to the sector through collecting data , representation and engagement at a government level , and also their engagement in the community . <p> We 're also looking at , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform coming up in the sector , the government 's funding reform , so it 's supporting the sector through those reforms . At the federal elections we run election campaigns , and that 's highlighting the issues that are affecting young people and that are important to young people , to the candidates , and looking at making sure that youth issues are part of the federal election agenda . And the fourth one is being an accountable organisation and , in terms of governance , ensuring that we 're viable , that we 're representative of our members , and looking at ways we can better deliver the services , through collaborations and increasing our stakeholder engagement . <p> What is the biggest challenge your board has had to overcome ? <p> There have been many . We 've gone through a lot of change in the last three years . We went through a staff restructure in terms of being financially viable we needed to restructure the staffing . We went through a rebrand of the organisation , so we were called YAPA and we rebranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase brand awareness and increase our profile . We changed our website , we rebranded our logo . At a board level we went to a special general meeting and proposed to the members changes to the objectives and rules of the association . We changed our membership eligibility to expand the pool of our membership and to increase the expertise Youth Action could draw from . <p> We also changed the board composition . Previously the board was made up of representatives from the member organisations , so mainly representatives from the sector . But as a board we needed to attract the skills and expertise the legal , the financial , HR , marketing that we would n't necessarily be able to draw from our membership . So by changing our board composition we were able to strengthen the leadership capacity of the board , and to introduce members with acquired skill sets , and to ensure the proper governance of the organisation . At our special general meeting we put forward 31 changes to the constitution , which were voted through . There was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duration of the terms for the board members . So previously at each AGM all positions were up for vote , whereas we introduced one , two and three-year terms to ensure that board members could effectively contribute to the governance , but also to ensure sustainability of operations so that each year there was n't a changeover of new board members . Through those changes it 's provided stability to the organisation and a platform to then look at the recruitment of our CEO , and take a slightly backward step to allow the CEO to implement the strategies that we had set forward for the future . <p> How important is recruitment for a board ? <p> It 's important to attract people with legal and financial backgrounds . So our treasurer , for example , we were able to attract a financial accountant who could give us better scrutiny and oversight of our accounts , and to really sort the budgets out and our finances out so that we could get that platform to move forward , but also to create that sustainability and viability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job I 'm not an accountant , I do n't have that skill set and to have that specialist knowledge on the board really strengthens our ability to have good governance and to exercise our due diligence as a board . <p> And also having a legal representative on the board , being able to attract pro bono assistance , especially during the constitutional changes , they are skill sets we would n't necessarily be able to draw from in the sector . Now , in terms of people with government policy experience and marketing experience , we 've got a good balance on the board . We 've got a balance of people who have sector experience but we 've also got that balance of people with corporate and specialist expertise and knowledge . <p> What has been the highlight of your work with this board ? <p> Implementing change . We were able to initiate the changes required to move the organisation forward and to put us in a position where we were then able to go into the recruitment stage for the CEO attracting and recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and drive to move the organization forward . Those hard yards at the beginning and making the tough decisions at times -- it 's not a nice decision to make positions redundant but to make those hard decisions was the highlight because , as a peak body , we 're in a really good place in terms of our relationship with government and the relationship with our members . <p> What are the key sector issues that are being discussed at board level ? <p> We 've got a federal election coming up , so making sure that we present and represent young people to government and the different parties to put youth issues onto the agenda . Part of that is doing a national youth survey not for us to come up with the issues but so young people can come up with those issues , and then to strongly advocate to the politicians and parties so that youth issues are heard . <p> There is a major reform coming up for the majority of our organisational members , so ensuring that we represent our members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our members to governance for that reform is another key issue . At the moment we 've got 184 organisational members and there 's 520 individual members who we represent . <p> In terms of governance the priorities of the board are to ensure that we 're financially stable , and to support the CEO so she 's able to carry out the strategic directions that we set . <h> How to rank 
 Do n't Fund NDIS at the Cost of Safety Net <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> Disability advocacy group People with Disability Australia ( PWDA ) has strongly rejected the budget measures that link a fully funded National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) with the need to cut welfare spending . <p> " We have always welcomed a discussion about funding the NDIS so it is sustainable into the future and to ensure it is taken out of the budget cycle , " PWDA President Craig Wallace said . <p> " However , the NDIS Savings Fund announcement risks moving the NDIS further into the budget cycle by creating an expectation that the NDIS will be funded from ongoing trade-offs against other equally important human services expenditures . <p> " If there is to be a savings fund , it should not be a device to make savings , and poor trade-offs between programs and services supporting and sustaining vulnerable members of our community . " <p> As part of the budget announcements , Social Services Minister Christian Porter said the government would meet future NDIS costs through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savings Fund Special Account , once the fund was established . <p> " Savings in the NDIS Savings Fund will be quarantined , locking them in as protected forward contributions to the NDIS , " Porter said . <p> " This will help make up Labor 's billion shortfall in NDIS funding in 2019/20 , which increases to over billion per annum in the following years . <p> " Savings of $711.2 million over five years that were achieved through finalising transitional arrangements with states and territories , will also be set aside in the Savings Fund for reinvestment in the NDIS . " <p> He said the savings measures committed to the savings fund include : <p> Closing carbon tax compensation for new welfare recipients from 20 September 2016 at a saving of billion over five years . <p> Closing carbon tax compensation for those single income families not already in the welfare system but who will enter the welfare system from 1 July 2017 , with a saving of million over five years . <p> Additional reviews for Disability Support Pension recipients , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Greens spokesperson on Family and Community Services Senator Rachel Siewert said the government was once again going after the vulnerable to make savings whilst ignoring growing inequality . <p> " The budget is using the fully funded NDIS to take a swipe at income support recipients , including Newstart recipients and aged pensioners , after revealing plans to remove the energy supplement . It is also planning to drop more people off the Disability Support Pension , " Senator Siewert said . <p> " This is an unacceptable money grab by the government from people who are already living on or below the poverty line . We do n't need to hurt one vulnerable group to provide adequate services to another . <p> " I note that the government has still not moved to increase Newstart despite community service organisations , income support recipients , the Greens , business groups and major accounting company KPMG saying that the payment is way too low and is entrenching poverty . It must be increased . " <p> People with Disability Australia said the government has decided to subject another 30,000 Disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unclear how these people will be selected and where the employment opportunities will come from . <p> " In the absence of jobs , cutting people off the Disability Support Pension ( DSP ) and placing them on Newstart will leave some people with disability over per week worse off . This will leave people with disability at risk of spiralling into crisis and homelessness and in greater need of the kind of specialist disability supports the NDIS provides , " Craig Wallace said . <p> " We should not be making trade-offs and false economies between specialist disability support and income support . This is robbing Peter to pay Paul . <p> " While expressing concerns with several of the federal budget measures outlined by the treasurer , PWDA does welcome the decision to enable people with transport costs to retain their mobility allowance as the NDIS is rolled out in order to provide continuity of support . <p> " We are keen for further details about changes to eligibility requirements . A number of measures in this budget require further analysis and explanation . " <p> Calling an employee 
 ( CVA ) is preparing to take legal action against controversial fake cancer survivor and self-proclaimed fundraiser Belle Gibson over false cancer claims made in her top-selling book and for allegedly defrauding charities . <p> CVA said the move followed an in-depth investigation into alleged contraventions of Australian Consumer Law . <p> " The alleged contraventions relate to false claims by Ms Gibson and her company concerning her diagnosis with terminal brain cancer , her rejection of conventional cancer treatments in favour of natural remedies , and the donation of proceeds to various charities , " CVA said in a statement . <p> Consumer Affairs Victoria Director Simon Cohen has applied for leave to commence proceedings against Gibson 's company , Inkerman Road Nominees Pty Ltd ( in liquidation ) , in the Federal Court of Australia . CVA said leave was required because the company was in liquidation . <p> Cohen said the publishers of Gibson 's controversial book The Whole Pantry , Penguin Australia , <p> had agreed to an enforceable undertaking acknowledging that it had not required Gibson to substantiate her claims prior to the book 's publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Penguin will make a donation to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund , " Cohen said . <p> " Penguin must also enhance its compliance , education and training program with a specific focus on ensuring all claims about medical conditions are substantiated , and that statements about natural therapies are accompanied by a prominent warning notice . <p> " This is an important step in ensuring that consumers receive only verified information and are not deceived , particularly where serious matters of health and medical treatment are concerned . " <p> In March 2015 CVA said it was investigating the self proclaimed charity fundraiser who became a social media sensation through claims she was beating cancer and a range of other life-threatening illnesses through nutrition and holistic medicine.At the time the consumer watchdog said it was " making inquiries with Ms Gibson and her associated companies as to the nature of any fundraising appeals that may have occurred , including details of beneficiaries and net proceeds given " . In her book , Gibson wrote that " a large part of everything earned " is donated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs education programs in Sierra Leone , was promoted as one of the fundraiser 's beneficiaries but it said repeated attempts to contact The Whole Pantry about the promised donation more than a year after the event had been unsuccessful . <p> " In late 2013 The Whole Pantry advised One Girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event , " One Girl CEO , Chantelle Baxter said . " In early 2015 One Girl approached Belle Gibson from The Whole Pantry to enquire about when a donation would be made to One Girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event . " Baxter confirmed to Pro Bono Australia News that Gibson had donated following questions from Fairfax Media . <h> Assailant tries to 
 a CEO of a big organisation is hard slog , a lot of managerial detailed work that is n't the part of the job i 've ever liked . I 've liked the advocacy and the field engagement , and reminding Australians that we can make a difference , and rise above our stature of being just a middle power . <p> " I think as a sector it is a very unique time , under pressure , a great uncertainty and yet a growing sense of just the importance of who we are , and what this sector does for the good of the nation , so I did n't want to lose that and this role , and the very generous role of chief advocate for World Vision allows me to just to do the advocacy part . <p> " For me it feels good . It is more the fun not the slog , this is the stuff I do , so I 'm very excited about this . " <p> Costello is also the chair of the Community Council of Australia , the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The announcement was made on Monday by the chairman of World Vision Australia , George Savvides , who said Costello had made a unique and powerful contribution to World Vision in the 13 years he headed the organisation , as well as to the lives of many millions of people all over the world . <p> " Tim has brought extraordinary vision , compassion and a burning sense of justice to his role as CEO of World Vision Australia . He has been tireless in standing up for the world 's most vulnerable people and giving a voice to the voiceless , " Savvides said . <p> " When Tim took up the CEO role in 2004 World Vision had 480 projects benefiting 10.4 million people , a decade later this had grown exponentially with more than 800 World Vision development projects benefiting close to 100 million people across the globe including in Australia . <p> " Our transition plan means Tim can continue to serve World Vision under a new CEO , engaging international leaders , major corporate donors , and funding agencies as well as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue . <p> " I know the board joins me , as well as World Vision staff , volunteers and our many committed supporters around Australia , in thanking Tim for his exceptional commitment and the tremendous impact that his leadership has had on the people and communities with whom we work around the world . " <p> Costello , who has maintained a high profile as CEO of World Vision , Australia 's largest aid and development agency , since March 2004 , will remain as CEO until his successor commences . <p> The process of identifying suitable candidates is already underway with the international search firm Spencer Stuart appointed to conduct the recruitment . <p> Costello said it was a good opportunity for World Vision to look at generational change . <p> " I 'm 61 , I ca n't even believe myself that I am that old , but I am , " he said . <p> " You absolutely want the energy and drive and skillset , commercial and managerial , of someone to run this big ship , but I am absolutely passionate about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed , communities transformed , that brings tears to my eyes , and it 's not simply transactional -- shipping money for programs in and saying job done -- it 's actually transformational , it 's a relationship , it 's a journey , it 's mutual solidarity , and mystery of partnership and deep respect and that I am still very passionate about . <p> " I do think these roles now are very difficult for anyone to do what is essentially both managerial , chief salesperson , chief moral booster I think it 's very hard to do , plus three months travel a year . I think in this new role there will be opportunity to strengthen and specialise for greater impact , I think that 's what I would say to the next person , maybe unlike me do n't try and do it all . While it has been fantastic it is often very overwhelming . " <h> Wedding Fitness Plan 
 Helping Older Women at Risk of Poverty <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> A public policy think tank has teamed up with women over 50 to codesign a support program that will help older women achieve greater financial security through micro-enterprises . <p> The new initiative , Money For Jam , by Per Capita 's Centre for Applied Policy in Positive Ageing ( CAPPA ) aims to reduce the risk of permanent income poverty for women in their late 60s and beyond , by working with the women one-on-one to get to the root of their strengths and limitations . <p> It comes in response to what CAPPA calls a " hidden epidemic " that one in three Australian women over 60 are living in permanent income poverty and follows what it describes as " months of conversations " with women who are living off government support . <p> CAPPA 's director , Katelijne Lenaerts , said the exposure to income poverty of women in later life was enormous . <p> " One of the amazing findings is that the potential scale of the issue is much much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " These women are not losers -- many have a good education and professional careers , and they are not necessarily from a low socio-economic background . <p> " All it takes to go from middle class comfort to homelessness is a combination of a series of unlucky events such as an accident , deteriorating health , a difficult divorce , domestic violence or bullying . <p> " Loss of self-confidence often blocks the pathway out of despair , and having to rely on government support and crisis accommodation contributes to feelings of shame and guilt . " <p> The Money for Jam program follows months of in-depth conversations with 13 different women to gain an understanding of their life stories , current circumstances , needs and barriers . <p> The study found current mainstream support services did not take into consideration the reality of women 's commitments and constraints , including carer responsibilities and mental and physical health concerns . <p> " We do n't come up with a program and ask women if they will use it , we basically start off with understanding women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on in their lives and then out of that , we analyse it , to think about what would be a good outcome for those women , " Lenaerts said . <p> " These women do n't want the IKEA version of a business start-up a DIY kit of business planning templates or a loan that relies on an asset test . They do n't want to go it alone and often ca n't dedicate 80 hours a week to this . The ' full time or nothing ' approach offered by available services is not suitable to them . <p> " On a positive note , we were amazed at the resilience and resourcefulness of the women in their journeys through hardship and could not help but wonder how this can be better harnessed for income generation . " <p> Money For Jam 's approach uses these strengths , as a tool to support micro-enterprise start-up . <p> The program delivers emotional well being strengthening as well as personalised one-on-one practical support for micro-enterprise start-up , the use of adaptive language and an approach of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on a principle that emotional well being has to be strengthened first , before you can start talking about financial well being . Although this program is all about helping women with earning income , what we discovered is their self-confidence had been knocked down , so that needs to be strengthened first , " Lenaerts said . <p> " The first element is a well being boost , that is followed by a component where they sit down with a person one-on-one , they have a conversation with the women and they understand their life story , their strengths and also their barriers . That is really important , that the program is built around what their capacity and their limitations are . <p> " The next stage they go into a one-on-one facilitation session where somebody will walk alongside them , to go through some micro enterprise ideas and their practicality is tried out . That is what it is all about , they try out a number of ideas , they could be really simply like dog walking for a fee or English language tutoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , their passions and their strengths . <p> " Their mentor walks alongside them to get those enterprise ideas going until they find traction and then they are on their own . " <p> CAPPA said it is now ready to pilot Money For Jam and is seeking collaborators to support the program . <h> Chemicals Ltd 
 is to create a new set of emoji that represents a wide range of professions for women and men with a goal of highlighting the diversity of women 's careers and empowering girls everywhere , " the proposal said . <p> " The global women 's equality movement is growing , so the time to create these emoji is now . " <p> It follows an opinion article by Amy Butcher , Emoji Feminism , published in March in The New York Times , that reflects on the current state of female emoji . <p> She wrote : " Where , I wanted to know , was the fierce professor working her way to tenure ? Where was the lawyer ? The accountant ? The surgeon ? How was there space for both a bento box and a single fried coconut shrimp , and yet women were restricted to a smattering of tired , beauty-centric roles ? This was not a problem for our male emoji brethren . Men were serving on the police force , working construction and being Santa . Meanwhile , on our phones , it was Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the checks . " <p> The team at Google said they believed they could have a larger positive impact by adding 13 new emoji that depict women across a representative sample of professions . <p> The new emoji would cover business , health , science , education , technology , industry , farming , food service and music . <p> " For millions of people around the world , emoji are an important means of communication and a strong representation of culture . Yet the roles of people in the workplace can not be communicated with emoji . This is especially true for women , " the proposal said . <p> " All around the world , gender inequity is a focus . No matter where you look , women are gaining visibility and recognition as never before . Is n't it time that emoji also reflect the reality that women play a key role in every walk of life and in every profession ? <p> " Given the fact that women are the most frequent emoji users , and that they span a wide professional spectrum not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address this pressing matter of equality . " <p> Dr Caroline Lambert , CEO of YWCA Australia said she was delighted with the proposal . <p> " We 're delighted to see Google having expanded their emoji collection to reflect the true reality of women 's lives across Australia , " Lambert told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " The way we visually represent the work that women do , or do n't -- as the case has been with the emojis that we have had access to fundamentally informs the way we think about what women and men are capable of , and it reinforces harmful stereotypes that are based really back in the 1930s . <p> " I think we need to see emojis being far more women friendly , and far more diversity friendly generally . They absolutely represent the dominant power group in our society , so whether you are a woman , whether you are a person of colour , whether or not your are a person with a disability , emojis kind of speak to the white male , able-bodied experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population but the dominant group in terms of political power , economic power and voice .

 Call on Parties to ' Stop War on Women ' <p> A group of 10 women-focused Not for Profits have joined forces to demand that both major political parties place women at the " centre of the economy " as part of their federal election platform . <p> Led by the National Foundation for Australian Women ( NFAW ) , the coalition of organisations said the 2016/17 budget unfairly disadvantaged women , and the election was a chance to reverse damaging cuts . <p> " Even if they do n't start out as meaning to attack women ... they do n't do a proper analysis of how things are going to impact on women differentially , " social policy committee chair Marie Coleman said . <p> " Women will come out of this budget much worse than men . That 's why the parties have to do something about . <p> " We do n't know at this stage what the view of the opposition is on those budget savings , whether if they were elected they would keep them . <p> " We want both the government and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings . " <p> The group of organisations made 50 recommendations across a range of policy areas , including workplace relations , health , education , housing , domestic violence , taxation and superannuation . <p> " We are particularly concerned that there is nothing in this budget which represents a serious commitment to helping women get back into the workforce or to train for the workforce , " Coleman said . <p> " Adding to that is the impact of cuts for women escaping domestic violence , needing legal help . There is nothing to make housing more affordable . There are a whole lot of issues here which are very serious for Australian women . " <p> She said the NFAW would remain impartial during the election campaign , and would focus on educating women about their voting options . <p> " We do n't fight in the election campaign ... we make the bullets for other people to fire , " she told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " What will do next is prepare a summary of election policies on major issues of concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aimed at encouraging women to understand the voting system , make sure they register to vote and make sure that they know how to vote formally . <p> " When we do our election policies analysis it wo n't endorse any parties or any policies , it will set out comparing like with like ... summarising all of the party policies to make it easier to asses what the parties are promising . " <p> The coalition also includes WIRE , Green Union of Australian Women , Australian Centre for Leadership for Women , Council for the Single Mother and her Child , International Women 's Development Agency , Women in Adult and Vocational Education , Business and Professional Women Australia , Women 's Electoral Lobby , and Victorian Immigrant and Refugee Women 's Coalition . <p> No business is 
 Australians Learn Signs of Partner Violence <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Geelong AFL player Jimmy Bartel has joined forces with 1800RESPECT and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty to launch a new national campaign to help Australians recognise the signs of intimate partner violence and how best to support someone experiencing it . <p> The Support a Friend campaign , launched on Monday , features a video and information resources offering a practical list of do 's and don'ts for family and friends about how to talk to and safely support someone who may be experiencing domestic violence , including sexual assault . <p> According to government funded NFP the Australian National Research Organisation for Women 's Safety or ANROWS , one in four women in Australia has experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner . <p> Bartel , whose personal experiences with domestic violence as a child led him to pledge to grow awareness of domestic violence and how people can seek assistance , encouraged people to seek help . <p> " It is important for the people affected by domestic violence to reassure themselves they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their story is valued and not judged , " Bartel said . <p> " I ca n't encourage people enough who find themselves in domestic violence environments to have a conversation with family and close friends that they can trust and who can listen and not feel like they need to battle it alone . " <p> Australian of the Year 2015 , Rosie Batty said Support a Friend provided valuable information and advice on how to have the sometimes challenging or difficult conversation with someone experiencing the impacts of violence . <p> " I believe the most crucial support a family member or friend can lend is to listen without judging , " Batty said . <p> " Focus on what you can do to support her without telling her what to do . And it 's important that she feels you believe her , and that you want to help her . Blaming her , or suggesting it 's her fault or she should just leave , is not helpful . Respect her decisions even if you do n't agree . " <p> Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she seems afraid of her partner or is very anxious to please them , if she often talks about her partner being jealous or bad tempered , if she seems anxious or no longer trusts her own judgement , if she sees less of her friends or family or if she seems reluctant to leave her children with her partner . <p> Jane French from 1800RESPECT , the National Sexual Assault Domestic Family Violence Counselling Service , said it was important for everyone to recognise the signs . <p> " Given the impact sexual assault and domestic violence has across every section of our community , it is important for all of us to recognise the signs of violence in others and know what to do to support those women experiencing it , " French said . <p> " Many Australians learn CPR because one day someone 's life may depend on it . We should have the same mindset when it comes to educating ourselves about domestic violence because one day the wellbeing , or even the life , of a woman you know may depend on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , listen to her , take her concerns seriously and help her to explore options. ? <p> " You do n't need to have all the answers . Just let her know you are there for her . " <p> " People are often scared to ask questions about family violence because it 's still seen as such a personal issue , " Maguire said . <p> " This campaign helps all Australians to remember that the best thing we can do to support a friend or family member who is experiencing violence is just to let them know that we 've noticed and that we 're there to support them , whatever they need and whenever they need it . <p> " There 's a fear that people will make a mistake that they 'll say the wrong thing or they 'll assume that violence is occurring when there 's actually something else going on . But we know our friends and family and we know when there 's something just not right .

 New Economy Do We Want From the Next Government ? <p> Australian politics must respond to current pressures with collaboration and creativity , rather than pitting economics against society , writes Bronwen Morgan , Professor of Law at UNSW Australia . <p> A federal election approaches and , with it , a window of opportunity for big-picture conversations about potential future directions for Australia as a polity , a physical place , a society , an economy . <p> As Dennis Glover has argued passionately in his recent book , and Eva Cox has echoed in The Good Society Policy Network , " an economy is not a society " . And picking up on the currently pervasive meme of innovation , it seems timely to ask collectively , what kind of " new " economy do we actually want to create ? <p> The recent story covered by Pro Bono Australia News about the demise , for now , of equity-based crowdfunding legislative reform is telling . The legislation was criticised as failing to help small cooperative and social enterprise businesses . This theme is worth expanding further : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current pressures on our economy and natural resources with a positive vision of a more socially and ecologically responsive economy built from the ground up , linking multiple small-scale initiatives across many different sectors . This would create more room for collaboration and creativity , rather than a zero-sum game that pits " state " against " market " and lines them up against implicit images of restrictive state regulation and economic growth . <p> While the committee report gives examples of planting trees and removing pest plants as environmental remediation , it also speaks more generally of " practical action to both improve skills and outcomes for biodiversity and natural resource management " ( p. 34 ) . The " practical action " of " environmental remediation " could range much more widely than planting trees , to encompass a range of experiments to create a new economy around innovations such as peer-to-peer initiatives , commoning , maker movements , sharing , collaborative economies , solidarity economies , localisation and cooperative movements . Such creativity has the potential to weave social and ecological values into the heart of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside out " in short , environmental remediation . <p> Around examples such as these can be crafted a larger story , or at least a big-picture debate , in which citizens across the board can engage . Here 's a starter proposition . Today 's economy is built on the foundations of a global industrial and financial system with immense productive capacity , but the extractive nature of which has created extreme income disparity and social injustice and wrought devastation on the natural world . What are different generative visions of the " new economy " and how achievable are they ? More specifically , how can we reimagine work , exchange , money , care , law and our relationship with the natural world through the prism of a new economy ? <p> These questions catalyse the kind of conversation that will feed an appetite for systemic reform , and provide an anchor or a rudder for detailed debates about legislative technicalities in areas such as crowd-sourced equity funding orsocial enterprise legal models . They will help fuel a debate about the merits of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic system in a fundamental way , focusing it more on " people and planet " than on economic growth , linking systemic economic change to democratic empowerment , grassroots struggle and the pursuit of environmental and social justice . <p> Of course , another , perhaps more familiar , understanding of " new economy " is equally important : a technology-led vision , increasingly centred on digital disruptors , such as peer-to-peer services like AirBnB and Uber . While this vision usually linked to intensified competitive dynamics and global mobility , there are fascinating possibilities emerging at the intersection of these two visions , each of which has a long history . What would be really exciting would be to draw on elements of both visions to imagine novel and inspiring ways of designing social , democratic , political and ecological values into the heart of technological platforms . <p> This is about much more than current debates on both the ethics and the regulatory dimensions of the so-called sharing economy , important as these are . It is also about small-scale , community-embedded sustainable economy initiatives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be captured by a " tale of three conferences " . Championing ecological vision , social purpose and the promise of technology respectively , these three recent gatherings each contribute an important parameter of the debate that is needed . <p> Taking place within less than six weeks of each other , the first was the meeting Local Lives , Global Matters , in Castlemaine , regional Victoria in late October 2015 . Suffused with a commitment to the ecological health of people and planet , its vision of the future was embodied in localised economies , a challenge to traditional assumptions about the centrality of economic growth , and a critique of global trends in trade and investment . <p> The second conference , Purpose 2015 , was held in Sydney in early November 2015 , focusing on stories of purpose-driven business , meaningful work and values-based leadership , from social enterprise to benefit corporations . <p> The third , Platform Cooperativism , was described by its organisers as a " coming out party for the cooperative internet " , and championed the importance of shared ownership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who provide and use the services and experiences mediated by internet platforms should collectively own and control the platforms themselves . This conference took place in New York buttwo shorter , local events featuring the original New York organiser Nathan Schneider will be held in Melbourne in late June 2016 , under the title How to Make the Uber Economy Work for People and Building the Commons Economy . These titles together interestingly capture the tension embedded in competing versions of the " new " economy . <p> Platform Cooperativism spoke very little about environment , ecology or sustainable development . Local Lives , Global Matters had only one session that mentioned the internet and digital technology . Purpose 2015 , with its emphasis on social outcomes more than processes , sidestepped questions of economic democracy and shared ownership . Each conference , though , was abuzz with the energy , vision and excitement of several hundred people . Indeed , the kind of conversation we are advocating for around a new economy is happening all over the world , as this highly energising and interactive map fromThe Real Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in the context of an election where , as David argued , voters are genuinely interested in change , to explore these issues in more detail in the Australian context . A conferencewill be held at Glebe Town Hall in Sydney on 16 and 17 August 2016 , co-hosted by UNSW Australia and Australian Earth Laws Alliance that will contribute to this . The conference will include a plenary session on The City as Commons , exploring how different projects and ideas intersect with each other , and a second plenary exploring the idea of an Australian New Economy Coalition , whether for political advocacy , policy development or networking purposes . Whether at this conference , or in other settings , there is certainly the potential to fuse elements of this palpable appetite for change , coming from multiple perspectives , into a vigorous and stimulating brew that re-energises our coming democratic choices . <p> About the author : Bronwen Morgan is a Professor of Law at UNSW Australia and has been conducting a Future Fellowship Research Project funded by the Australian Research Council on the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and the UK. <h> How these 3 
 of Business <p> Despite the growing good intentions of the corporate sector , many businesses need guidance of a " third-space " organisation , writes Ellie Cooper in this month 's Executive Insight . <p> Formerly known as Change Labs , Karrikins Group is a global consulting firm , or third-space organisation , that works with businesses to increase their social impact through a strategic approach . <p> Earlier this year , Jason Hincks , former head of FoodBank Australia , became the CEO of Karrikins with a view to using his Not for Profit experience to grow community investment from the corporate sector . <p> " As we move forward from the era of ' chairman 's choice ' and disjointed corporate community investment , it is critical for charities and programs to align more closely with their partners ' strategic objectives " , Hincks told Pro Bono Australia News at the time . <p> " Equally , it is important for corporates to understand and articulate these objectives in a way that will resonate with their customers , stakeholders and shareholders . " <p> Dom Thurbon : Karrikins Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy and execution in businesses ' community investment . Our vehicle for change is to try to ensure that every dollar spent on community investment by large corporations goes to evidence-based , impact-focused , well-designed change programs , and begin to move the conversation away from more generic , feel-good , chairman 's choice-style partnerships where a lot of legacy spend still exists . The primary vector for our social impact is trying to harness corporate spend and direct it towards shared value activities that both create social value for communities , but also business value for the organisations that sponsor them . <p> We work in a few different ways , the focus of our programs is generally on behaviour-change programs , so we have a strong focus on face-to-face change programs that work especially with young people and education . So we 'd work directly with almost one million kids a year as young as five and well into their 20s in areas like financial education , cyber safety , digital literacy , health and wellness , disability and inclusion , across Australia , New Zealand and North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy and attention to create experiences that change behaviour . <p> How does Karrikins work with other companies to enhance their impact ? <p> Jason Hincks : We work with companies in two key ways . The first one is as a consulting business . We work with organisations to achieve the outcomes that Dom spoke about , so with their social investment and community investment strategies , so how do they achieve social impact , and how do they create business value along the way , and that really has been the most evolving part of our business . There really is lots of evolving thinking in that space , more so from the client side . We often talk internally about when we talk about the shared value concept that it 's something that Karrikins Group has been doing for years , it 's just now got a name , so consulting is our first piece that we work in . The second piece is in programs , large scale education programs with a focus on behaviour change . <p> How is this impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . For us , measurement falls into three steps . Firstly we think most organisations we look at actually fall at the very first step of measuring , which is figuring out what they want to measure , and so we have a firm belief that measurement and all social impact programs need to start with a construction of a logic model that clearly identifies their belief and assumptions about the causal change that they 're trying to affect , and really answer the question , how do we think this program or this activity makes change happen . <p> In the second step what looks like the impact of measuring we design bespoke , fit-for-purpose , mixed-method measurement practices . So we use blends of quantitative and qualitative tools to try to assess the type of short , intermediate and long-term changes that programs are having , and link the variables we look at back to the logic model . That 's a dense way of saying , every program has to be different in the way it measures impact , but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what change are we trying to create ? <p> And then the third part of measurement is to not forget , for businesses in particular , especially for companies that are looking to try to get more sophisticated in their approach to community and social investment , is to try to understand how they think these programs are going to create impact back on their business . We look at the four buckets of brand , customer , stakeholder and staff , and ask , how can a community program like the one we 're doing impact those four parts of the business , and what are the things in there that we 're going to measure . And again , the actual methodology for this has to be bespoke designed , based on the answer to that question . <p> Those are the three ways we try to understand impact , the first two are about social impact and the third one is about business impact on the programs that are being run . <p> What are the challenges in this line of work ? <p> Hincks : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really early on in their journey . One of the first things that we need to understand when working with a client is how far along they are in that journey understanding what their current methods are and , at the same time , understanding their appetite for a more contemporary approach to the space . <p> Quite often the challenges in those organisations are their current practices . It 's quite common in the space in Australia for a chairman 's choice and for very subjective views of social impact to be driving strategy . What we 're looking to do is ... take them through the various methods they can apply , and then almost at the same time looking at implementation and reporting . <p> So the key challenge is understanding where they are in that journey , and then understanding what the appropriate measures are to get them to a point where they really are achieving shared value . <p> : I agree that the biggest challenge is the fact that many , many businesses are still rooted in legacy approaches to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to is just so broad you 've got your super integrated , super strategic AIAs of the world , and at the other end you 've got organisations spending , in some cases , hundreds of millions of dollars in ways where there 's effectively no discernable strategy underpinning it . And that 's a huge challenge to try to help businesses evolve the way they think about it , especially business leaders , not just the CR corporate responsibility professionals . <p> How can businesses increase their impact ? What opportunities are available ? <p> : The one thing that always springs out in my mind as the great untapped potential is to bring a more sophisticated approach to partnership . Not for Profits do amazing work , but I think the real opportunity lies in businesses and Not for Profits developing a more sophisticated and evolved approach to partnership . Make it less like businesses effectively treating Not for Profits like suppliers of community services and having this really transactional we buy your logo with a donation and we buy your community impact with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about genuine strategic partners , coming together to say how can we do something that addresses a social issue while returning value to the business . In particular , the path to doing that is for businesses to look at third-space organisations like Karrikins Group . And this , I think , is the value we bring to the organisation . We are a for-profit business but we are also a for-purpose business , and we believe in the fusion between the private sector and the community sector , and our greatest strength is architecting partnerships that are evolved and strategic , that help people accomplish things they did n't think were possible . <p> That 's where the magic is going to be , for businesses to evolve their approach to partnership and think of it more as genuine partnerships , rather than , oh yeah you 're our suppliers in our giving program , you 're the charity we give money to . That 's going to be the space where lots of mileage can be made . <p> Hincks : What 's really created that opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ' objectives -- objectives as customer-based brands for example and the social intent of organisations . I think historically organisations have had to sort of buy their social licence to operate or demonstrate their social intent by partnerships with Not for Profits , and that 's been fantastic and there 's been some incredible work that 's been done through those partnerships . <p> I think now though the consumers of those organisations are digging a little deeper . The average consumer is a lot better educated , and their expectations that the organisations that they deal with , regardless of what level , are that they are going to be behaving in a way that 's consistent with their own values . So in the past where it was enough to be able to say we support this charity therefore we 're demonstrating our social intent , I think that consumers now want that but they also want to make sure organisations are both behaving in a way that 's aligned with their values and also having an authentic and significant impact on society as a whole @ <h> Tall Blacks named 
 Generation of Innovators <p> Julian Lee wants to help foster the next generation of scientists by making technology exciting for children , writes Ellie Cooper in this week 's Spotlight on Social Enterprise . <p> An HSC-level maths and science tutor , Julian Lee , founded social enterprise , which centres on the Little Makers Club , a technology program for primary school children . <p> He was inspired by his children , and their friends and cousins , who were playing with littleBits -- colour coded electronic pieces created in the United States that provide a hands-on experience in a fun and safe environment . <p> " I saw all these different age groups all working together and really engaged around electronics , " Lee said . <p> " I thought , wow ... I could take the things that I 've learnt for high school and take it back to primary school to try to address some of the challenges that happen as children grow up and lose interest in science and technology . " <p> The need to increase engagement in STEM ( science , technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lee said , from his personal experience , he could see a great need to target younger children . <p> " By the time children reach high school a lot of students have lost interest in science and technology , " he said . <p> " I think all subject areas are fascinating , but to have people think science and technology are boring is a big shame for Australia . In terms of staying innovative on the global stage , we need our best and brightest being interested in science and technology . " <p> He also wants to see greater female representation in STEM-related industries by providing them with a meaningful experience at a young age . <p> " Boys become more interested in science and technology-related subjects than girls do , which of course relates to profession choices as men and women , " he said . <p> " Everything we use now has some digital component . Having two daughters myself , I think it 's really important that girls have a really strong and interesting start in science and technology from an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what I 've sort of seen as unfair reasons they decide they do n't like it . <p> " We all probably think back to our schooling days and remember one or two teachers that we really liked , or subjects that we really liked , and that probably made a big difference to the choices we made in life . <p> " Little Makers is about making sure that there 's a really positive and fun learning experience around science and technology . " <p> Lee launched Little Makers in Sydney this year . But to get it off the ground he needed significant startup capital to purchase a set of littleBits a crucial component that would make it possible for primary school children to use electronics safely . <p> He applied for and received an ING Direct Dreamstarter grant to cover the initial cost . <p> " Two things then happened at once , ING supported the purchase of a classroom-sized kit their support was critical and at the same time I managed to get a school Newton Public School on board to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of this year . That then made ING 's investment more than a stab in the dark , " he said . <p> Lee is currently delivering a 10-week course to students in years one through six . Already 400 students have completed or are currently completing the program , and he will work with a further 400 over the course of the year . <p> " Over the 10 weeks we introduce them to the different types of electronic pieces -- inputs , outputs , power , wires , " he said . <p> " They learn about all the variations and we move up to doing projects where they actually build things based on circuit diagrams . <p> " Using the littleBits , because they 're magnetic , there 's no soldering required , you ca n't put them together in the wrong way , or in a dangerous way , and so they can experiment as much as they like to create their project . There 's a lot of chance to take advantage of children 's natural creativity and experimentation . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smaller projects , building sound-activated torches , music synthesisers or " mars rovers " . <p> " Then in the third part of the program they have a chance to work on a single project for two or three weeks where they can really develop it into something more than can be done in a 50-minute period , " Lee said . <p> " All those stages build different skills that are essential for later in life . Although it is about electronics , it 's also about teamwork , it 's about experimentation , prediction , project work . <p> " It 's also got a lot of arts and craft design components in it because we 've got electronics all around us , but those electronics are inside housing , inside design . <p> " It 's the cardboard and all the materials they make to put their electronics inside that really determines what makes each of their projects different from each other . And one of the comments I 've had from the children is , wow , electronics are n't that complicated . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes it interesting and different . " <p> Along with the popular 10-week program , Lee is looking to deliver a range of other Little Makers courses in school , after school and during holidays . <p> " I 'm trying to make it as flexible as possible . Some kids who love electronics might like to have an electronics workshop at their party , or on school holidays I 'll run a half day or one day course at the neighbourhood centre , " he said . <p> The business model is a straightforward sales model -- participating schools pay for the course , which covers 100 per cent of the operating costs . <p> " This is a pretty straightforward business model , so what makes it a social enterprise is the particular focus on children , girls in particular , and also a 25 per cent discount to public schools , " Lee said . <p> " And what I 'm in the middle of doing is applying for a grant to be able to take this out to regional and rural Australia where I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people in the city get . " <p> Lee said the biggest challenge he faces is scaling the Little Makers program . <p> " I was very fortunate in getting both ING and Newtown Public School on board early . That has provided me with a year 's worth of friendly development and startup , because it allows me to prove myself and say , well I 've delivered to years one to six , " he said . <p> " But what will be really challenging is then taking that to the next stage . Can I get other schools on board ? Can I get after-school programs ? The market is pretty tight and competitive , so that will be the biggest challenge . " <p> He said his main goal is to deliver the program to children who are most at risk of becoming disengaged with science due to a lack of teaching resources . <p> " The focus for me is really on getting public schools on board because a lot of these things can be prohibitive to public schools , and I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available to private schools is just incredible . And regional and rural Australia for similar reasons , " he said . <p> " And also for girls having girls stay excited and have a positive experience around science and technology . " <p> Long-term , Lee would like to have include a tutoring school . But instead of teaching content which is the standard method he wants to provide students with a foundation of study techniques . <p> " Having been a high school tutor for the last 20 years , I 've really noticed that learning and studying techniques are n't really picked up by the students they 're either not taught , or they 're taught and then forgotten about , " he said . <p> " What I find is by years 11 and 12 they 're missing sophisticated learning and studying techniques , and that 's meaning that they 're having to work very hard to get grades . <p> " I know there 's some very simple ways of studying and learning so much more effectively , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school learning so by the time they 're in high school they 're excellent at learning and excellent at studying and preparing . <p> " If you can teach a student to learn effectively then they do n't need tutors . " <p> He said working with this mindset is n't necessarily in the interests of a commercial tutoring agency , but , as a for-purpose business , he has an opportunity to change that . <p> " Again that 's where a social enterprise might be different , in that the interest here is in having students go out and be excited and passionate about what they do , " he said . <p> " One of my beliefs is if you 're excited and passionate about what you do , you 're able to follow your passion , then there 's going to be a whole lot more people out there coming up with brilliant and exciting ideas and coming up with enterprises and working in jobs that are really adding to the world because the person doing it is inspired about what they do .

 Democracy <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> More than 30 Not for Profits , community leaders , unions and commentators in civil society have united to speak out about the media treatment of Duncan Storrar and what this says about the current state of Australian democracy . <p> The group have issued a national Civil Society Statement of Concern , expressing concerns about the " intrusive negative scrutiny " has faced in recent weeks , which they argue sets a dangerous precedent across the democratic process . <p> , who was identified as a person with disability experiencing a low income , came to prominence after appearing on ABC 's Q&amp;A on Monday 9 May to ask a question about the budget and tax inequality . <p> The group claims that since asking that question has been subjected to an onslaught of " personal investigations , attacks , intrusion into his privacy , family and ridicule in a range of publications , including The Australian and The Herald Sun newspapers " . <p> " The patent disregard of the impact of this reporting on an individual is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further example of the willingness of parts of the media to vilify and demonise people on low incomes or from marginalised backgrounds , " the statement said . <p> " The issues involved go beyond one individual and represent a turning point for the open debate , discussion , criticism and dissent which underpin our free society . <p> " It is a public right to ask questions . It is the job of the media to report them and the responsibility of parliamentarians to protect our ability to do so . " <p> Craig Wallace , People with Disability Australia ( PWDA ) president , who is spearheading the campaign , said the group had been watching with increasing alarm over the last two weeks " the unprecedented vilification of a man with a disability , experiencing a low income , simply for having his say on a current affairs program " . <p> " This man is not a politician , as far as we know , he is not a lobbyist , he is not a professional person , he is simply like the many thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullied and vilified for taking part in the political process , " Wallace told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " My organisation initiated this , we held concerns this was not just an issue about disability , it was an issue about democracy and the health of civil society more broadly , so together with our partners at ACOSS as well as the other members of the Australia Cross Disability Alliance , we started talking over recent days to a large number of organisation including human right lawyers , trade unions , we 've got St Vincent de Paul , we 've got Tom Calma who is the chancellor of the ANU , all of them with a common concern that democracy is being undermined . <p> " This is an unprecedented response to an unprecedented event . Never in my career in the media , the bureaucracy or in public life have I seen a voter excoriated during an election campaign , simply for asking a question on a valid current affairs issues within a program that was meant for that purpose . " <p> The group have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians over the issue . <p> " It 's also time we heard where our leaders stand on the rights of all people , particularly community members , to participate in public debates without bullying and intimidation , " the statement said . <p> " Political leaders have a positive obligation to protect public participation by people who are less powerful , knowing that more powerful people will otherwise dominate our democracy . " <p> Wallace said the politicians should have been the first ones to speak out . <p> " I think that Duncan has touched a raw nerve in terms of income inequality , in terms of some of the discussions that are going on at the moment around the need for more equity in our system . I also think unfortunately there has been a creeping pattern of vilifying vulnerable individuals who are at the centre of disadvantage . We 've seen that with some of the headlines around people on DSP being described as bludgers and rorters , what is concerning about this to us though is that there has been a kind of vacuous silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ' well hang on , this is one of our voters . He 's being an informed voter , it 's his right to do this , he 's meant to questions ' . <p> " I would have expected that the first people to have jumped up and said ' hey hang on guys this is a bit rough ' would have been the politicians . But they have n't touched this because like many Australians this is a guy who has had a hard life , a complex life with tangled threads and broken strands , he 's like many Australians outside of the Melbourne , Sydney , Canberra cafe belt , he 's got complex families , I grew up in an area like that , I exactly know what it 's like , but it does n't mean that you ca n't hold sway of the Australian population out of our democracy . <p> " That is why all of the undersigned organisations feel so strongly about this . We feel that democracy is being undermined and I never thought that I would be saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the national leaders to reaffirm the rights of all people regardless of background , disability or income level , to take part in public debate free from bullying , personal intrusion , harassment or intimidation . <p> " I want both leaders , Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten , to put aside their differences and both strongly and publicly reaffirm the right of all Australian voters , including marginalised people , to ask questions and take part in the public domain free from bullying and intimidation , " said Wallace . <p> " I want the new human right commissioner ... to look at whether we need an Australian Bill of Rights in order to protect individuals like Duncan and civil society organisations from bullying and vilification in the future . <p> " Lastly I think the media needs to take actually a bit of an introspective look after this and realise that their right to report free from government interference is actually entwined with the free people and the rights of people like Duncan to speak out .

 Reverse Foreign Aid Budget <p> A federal Labor pledge to reverse the Turnbull government 's cut to the international aid and development budget has drawn support from Australian humanitarian relief and development groups . <p> The Campaign for Australian Aid ( CAA ) , made up of more than 60 aid and development organisations , also called on all political parties to commit to repairing the aid budget . <p> Campaign director for CAA Tony Milne said the pledge had the potential to bring an end to three consecutive years of cuts that had seen a third of funding slashed from the aid budget . <p> " The announcement to restore the most recent aid cut of million committed by the Australian Labor Party is an important first step towards repairing the Australian aid budget to a fairer level , " Milne said . <p> " And we call on the Coalition government to match it . " <p> Last week the foreign aid and development sector launched its " fight back " campaign for the federal election , using emotionally evocative and cutting-edge tactics favoured by the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking , fence signs and phone booths to garner support . <p> Tony Milne told Pro Bono Australia News at the time that the campaign style was new territory for foreign aid organisations , but a necessary step after the latest round of budget cuts reduced Australia 's foreign aid spend to its lowest ever level . <p> The shadow minister for foreign affairs Tanya Plibersek said in an election announcement that Labor would also invest an extra million a year , from 2017/18 , to help Australian NGOs deliver frontline services to some of the world 's poorest people . <p> The chief executive of World Vision , Tim Costello , challenged the Coalition to match the pledge to restore the most recent aid cut , saying it was time to return to a bipartisan policy . <p> " We need to think of these cuts not in terms of dollars but in terms of the impact they have on real lives , " Costello said . <p> " Every time we cut , it is the opportunity for education we cut , the wellbeing of children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this is actually what is being trashed . " <p> Oxfam Australia chief executive Dr Helen Szoke said Australian aid had such a dramatic impact on people 's lives , yet it is less than 1 per cent of federal spending and a tiny proportion of the budget . <p> " It 's time for Australia to join with other global nations and start doing our fair share , " she said . <p> CEO of Save the Children Australia , Paul Ronalds , said : " Helping our neighbours is not only intrinsic to our Australian values , it is critical to our national interest , and it should rise above partisan politics . A thriving aid program helps reduce instability while guarding against outbreaks of disease and promoting economic growth in our region . It 's not only good for our neighbours , it 's good for us . " <p> Labor 's funding pledge was also welcomed by the Australian Council for International Development CEO Marc Purcell . <p> " Last year 's federal budget axed billion from the aid program . The 2016/17 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-time low . All up , in the past three years there 's been a 30 per cent reduction in Australian assistance to the world 's poorest people , " Purcell said . <p> " Cuts to Australia 's aid program have ended more than 100 highly effective poverty reduction programs in scores of countries and damaged our reputation with our neighbours . Cutting regional health and biosecurity aid programs has increased Australia 's vulnerability to pandemics like TB , Zika and Avian bird flu and risked our exposure to agricultural threats like rabies and foot and mouth disease . " <p> " We want all parties to commit to rebuilding the aid budget to billion in the next term of Parliament to set Australia on a trajectory to reach 0.7 per cent of GNI by 2030 -- in line with Australia 's commitment to end extreme poverty , gender inequality and tackle climate change under the Sustainable Development Goals .

 Trust to Foster an Inclusive Society ? <p> By Keith McVilly , <p> The Not for Profit sector is uniquely positioned , and some might say ethically obliged , to ask of our political aspirants how their policies will foster an inclusive society , writes Keith McVilly , Professor of Disability and Social Inclusion at University of Melbourne in the first in a series of election analysis . <p> Five weeks away from the federal election , I ask the question , who might I trust with my vote ? In the Not for Profit sector , concerned as it is primarily with the wellbeing and quality of life of our fellow Australians , the answer to this question is critical . But on what basis and against what criteria might I answer my question ; what do I need to hear our political parties and individual candidates articulate so I might know I can trust them to work for the wellbeing of our country and the wider global community of which we are all part ? <p> A brief systematic review of official party political policy statements and a sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual plethora of promises and cross-party critique of issues related to health and education , law and order , defence and national security , tax reform , and the ubiquitous claim to tough economic management . Such issues are often presented as " ends in themselves " ; the commitment to which and achievement of these being posed as evidence of good government for our time and a reason to trust one party over another . <p> But amidst this debate have our politicians lost sight of some of the fundamental reasons for policy development ? Have we challenged them and have they explained to our satisfaction how their policies affect the building of an inclusive society as the basis and source of all our wellbeing ? Policy commitments on education and health care , law and order , defence and national security , tax reform , and economic management can all serve to either undermine or foster an inclusive society . <p> In building the trust necessary to win over the voters of Australia , our political aspirants need to demonstrate that they have considered not only the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which these policies will either detract from or contribute to building an inclusive society . <p> It is only when such a truly inclusive society is realised that we will all benefit from what diplomat , philosopher , and theologian Michael Novak , in 1983 , described as " unity in diversity " : " Unity in diversity is the highest possible attainment of a civilization , a testimony to the most noble possibilities of the human race . This attainment is made possible through passionate concern for choice , in an atmosphere of social trust . " <p> Notably , the importance of this concept to building and sustaining the wellbeing of peoples and nations has been recognised by the European Union in their adoption of the official motto " In varietate Concordia " ( united in diversity ) . <p> The Not for Profit sector is uniquely positioned , and some might say ethically obliged , to ask of our political aspirants how their policies will promote unity in diversity and in turn foster an inclusive society pro bono publico .

 Dramas <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> International development organisation WaterAid has produced a light-hearted short film using clips from popular " period " dramas to highlight the most awkward and raise awareness of issues faced by more than one billion women around the world who do not have access to a toilet . <p> WaterAid 's 10 most awkward moments imagines how the world 's literary heroines may have dealt with their periods in a bid to help remove the silence and stigma that surrounds the issue . <p> Paul Nichols , WaterAid Australia 's chief executive , said we needed to talk openly about the issue as being able to deal with periods in a hygienic and dignified way was crucial to women 's wellbeing . <p> " Whilst our film is light-hearted , we have a heavy heart when we observe how many women in the developing world have to cope with their periods without being able to lock the toilet door behind them , " Nichols said . <p> " When there are no safe , private toilets in schools , girls often skip school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they reach puberty . <p> " We need to talk openly about this issue and remove the silence and stigma that surround periods otherwise it will be much more difficult for women and girls to call for change , such as having access to a toilet and running water at school , that will enable them to deal with their periods and play a full and active part in their society no matter what time of month . " <p> The Not for Profit launched its campaign to mark Menstrual Hygiene Day on 28 May . <p> It follows research that found 67 per cent of women in the UK admitted to adapting their lifestyle because they fear awkward . <p> Three-quarters of respondents ( 76 per cent ) said a major fear was blood leaking onto clothes when out in public , 55 per cent of women said they had a dread of smelling bad , 42 per cent expressed coyness around having to hide sanitary products on their way to the toilet in the workplace , 42 per cent of women said not knowing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while 25 per cent admitted craving huge amounts of chocolate . <p> Only 6 per cent of women reported experiencing no fears of period dramas . <p> The survey also highlighted that most women still consider it an embarrassing and taboo subject . <p> Four out of five women ( 81 per cent ) said they would never ask a stranger for a sanitary product if caught short , while 37 per cent would n't even ask a friend or colleague . <p> More than half ( 52 per cent ) said they felt less confident than usual when experiencing a period drama and most women ( 89 per cent ) agreed that men were at an advantage for not having to deal with period dramas . <p> Nichols said it was an issue that needed attention . <p> " Every woman and girl should have access to facilities to manage her menstruation in a hygienic way , wherever she is , in privacy , safety and with dignity , " he said . <p> " Women in our region are greatly impacted by lack of toilets . In Papua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have adequate toilets and 60 per cent do not have access to safe water . While in Timor-Leste 60 per cent of people do not have sanitation and 30 per cent do not have safe water . <p> " By giving this issue the attention it deserves , we will help ensure every women and girl has access to water , safe toilets and somewhere to wash by 2030.

 The Business of Social Change <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Dawn O'Neil AM is a trailblazer for collective impact in Australia , and has served as an executive in both Not for Profit and public sector organisations . In this month 's Evolving Chair she discusses her role with social enterprise STREAT . <p> Many people are familiar with STREAT 's cafes dotted across Melbourne . The award-winning social enterprise uses its retail outlets as a training ground for homeless disadvantaged young people to gain skills , employment and , ultimately , a sustainable livelihood . <p> Dawn O'Neil was the founding chair when STREAT began in 2007 in Canberra and , after a break from 2009 to 2011 , she returned to the organisation , which is now based in Melbourne . <p> Previously CEO of Lifeline Australia , O'Neil is recognised as a leader in the social and mental health sector . In this month 's Evolving Chair , she shares the importance of innovation and business strategy in creating change . <p> Photo : Lori <p> What is the structure of your board ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a small board , and at the moment we have five other board members . We have a finance and audit committee , we have a remuneration committee which really only forms every 12 months when we do a review of the CEOs remuneration . We also have a ... research and evaluation committee . <p> What attracted you to STREAT 's board ? <p> I had met Rebecca Scott , who 's the CEO and founder of STREAT . I was actually her mentor to start with . She was doing a leadership program through the Vincent Fairfax leadership program , and I was asked to be her mentor . She was , at that time , thinking about starting some kind of Not for Profit or social enterprise , and I worked with her because I was , at the time , still CEO of Lifeline Australia , which actually started very much as a social enterprise . It 's always had a business arm ... many people would n't necessarily know that or call it a social enterprise , but the op-shops and the recycling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other charities like that in Australia . So I was able to share with her a lot of the learnings from Lifeline around running the businesses , because I 'd run the businesses myself at a local level for about five years . <p> What has been the biggest challenge in your time as chair ? <p> I think , really like most Not for Profits or most social sector organisations , it 's that coming down to the wire financially so often . I think trying to be fully self sustaining is a real challenge , even for social enterprises . So we 're still not fully self sustaining yet , but we 're hoping in the next two years we will be with the opening of our new Cromwell site . The aim is that within two years we 'll be self sustaining , but that 's a lot of hard work and that will be 10 years into running the enterprise . <p> How does the organisation plan to achieve financial sustainability ? <p> We have been very successful in getting funding and support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenacious , enthusiastic , wonderful advocate . She believes in what she does , and has great integrity around that , and she works very hard writing out many , many applications to many foundations and funds and philanthropists . So you can never stop that , you 've just got to be very tenacious and hard working around those things . I think also not to underestimate the marketing promotion of your organisation , people need to know about you . It 's like the old saying , we know that only 50 per cent of the marketing works , but we just do n't know which 50 per cent . So Rebecca 's been very generous with her time in agreeing to be a speaker at many events on weekends , at night , at all times of the year . She 's available , she 's generous with her time , she speaks and she shares what we 've learnt at the organisation with others , and I think that 's really helped to build the awareness of the organisation beyond our small footprint in Melbourne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number one , it 's to finish the building in Cromwell , it 's a major exercise to build a big facility with a bakery and new coffee roasting training facilities . It 's a major undertaking , it 's a million building exercise , so we 've had to borrow those funds , fundraise , do the build that will be ready in June . So we 'll be opening our doors hopefully in July of our new facility , so that 's been a massive exercise , that 's the number one priority right now . <p> What 's the highlight of working with this board ? <p> They have been a fantastic board to work with , they 've been willing to take risks -- calculated risks . They 're very diligent and thorough around due diligence , asking challenging questions , having robust discussions , but then letting the CEO get on with the job . They 've been very good at being clear around the governance role versus management , very willing to roll up their sleeves and help in any way possible whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organisation . It 's been an absolute pleasure working with them -- all of them . <p> What sector issues are currently being discussed at a board level ? <p> Probably the one that 's been consistent throughout the whole time is ... current policy and funding priorities around getting young people who have complex disadvantage into work or participation or even stable , safe housing . Current policy just does not fit the reality of what these kids ' lives are like . And the funding streams we have never really qualified under any funding stream in the last 10 years , and yet we consistently support young people to get from homelessness into jobs , and the way the funding is structured is just too disjointed , too exclusive , it goes to certain ages , they have these streams it 's not holistic enough . I think that federal policy around young people and getting young people with complex disadvantage from that place into stable homes and stable lives and into work needs to radically change . <p> Is gender balance an issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a female CEO and I 'm a female chair so that 's not been a problem . We have had three men on the board and three women , so it 's been a very even spread . <p> Does your board believe in collaboration with other organisations ? <p> Very much so . I 'm a big fan we all are -- of collaborative practice . We 've always collaborated with other organisations , we rely on them to refer clients , we work with institutions like TAFE colleges and other training organisations ... and we work very closely in collaborating with the private sector around a whole lot of areas to help us to achieve our goals , and our longterm goal of getting young people away from homelessness and into secure work and training every year . We could not do that on our own no way . <p> What advice do you have around the chair and CEO relationship ? <p> My advice would be that it 's critical for a chair to have a good , open , transparent relationship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chair ... to maintain that relationship , maintain that transparency , make the time . I would always encourage chairs and CEOs to speak at least weekly , making sure you have a good process for annual reviews . In our case we do six-monthly reviews . And it 's just absolutely critical , that relationship , it is the pivotal one , really , for the organisation to function well . <h> Australia 's ' 
 of mental health in the workplace <p> By Leon Gettler , <p> Research conducted for NFP beyondblue has found more than six million working days are lost per year as a result of depression . Freelance journalist Leon Gettler looks at why a mentally healthy workplace is good for business , in this article first published in Blue Notes . <p> A mentally healthy workplace is good for business . Research shows it leads to less absenteeism , more-engaged workers , better productivity and morale . It reduces the chances of a company being hit with workplace disability claims and fines for breaches of health and safety laws . <p> There is a big price tag when employers ignore and fail to manage mental health conditions in the workplace . PricewaterhouseCoopers has estimated it costs business in Australia alone a whopping billion a year . <p> Research conducted for beyondblue has found more than six million working days are lost per year as a result of one mental illness alone -- depression and each worker whose depression is untreated costs their employer . <p> The stats show people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often than those with ulcers , high blood pressure , diabetes , arthritis , back problems , lung problems or gastrointestinal disorders . <p> Apart from depression , the other most common mental health issues are anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , alcoholism , drug use disorder and bipolar disorder . <p> All this inevitably spills over into the workplace . <p> Occupational disability <p> Stress-related physical conditions such as sleeping disorders and low-resistance to infections can result in an increase in overall sickness absence . Work-related stress and poor mental health are major reasons not only for absenteeism but also for occupational disability and for workers seeking early retirement . <p> A recent Harvard study examining the financial impact of 25 chronic physical and mental health problems found workers with depression reported the equivalent of 27 lost workdays per year . Other research has found employees with depression are more likely than others to lose and change jobs frequently . <p> According to Comcare , one in five people in Australia will experience some form of mental illness , like depression , at some stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least nine hours a day at work , there has to be some spill over . <p> That means the workplace can heavily influence the health of workers and therefore the community . Psychologically healthy workplaces are high functioning and productive zones . <p> Managers can talk to the worker and offer the option of bringing a support person to the meeting . All discussions at the meeting , held at an appropriate time and place , have to be kept strictly confidential . <p> If the manager feels uncomfortable , they could bring in a health professional like a psychologist , social worker or occupational therapist . If the person does n't want to talk about it , they should ask if any they need any assistance . <p> Managers can also offer more flexible work arrangements or change aspects of their task . They can also ensure colleagues are not overloaded with extra work . <p> Given the importance of dealing with the issue for workplace productivity , it should be a top priority for managers . <p> beyondblue chief executive officer Georgie Harman has noted big shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace . She has been struck by how managers and executives now seem to understand the importance of it . <p> She says companies leading the way are in the mining and construction industries , two sectors with a big focus on workplace safety . <p> " We do n't talk about it as a feel-good exercise , " Harman told BlueNotes . " It 's actually something good for business . " <p> " It means talking to your staff about what 's happening , " Harman said . " You are not there to diagnose , just to give support . " <p> Global problem <p> Mental health in the workplace is an issue right around the world , including Asia . According to a Singaporean study in 2011 , depressive disorders , alcohol abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder emerged as the top three most common disorders in the country . <p> Extraordinarily , the study found one in 16 people in Singapore have suffered from depression at some time in their lifetime , while alcohol abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder affected one in 29 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Not for Profit organisation in Singapore established in 2006 to combat the stigma of mental health issues , has published a guide for promoting mental health in the workplace . <p> The guide , put together by various mental health specialists , has a number of suggestions which include working closely with organisations to provide education , information and flexible work environments . The publication also offers guidelines on how to handle colleagues experiencing mental health issues and also a list of services . <p> Diagnosis <p> Psychologist Louise Ryan says mental health covers a broad array of issues , some of them psychiatric and some not . Proper diagnosis is important . <p> " When we talk about mental health , we can be talking about diagnosable psychiatric disorders or people struggling with anxiety or mood problems , ' ' Ryan said . " Sufferers may have received a diagnosis or it may not have been diagnosed . " <p> Diagnosed or not , these conditions have an impact at work , she said . <p> " They might even cause disruption in the workplace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they can start not getting along with colleagues . It 's not just the task that becomes difficult ; it can be other aspects of work life . " <p> Ryan says the problem risks being swept under the carpet if the manager is n't up to it . <p> " In good workplaces there 'll be a manager who recognises it and provides support , ' ' she said . " To a manager who does n't understand , this employee will look they 've stopped performing , and they 'll be called in for a performance problem . " <p> While mental health tends to be handled well in larger companies with employee , there 's still some way to go . <p> Ryan says small-to-medium sized businesses tend to struggle simply because they do n't have the resources . <p> Psychologist Dean Janover says all companies need to have regular mental health audits and to develop policies to deal with the issue . <p> " They need to have a plan in place , ' ' he said . " They need to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , what are the kinds of risks impacting on their employees ' mental health ? <p> " They need to develop policies around how they are going to address each of those areas . They need to educate their staff and the people who manage them . They need to put the proper support processes in place , before they pick up the danger signs . <p> " If they do n't have these systems in place , they might not be as well-placed to manage these kinds of mental health issues .

 of Community <p> By Staff Reporter , <p> Phillip Wohlers is CEO of the Old Colonists ' Association of Victoria ( OCAV ) , a leading Not for Profit retirement village provider offering a continuum of care from independent living , assisted living and aged care in Victoria . He is this week 's Changemaker . <p> OCAV was established by Victorian founding fathers including George Selth Coppin , a member of Parliament and philanthropist in 1869 . <p> The association 's first village was located in Rushall Park , North Fitzroy after the government of Victoria gifted an acreage of land . Today their four villages in Berwick , Euroa , North Fitzroy and St Helena are home to 500 older Victorians in need . <p> Wohlers , who has worked in the NFP sector for more than 15 years , has overseen some of the most dramatic changes that have taken place in the almost 150 year history of . <p> In this week 's Changemaker he talks about developing a vision , an organisation and a team that provides a quality service that enriches the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your organisation ? <p> I am investigating strategies to expand affordable community housing options for older people . One of the biggest challenges facing is the demand from ageing Victorians wanting to join one of the four communities . The waiting list at Rushall Park in particular is more than six years , with 400 people on the list . I believe OCAV has a social responsibility to try and offer more accommodation as the population ages . <p> To that end some major developments are underway at Leith Park in St Helena where 49 new units are being built and the first stage is expected to be under way later in the year . At Rushall Park 35 new units will be built on land , which runs along the railway station , and construction is likely to start in 2017 . <p> What drew you to the Not for Profit sector ? <p> The culture , and to be with people who want to make a real , positive difference to the lives of others . I have an accounting background and most of my career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the focus . Coming here was a chance to focus on people and working to make their lives as fulfilling as possible . <p> What was your first job in the Not for Profit sector ? <p> Finance Manager at OCAV . <p> What is the most rewarding part of your work ? <p> Watching people 's lives change for the better . Moving into our community often as individuals to developing friendships and becoming an active part of a vibrant community . Working here is about relationships between staff and residents , and relationships within the community of residents . The way we have established the villages encourages a sense of community we have no fences . There 's a sense that people have their own privacy , but they are part of a shared community . <p> The personalised approach is the culture of care and supporting people to live fulfilled and happy lives . One important aspect is the daily " check-up " on every resident . It 's not intrusive and might be just a knock and a " hello , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents and to me . <p> When a resident comes into an village we recognise that they are leaving their home and community and that is very , very hard for some people . We have a buddy system and when they first come to us we touch base with them very regularly to ensure they are settling in . <p> The culture also impacts on staff . Staff turnover in the industry is traditionally high . At OCAV the average term of employment is between 10 and 15 years . <p> What has been the most challenging part of your work ? And how do you overcome that ? <p> A lack of understanding at policy level of the specific needs of older people in regard to urban planning , housing and housing design . What is being done , or not done , to address the growing need for housing/care for the elderly . <p> To overcome this , we are taking a greater role in advocating for older people which includes talking with politicians , the media , at conferences and to the many people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I consider my greatest achievement to be ... <p> Developing a vision , organisation and team that provides quality service , one that enriches the lives of our residents and stakeholders . <p> I am confident the model has something to offer the broader sector and I would like to see the organisation 's influence expand within the industry . <p> Something is definitely working with bucking the trend on some important indicators . The average age of entry to a retirement village is 73 and OCAV 's is 77 years . The average length of stay is seven years and at it is 10 years . <p> People want to be a part of what we offer here . It 's a good life for everyone -- residents and staff . OCAV is a happy , vibrant place to live and work . <p> Favourite saying ... <p> Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent <p> Through your work , what is your ultimate dream ? <p> That all elderly people , irrespective of the financial situation , have access to quality , affordable housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My greatest challenge is ... <p> To deliver on my dream <p> What does a typical day for you involve ? <p> I am up reasonably early , take the dog for a walk , breakfast and if heading direct to the office usually arrive by 7.30am . My day generally consists of meetings/conversations with external bodies , new/existing residents and my team , with some time set aside to consider and develop strategy . <p> My evening generally involves preparing dinner for family ( cooking is a passion ) and enjoying conversation . <p> What ( or who ) inspires you ? <p> I am particularly inspired by our residents ; their resilience , strong belief in community and willingness to help others . I also get inspiration from our volunteers . We want to increase the number of volunteers across the four villages from 140 to 200 people . A culture of volunteering enhances the lives of residents , often encourages them to volunteer in the wider community and brings the outside world into the village . <p> Where do you feel your passion for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single parent , always found time to help out in a range of community activities and my former CEO who , whilst running a multimillion dollar business , devoted countless hours at senior/board level to charities and NFPs.@@9092861 <p> In a 2005

" ) , the Salvation Army asked me to donate now to stop homelessness three times in the space of 20 minutes , and I was told to make a trip to a local bridal expo . <p> Over on Facebook , the Australian Institute of Business suggested I consider a post-grad qualification and told me I really should be thinking about new season winter boots . <p> According to digital marketing experts , 2016 was to be the year of " big data " , where organisations and senior marketers invested heavily in really understanding the digital needs of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was really the case , why do n't the digital advertisers know that I 'm quite happy with my existing school-aged child , and that I love running and snowboarding ? I just finished my masters and I am highly unlikely to donate to a charity while I am attempting to prepare and transport said child to school . I love my partner , we are happily unmarried , and I 've never purchased shoes online . <p> Digital marketers are getting me so wrong . <p> The Google Display Network pushes ads that reach a massive 90 per cent of internet users worldwide including through apps . <p> It 's a supposedly incredibly sophisticated system , with myriad opportunities for digital advertising to meet any organisation 's needs . Contextually target someone here , remarket at another there , or reach an affinity audience during the day . Then there are the socials boost a post or a page or an action button and boost some more . Put them together and it 's like buzzword bingo for the modern online marketer . <p> So why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an obvious question ... could all of this targeting actually be harming the people you want to connect with ? And could well-intentioned organisations trying to engage with me online actually be wasting their money ? <p> Consider this . Google has paired me with around 5,000 " like " people based mostly on my age and where I live . So those ads I 'm getting for infant-friendly cars are probably also going to one of the 300 of those 5,000 who has been trying unsuccessfully to have a child for the past year . And that bridal expo ad ? That 's probably going to one of the many who ca n't actually get married to their partner according to Australian law . <p> Worse than just being a wasteful exercise , lazy digital marketing can be highly insensitive stuff , and I shudder to think about what this sort of targeting could do to vulnerable people . <p> Whenever I create a website or app , I stick photos of my target audiences to my laptop . I research , research , research . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . Every good app creator , web developer and user experience specialist I know does the same . <p> Then digital marketing comes along and in one swift AdWord , all of our honest , human-focused work is undone . <p> So here 's some advice for values-driven businesses and Not for Profits playing in the digital marketing space do n't place all of your trust in digital companies to advertise in a way that 's right for you . Google , Facebook , Instagram , Snapchat , LinkedIn : They all want your money , but your content will likely just be served up to generic " special interest " groups . <p> Instead , I 'd suggest using Google to create " managed placements " , which give you more control over the actual sites and apps your digital ads are placed on . <p> On Facebook , do n't rely on the special interest groups they suggest you engage with . Look at your top supporters and customers and visit their Facebook pages . What are some of the groups they are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find commonalities and interests there , find what they dislike and do n't engage with , and build your own data for targeting . Every time I have taken this approach , I have created digital campaigns vastly different from what Facebook suggested . <p> With the right amount of effort , digital communications and technologies can be a very effective way to reach your audience , and that 's why I love them . Just do n't rely on the ( money making online advertising ) machine to always do right by you or your organisation . <p> Do your own ( thorough ) research and you 'll be rewarded . You 'll also avoid offending and potentially causing harm to the very people you want to engage . <p> About the author : Jane is the account director of digital for communications agency Think HQ that specialises in PR for projects of substance .

 is Disrupting the Culture of Largesse in NFPs <p> By Natasha Hudson , <p> Not for Profits with head offices not based in the National Disability Insurance Scheme trial sites will tell you they 're ready for a 1 July start up , but disability consultant Natasha Hudson is not convinced . <p> On the eve of the NDIS roll-out , beyond the trial sites , we have yet to see the full impact of this major social change on the disability sector . <p> The change is by no means an easy feat . Not for Profits have a huge task in front of them . The transition from block funding to a user-pays model is as much cultural as it is operational . <p> Speculators will tell you that the larger for-profit organisations are waiting for the sector to settle before moving in . Smaller organisations are merging with bigger ones . Boutique organisations are coming into their own . Larger organisations are either cutting programs and refocusing their efforts or are looking to corner the market . <p> The tyranny of distance <p> I am most concerned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will tell you they 're ready ... but I 'm not convinced . <p> Head offices outside of trial sites seem out of touch with what is happening on the ground . They are blinded to the realities of delivering services in a market environment . <p> These organisations are simultaneously running two business models : block funding and user pays . The problem for these organisations is that the block funding mentality persists over attempts for lean and agile models . Where trial sites are attempting change , head office is stifling their efforts and charging exorbitant shared service administration fees for the privilege . <p> Stealing from Peter to pay Paul <p> The history of the government contracts appears to have indoctrinated a habit in the sector where funding from one area of the organisation props up others . Accountability measures ( as they were ) also created the environment for NFPs to become accustom to paying scant regard for demonstrating value for money or measurable outcomes . <p> As a result , NFPs are behaving more like governments that apply largesse rather than organisations relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the NDIS world order , largesse will no longer be possible ( let alone acceptable ) <p> But I do n't reckon head office has realised this yet . <p> NFPs continue to maintain top-heavy organisational structures which are not viable . Luxuries like having vehicles and advisors , specialists , clinicians on salary is unlikely to be sustainable ( organisations can barely afford to train their staff as it is , but that 's another story ) . <p> It will likely take a " crisis " to ruffle the feathers of those ostriches who have their heads buried in the proverbial sand . When the block funding stops , head office will be forced to listen . <p> Only then , will they begin to understand the true financial risk that their organisation faces . <p> Seize the opportunity <p> No matter how long you wait , the fat will need to be shed . Without a doubt , people will be upset and even protest . <p> You will need the right vision and the right people with the right skills and the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative solutions ( not problems ) . <p> Make the necessary changes to achieve positive outcomes for people with disability , delivered sustainably . Stay true to your values . Just do it better . <p> Ready or not , the NDIS is coming <p> Check your contract variations . <p> About the author : Natasha Hudson moved to Canberra from Canada where she drafted accessibility regulation for the Ontario Government .

 Can Improve Indigenous Employment <p> By Staff Reporter , <p> Non-standard recruitment agencies , more education and ongoing mentoring and support are key to improving the number of Indigenous people in the workforce write Nicholas Biddle , Australian National University fellow , Boyd Hunter , ANU Senior fellow , Mandy Yap , ANU Research officer , and Matthew Gray , ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods director , in this article that first appeared in The Conversation . <p> The latest ABS report on Indigenous people in the workforce confirms an ongoing trend of low participation . Our research shows that non-standard recruitment agencies , more education and ongoing mentoring and support are key to improving these disappointing statistics . <p> While there was a narrowing of the employment gap between 1994 and 2008 , since 2008 this appears to have stalled . The ABS report shows that 58 per cent of Indigenous Australians were participating in the labour force ( that is , they were employed or unemployed ) . <p> Males were more likely than females to be participating in the labour force ( 65 per cent compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-remote areas , compared with those in remote areas ( 61 per cent and 49 per cent , respectively ) . The report also found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over were significantly less likely than non-Indigenous people to be employed . <p> This employment gap results from barriers to Indigenous people obtaining and maintaining employment . On the demand side , the location of jobs , structural change in the labour market and employer discrimination impact on Indigenous peoples chance of finding employment . On the supply side health , education and training , work experience and caring responsibilities limit participation . <p> The report by the ABS is based on data from the recently released 2014 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey ( NATSISS ) . This data reveals a lot about the reasons for the gap in Indigenous participation in the workforce . <p> Education outcomes are a key determinant of employment . An Indigenous male or female with a degree has an employment probability of 85 per cent or 74 per cent respectively . For someone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent and 50 per cent , whereas someone who has completed Year 9 or below it falls to 43 per cent and 32 per cent . Education alone does n't determine employment , but it is a big factor . <p> Current policies on Indigenous employment focus on education but are much quieter on discrimination . The NATSISS data shows that 33 per cent of adult males and 37 per cent of adult females reported experiencing some form of unfair treatment in the previous 12 months ( excluding those who responded that they did not know ) . What is interesting , is that these percentages are higher for employed Indigenous Australians ( 35 per cent for males and 38 per cent for females ) than those who are not employed ( 32 per cent per cent and 36 per cent ) . <p> At work or when applying for work was the second most common source of unfair treatment ( after members of the public ) . It 's not surprising that because of this some Indigenous Australians would be reluctant to engage with the labour market when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment is a very real and very damaging aspect of the labour market for Indigenous Australians . <p> The 2014 NATSISS reveals there are also substantial gender and age differences . Like the population as a whole , employment rates are significantly higher for Indigenous males compared to females for those aged under 40 . For those aged 40 and over , the difference by sex narrows substantially , and an Indigenous male aged 50-54 is actually slightly less likely to be employed than an Indigenous female of the same age . This puts older Indigenous men at the highest risk of unemployment . <p> Our research has identified some policies that have the potential to help Indigenous people get into jobs . These were : <p> pre-employment assessment and customised training in order to get Indigenous job seekers employment-ready <p> recruitment and workplace policies that facilitate an working environment that ensure Indigenous people have an equal opportunity to win jobs ( for example , providing cultural leave ) <p> cross-cultural training for employers . <p> Recruitment is not enough though . We recently noted a number of barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular including overly high expectations ; discrimination and racism ; and lack of recognition of skills and knowledge . <p> Some solutions for retention include : <p> ongoing mentoring and support <p> flexible work arrangements to allow Indigenous employees to meet their work , family and/or community obligations <p> support for the families of Indigenous employees <p> dealing with racism in the workplace through initiatives that address the broader workplaces culture . <p> Ultimately , the evidence suggests that what is happening in the broader labour market is the key determinant of Indigenous workforce participation and employment . At the national level , the state of the economy is key . At the local and community level , changing government support and changing industry structure has a disproportionate impact on Indigenous Australians . <p> The reality though is that we do n't have rigorous evidence about what specific interventions will have a significant , cost effective impact on Indigenous workforce participation . Nor have we listened to the evidence on what has been shown to work ( and not work ) in other contexts . <p> Not only has this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement with what Indigenous peoples think themselves about priorities or policy responses through genuine self determination . <p> About the authors : Dr. Nicholas Biddle is a quantitative social scientist , Fellow at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research ( CAEPR ) and Deputy Director of the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods ( CSRM ) at the Australian National University ( ANU ) . <p> Boyd Hunter is IZA Research Fellow and Senior Fellow at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research , Research School of Social Sciences , The Australian National University , where he has worked for 20 years .

 to of Income on Rent <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Low and moderate-income households are paying up to 85 per cent of their income to secure rental properties in Australia , according to new data . <p> Photo credit : TK Kurikawa <p> The Rental Affordability Index , created by National Shelter , Community Sector Banking and SGS Economics &amp; Planning , revealed that low-income households those on around a week typically pay at least 50 per cent of their income on rent . <p> The index said it was generally accepted that a household is in stress if it pays more than 30 per cent of its income on rent . <p> The index also found that rental affordability problems were extending to professionals who were forced out to fringe suburbs where there were fewer jobs , less infrastructure and fewer opportunities , entrenching their disadvantage . <p> " Essential service workers like teachers , nurses and police are also being affected , potentially leaving service gaps in the suburbs they 're being priced out of , " National Shelter executive officer Adrian Pisarski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to rent in in Australia , but none of our capitals are really affordable places to rent . <p> " Even our regional centres across the country , places like Newcastle , Lismore , Byron Bay , even Dubbo , Parks and Bathurst in New South Wales , those sorts of regional centres all continue to show unaffordable rental housing on average . So for low and moderate income households again , even our regions are n't affordable . " <p> This index , the second of its kind , included historical data dating back to the mid-1990s to determine when the rental affordability crisis began . As Queensland and New South Wales yielded the best data , they were used as proxies for the rest of the country . <p> " What we can see is in Brisbane from 2001 rental affordability has really deteriorated rapidly , and in Sydney that happened from about 2006 , " he said . <p> " All of that is consistent with it being linked back to the increase in capital gains tax discounts 50 per cent for investors in 1999 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase more housing . <p> " You would think that might have made things better for the rental market , but what has happened is that they have really been purchasing existing supply only rather than new supply . They have n't been adding to supply and therefore helping solve the problem , they 've been bidding against homeowners for the same available supply , and therefore locking out generations out of homeownership . <p> " That then cascades down into the rental market and means the rental market has become less , rather than more , affordable . And we have n't had the new supply that would have helped that situation either . " <p> Economist Saul Eslake said that in the early 1990s , first-home buyers accounted for around 17 per cent of the total housing market , with the remainder going to repeat buyers . <p> " By the current financial year , however , the share of total housing lending going to first-time buyers is just 11 per cent , while the share going to investors is rising to 46 per cent , " Eslake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as a result , the percentage of households renting had grown to 35 per cent across Australia . <p> " Single income households are the worst off and the trend over the last five years has mostly seen no improvement , except in Perth , where the mining downturn is likely to have taken the heat out of rents , " Witte said . <p> " Long-term trends in most cities present a pessimistic outlook for rental affordability . More young Australians are being squeezed out of the owner-occupier property market due to high housing costs , and this is driving up demand and prices for rental accommodation , exacerbating the rental accommodation shortage . " <p> Pisarski said that lack of rental affordability would have detrimental run on effects . <p> " Effectively people are in poverty as a result of paying their rent , and we 're pushing low and moderate income households further and further out , and we 're also reducing the level of homeownership in Australia , " he said . <p> " So all of those are negative consequences for the Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to see an increase in homelessness as a result . Far more people are reporting becoming homeless just through an inability to afford somewhere to live . " <p> He said there needed to be a national housing strategy , led by the Commonwealth and involving the states , local governments , the private sector and the community sector . <p> " What we really need to see is the Commonwealth providing an incentive for the private sector to invest in this area so we can get a dedicated supply of affordable housing targeted at low and moderate income households , " he said . <p> " To their credit , the federal government has looked at a financing mechanism to attract private finance , but we 've heard nothing throughout the election campaign about housing affordability or how we 're going to address this problem . <p> " So we really need a national housing strategy , led by a national minister within the cabinet to drive all of the elements that are required to develop a big reform agenda for affordable housing in Australia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dire need for more innovative financial models to support affordable housing . <p> " We 're calling on governments , companies and philanthropists to collectively use their power to create sustainable solutions now , " Cairns said . <p> " billion in funding would deliver 30,000 to 40,000 more homes and go some way to addressing this crisis .

 the Value of Secure Work <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Peak social advocacy organisation Anglicare Australia has released its election Position Paper on Secure Work , highlighting " the immense value of secure work " and calling for a tax and welfare system that supports communities . <p> The statement claimed if Australia is to maintain a robust and inclusive society , then the creation of secure work and life opportunities for people at risk of social and economic exclusion is " essential " . <p> Anglicare Australia executive director Kasy Chambers said it was time " to think about the future we want " . <p> " Work insecurity is one face of an economy that is not operating in the best interest of us all , " Chambers said . <p> " All over the world people are dealing with uncertainty at many levels : from day-to-day employment , to the changing shape of industry and politics , to the environmental health of the earth as a whole . <p> " So when it comes to thinking about the future of work in Australia , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the market forces of the day . " <p> The paper said the workforce had undergone significant change in the last two decades and " its shape , its operations and requirements face further and more rapid change in the near future " . <p> " The growing problem of insecure work in Australia reflects the fact that while employment conditions are changing in response to emerging economic challenges , this has n't resulted in the development of a workforce , workplaces or work culture that can adequately serve the needs of individuals and communities , " the paper said . <p> " We need to build strong , sustainable local economies that are accountable to individuals and communities . " <p> for others , employment provides the security that allows them to engage with and participate in their communities in other ways <p> low paid uncertain work makes it too difficult for those employees and their families to contribute to our society at large <p> all of us need access to lifelong education because the work we are doing is destined to change . <p> Chambers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . <p> " We call for a tax and welfare system that supports , and does not penalise , people and communities building enterprises that meet local needs , " Chambers said . <p> " We also argue that it is time to invest properly in the most disadvantaged people our community for obvious social and economic reasons . And that we should invest in the jobs that a healthy society and planet will need . <p> " A mantra of jobs and growth rings hollow if it does n't reach beyond simplistic market economics and focus on the services and the industries we know we will need . <p> " And access to education and training will only make sense if they are targeted at the opportunities that our changing world will provide .

 Deliver on ' Great Promise ' of NDIS <p> The cooperative business model has the power to support and protect both service providers and consumers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme , according to the sector 's peak body . <p> CEO of the Business Council of Cooperatives and Mutuals ( BCCM ) Melina Morrison said the model would give consumers more choice and control when the NDIS is rolled out in July . <p> " This is just a huge opportunity to allow the consumers of disability services to organise themselves in the marketplace so they have access , basically as bulk purchases , " Morrison told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " The NDIS is predicated on the idea that personalised budgets create more choice and control for people living with disability , but for that to happen you need marketplaces where there is actually that choice . <p> " Cooperatives and mutuals can help organise the market for disability services ... in a way that it can actually deliver on the great promise of the NDIS , which is empowerment to people living with disability choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers , or " budget holders " who received funding under the NDIS , pooled their finances together they would have more service options at their disposal . <p> " It creates the opportunity for them to scale up their purchasing , " she said . <p> " So they might get a better range of services because they can enter the market as a larger purchaser . That 's on the demand side . " <p> Morrison said there were also great opportunities for cooperatives on the supply side of the NDIS , especially for organisations that are likely to struggle under the new service model . <p> " What we 're seeing at the moment is that there are a lot of existing providers of services which are ... not sufficiently large enough or robust enough to compete in the new decentralised marketplace , " she said . <p> " So what they can do is come together in enterprise cooperatives ... so they can scale up and get some backroom efficiency , so they can compete with larger providers . <p> " But at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned and controlled by the service provider organisations , they do n't have to lose their individual autonomy or even the community connections that they 've built up as individual organisations . <p> " We see this as very important , again , to keeping some choice and diversity in the provision of disability services . " <p> The PaRA Cooperative , or parent-assisted residential accommodation , which operates in Sydney , is run by the parents of three young men with autism , as well as their three staff . <p> Steve Anthony 's son Patrick , 27 , had been living in a house administered by a large non-government service provider for five years , with the two other men also living there for three and four years respectively . <p> Anthony worked with the New South Wales Government to combine the three disability support packages and establish a cooperative . <p> " They were used to the house , and that house was run as a model so we had a fair bit of say in terms of how things were done . But the NGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its overheads , " Anthony told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " Actually at the suggestion of a person from ADHC ( Ageing , Disability and Home Care ) , we set up a cooperative to run the house and avoid most of those overhead costs . " <p> He said that cooperatives were " very democratic " organisations , which had benefits in addition to the cost efficiencies . <p> " The rules of the co-operatives mean only people who are actively participating can be members . So the three men with autism would be members if they could function appropriately , but as they ca n't , we do that , " he said . <p> " But their families know them well and know what their needs are and their wants and interests . So we work collaboratively with the staff to see that they 're very well supported and have interesting lives . <p> " In the typical government group home , a person has no say about where it 's located , no say about who else shares the house with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members to interact with them , and all those things are terrible really . <p> " What you want is to have them living where they want with the people they want , supported by the carers who know them and are consistent and care about them , and with a lot of time with their families . " <p> Anthony said that there were also benefits for staff working in a cooperative . <p> " They feel that they 're involved and they can influence how things happen . We have almost no staff turnover as a result because it 's a place where they want to work , " he said . <p> However , there were a number of challenges to setting up PaRA Cooperative . Anthony is now working to create a framework for others who want to form a disability services co-op so they do n't have to " start from a blank sheet of paper " . <p> " We 've advocated to the NDIA National Disability Insurance Agency that we create ... an ' incubator cooperative ' to provide services to help other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , registering a business name , recruiting staff , collecting all the different policies and documentation you need to be compliant with the disability service standards , and so on , " he said . <p> " There 's a lot of not bureaucracy because there are things which are worth doing -- but there are a lot of things which you need to do to be able to operate as a service provider . Most people would baulk at that . <p> " What we 're saying is , look , we 've done it and we 've learnt from that and other people can do the same thing . <p> " Informally I 've helped a number of other families who have done or are going through the process of doing what we 've done . It can be done for anybody from whom this model is suitable . " <p> Morrison also said several changes needed to be made to reduce the barriers to setting up a cooperative . <p> " The first thing is awareness , so it 's great that models like the PaRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , " she said . <p> " We 're starting to see organisations with authority , like the NDIA ... looking at how to facilitate the market for the provision of services . They can also look to the model that 's provided by cooperatives as being part of the solution . That 's an education issue as well . <p> " The second thing is we need to make it easier to set up and run a cooperative . What has happened with PaRA is they have encountered , in their journey to set up what many cooperatives encounter , which is just a range of red tape barriers that are really unnecessary . <p> " And what the Senate inquiry into cooperatives and mutuals has done is provided some recommendations to government of very small fixes tidying up legislation , fixing careless regulatory frameworks so that cooperatives can get on with doing the job they 're set up to do , which is to empower communities , help communities come together to get what they need as a community , as a cooperative . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates and parties to support a level playing field for co-ops and mutuals .

 Coalition 's Youth Jobs PaTH internship scheme and Labor 's Working Futures scheme , professor of economics at the University of Canberra , Phil Lewis , finds there is not much to separate the plans , in this article which first appeared in The Conversation . <p> Photo : Nils / Shutterstock.com <p> Labor and the Coalition have both put forward plans to boost employment for young people but the plans are both based on the same economic reasoning and are little different . <p> Both the Coalition and Labor seek to improve the employability of unemployed youth by providing basic work skills which in turn help them to increase profit for businesses . <p> The essence of the Coalition 's Youth Jobs PaTH internship scheme is that firms will be paid $1,000 to take on young , unemployed people as interns for up to 12 weeks and a further payment of between $6,500 and $10,000 if they hire them full-time . Interns will receive $100 a week on top of their welfare payments . <p> The Labor proposal is part of its Working Futures scheme . Its major features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential personal presentation , interview techniques and job hunting , a six-month work placement with an employer ( paid at a training wage , a percentage of the award wage ) and a Certificate III in a subject of their choice on successful completion . <p> The differences in the two schemes are mostly in their design although at first sight the Labor plan does n't offer as much incentive to an employer to take on young workers , as that of the Coalition . It 's also difficult to see why you would need six months of training in the basic skills which should already be covered by Job Services Australia . <p> Businesses determine the demand for labour and the most important factor in this is wages . Businesses will employ more people ( or increase hours of employment ) as long as the extra revenue generated exceeds the extra cost of employing them . Therefore , extra output and extra employment requires a fall in labour costs . <p> Unemployment is not a problem for most young people it is concentrated among the most disadvantaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chances of being unemployed are much higher if a person lives in a lower socioeconomic area and if a person 's parents have a lower level of education . <p> These young people are unemployed because , given their lack of skills and/or training , businesses ca n't find anything profitable for them to do at the institutionally set wage which legally businesses must pay . It may also be the case that the wage that businesses would be willing to pay ( in the absence of minimum wages ) in order to profitably employ them would not be attractive enough for the unemployed given the level of social security benefits they would get if they did n't work . <p> Contributing to youth unemployment is a combination of external shocks . Globalisation and an increase in the use of technology have significantly changed the nature of demand for labour , while certain inflexibilities in the labour market , such as rigid wages and employment conditions in awards , have prevented adjustment to these demand changes . The effects of this can be seen in the relative growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual work , the relative decline in demand for manual skills and the growth in demand for knowledge-based and people skills . <p> To increase demand , under both the Coalition and Labor policies , wages are reduced . In the Labor plan employers are allowed to pay trainee wages , which are lower than the general award for junior employees , while under the Coalition plan employers are paid a subsidy . <p> To encourage young people to go for jobs , under Labor 's policies they are paid more than they would get on the dole a trainee wage . For a 17 year old in the retail sector is about $10 per hour . This is compared to the Coalition 's $100 per week plus social security benefits . The exact amount depends on a number of factors but for someone under 18 living with parents the Youth Allowance is $237 per fortnight . <p> Already critics are pointing out potential problems . They point to the danger employers will simply take advantage of cheap labour without real jobs resulting at the end of the subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schemes but the policies will still provide opportunities for young people to be exposed to work experience , to develop networks , self-confidence and skills on the job that could lead to a job . <p> Another criticism is that businesses will employ subsidised workers in place of those they would have employed anyway , resulting in no net increase in employment . However both policies still have value in correcting for the exclusion of the most disadvantaged from the labour market that exists now . <p> About the author : Professor Phil Lewis is the director of the Centre for Labour Market Research ( CLMR ) and professor of economics at the University of Canberra .

 : What , Why and How ? <p> By Simon Faivel , <p> What does " managing to outcomes " mean and why are small and large organisations alike embarking on this journey , asks consulting director with Social Ventures Australia Simon Faivel . <p> A few years ago , we were meeting with the CEO and a board member of an Australian Not for Profit organisation . We were sharing the results of their Social Return on Investment evaluation , which looked back at the prior three years of operations . The results showed that the program had not delivered the impact expected , and offered some surprising insights as to why that was the case . The CEO left the meeting clearly shocked and disappointed to discover that the areas of focus of the organisation were not necessarily the areas valued by their clients . <p> ... we are seeing an increasing focus on measuring the things that matter most -- the outcomes of investments and activities that create social change . <p> Given the dedication and sheer hard work of everyone involved , at the time the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The meeting was a catalyst for a rethink of their " theory of change " and changes in some of their programs . It was also a prompt for the organisation to start more effectively " managing to outcomes " . As the CEO said to us later : " I did not want to wait another three years to find out that we are not making a difference in the ways we thought we could . " <p> The results since then have been notable as the organisation has expanded its work and impact . <p> This story is part of a broader trend in the social sector where we are seeing an increasing focus on measuring the things that matter most -- the outcomes of investments and activities that create social change . But measuring is only one half of the story . Real change comes through building a culture in both service delivery organisations and funders that understands how to use this data to manage to outcomes . <p> Managing to outcomes <p> Simply put , managing to outcomes means defining organisational goals , rigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organisation in line with those goals and measures . It means that organisations have the right information to respond and make better decisions to improve program design and delivery in a timely manner . <p> ... they are not always succeeding because their focus is misplaced . <p> The term and practice of " managing to outcomes " was comprehensively described in Mario Morino 's monograph Leap of Reason : Managing to Outcomes in an Era of Scarcity . Morino , co-founder of Venture Philanthropy Partners , one of the oldest venture philanthropy funds in America , argues that both Not for Profit organisations and funders must focus on actively pursuing " meaningful , measurable good " for the clients and communities they serve . Of course , this is exactly what nearly every organisation would argue they are doing , but Morino believes that they are not always succeeding because their focus is misplaced . <p> Why bother managing to outcomes ? <p> Morino argues that there are five key reasons why Not for Profit organisations and funders must manage towards outcomes : <p> To sustain or grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-warming stories towards those that can demonstrate meaningful and lasting impact . Shifts in how government is procuring social services as well as growth in impact investing an emerging market which requires proof that capital is delivering social and economic outcomes are signs of the new times to come . <p> To improve the lives of their beneficiaries : by focusing on managing to outcomes , an organisation is much more likely to be effective in achieving its mission . <p> To find new ways of addressing challenging problems : by building knowledge about what works and why , Not for Profit organisations and funders will be able to develop stronger solutions for the problems they are working to address . <p> To stay competitive and relevant : with increasing transparency within the sector , funders and consumers can start to compare and contrast the services offered by various providers . This in turn increases pressure on all social impact organisations to demonstrate the impact of their programs . <p> Partnerships for big societal impact : organisations need to work together to effect systems change and therefore need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophy behind managing to outcomes ? <p> Managing to outcomes requires an organisation to be very clear about what it seeks to accomplish and how it will measure its progress , and to then use that information to systematically guide organisational decisions . The key part of Morino 's argument is that in order to manage to outcomes effectively , a shift in organisational culture is required . That is , a move away from merely focusing on numbers or technology . <p> Managing to outcomes is underpinned by five principles : <p> Hear the constituent voice : individuals and communities served by the program should be involved in the design and implementation of the organisational assessment efforts to ensure that organisation is measuring things that are relevant and valuable to them . <p> Assess to learn and do : information collected should serve as a guide to future actions . <p> Apply rigour within reason : overly rigorous assessments result in misallocation of resources . Open dialogues should exist between Not for Profit organisations and their funders to determine a suitable level of rigour a level that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be practical there is no need to do everything : measurement should be focused on a carefully crafted set of questions and should not overburden the organisations . <p> Create a learning culture : measurement for measurement sake does not drive impact . A learning culture must exist across the organisation , and must value honest appraisal , open dissent and constructive feedback . Such culture promotes both insight and impact . <p> SVA has seen how these principles can be applied through supporting New Zealand organisation Te Whanau O Waipareira . Their journey towards managing to outcomes demonstrates the importance of developing a learning culture and is described in the SVA Quarterly article How culture grows effective outcomes . <p> A framework for managing to outcomes <p> To help organisations " make a leap " to managing to outcomes , Morino developed a framework . This framework brings together decades of practical experience from experts across private , government and Not for Profit sectors and is as relevant for small organisations through to large partnerships . <p> SVA Consulting has adapted and used this framework with great success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing to outcomes and to inform strategic planning . <p> Framework for managing to outcomes <p> Phase 1 . Triggers <p> To successfully implement a managing to outcomes practice , the organisation has to have in place an engaged board , leadership with conviction and a supportive performance culture . This means that the board must develop a deep understanding of the organisation , who or what the organisation supports and the outcomes it aims to achieve . The board should also keep the executive accountable to delivering on these outcomes . <p> ... the management and staff need to believe in the value of data and have skills to use it to improve results . <p> A strong and visionary leader is essential to herald change in mindset and behaviours required of most Not for Profit organisations or funders to transition to managing to outcomes . This kind of leader is not afraid to challenge a status quo and is willing to overhaul the old way of working . <p> Lastly , the management and staff need to believe in the value of data and have skills to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires an ongoing investment into the learning and development of staff . <p> Te Whanau O Waipareira is an example of an organisation where the board , CEO and leadership team are leading the cultural change required ; they recognise that this will be disruptive to their staff and the sector , and they have committed to this over the long term . <p> Phase 2 . The why and what <p> The next step is to clarify the organisation 's purpose . This means being explicit on why the organisation exists , what it does , who it supports and what impact it wants to have , i.e. develop a clear and compelling organisational logic model . <p> To complete the logic model , the outcomes for the intended beneficiaries through each of the program and/or service the organisation offers must be clearly articulated . SVA uses the " Golden Thread " methodology to identify and prioritise outcomes to develop compelling logic models . <p> Phase 3 . Measurement and data use <p> In order for organisations to manage to outcomes , they need to collect the right data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process is to agree on how progress towards each outcome will be assessed . This process will identify a set of indicators that will provide data about progress . The selected indicators should have a clear linkage to the desired outcomes , be validated and practical . If the information collected does not help guide decision making or inform service delivery , the indicators may need to be reviewed . <p> ... just identifying what to collect , does not mean that staff will collect and use that information effectively . <p> However , just identifying what to collect , does not mean that staff will collect and use that information effectively . Starting small , and then promoting and rewarding the use of data , are some of the ways to ensure the culture of data-driven decision-making permeates across the organisation . <p> YMCA Victoria is successfully implementing this across a selection of its programs . It is also using technology for the collection and analysis of data . The right technology is not a panacea for managing to outcomes , but it will support better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about how YMCA Victoria has done this , see Look before you leap into buying outcomes measurement software . <p> Phase 4 . Managing to outcomes practice <p> Successful execution of the first three phases will help build the right performance management mindset and systems within an organisation . This in turn will help deliver better results through a disciplined tracking of performance against outcomes , appropriate evaluation and informed decision-making . <p> This requires investment into infrastructure and people . Data collection , storage and reporting capabilities are essential , as is ongoing training of staff . However , the ultimate success of this endeavour is dependent on the leaders and the staff of the organisation bringing data to life , as part of their ambition to drive continuous improvement . <p> We are all learning <p> Managing to outcomes is not an end in itself : it is a way of thinking and doing that should permeate an organisation 's culture . The managing to outcomes framework is a useful guide to create and support the foundations and philosophy of any organisation to make better decisions using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great benefit of managing to outcomes is that it gives organisations powerful new tools for learning over time , making better informed decisions , and becoming more effective at what they are so passionate about doing . <p> About the author : Simon Faivel is a director in the consulting team .

 Future Development of Social Impact <p> By Alan Kay , <p> Opinion : Alan Kay , from the United Kingdom 's Social Audit Network , paints a bleak picture of the world 's future , where capitalism wreaks havoc on society . But , he writes , hope lies in community action that has a positive and -- most importantly -- measurable impact . <p> " When eating an elephant take one bite at a time " Creighton Abrams <p> Not without a great deal of hesitation , I want to try and look into the future and try and " see " the future development of social enterprise and , more particularly , the role of social impact . Attempting to predict how present trends will unwind in future years is a fairly dangerous game and one that is setting oneself up for a fall . But here goes ... one bite at a time . <p> As far as context goes we are living in an increasingly connected world with a globalised market . Governments have shrinking control over the wider economy as large , privately-owned corporations play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private ownership . Collective working and organised mutuality are frowned upon in the belief that society exists as the sum of functioning individuals . <p> Over the next decades there will be increased inequality , a decrease in forms of united action by trade unions ( or equivalent ) , welfare will become more dependent on philanthropy and at the behest of the super-rich , personal debt will rise and will continue to be used to control the mass of the population . And ... there will be a rise in a destructive and xenophobic form of nationalism dividing the " us " from the " them " . <p> Amid this turmoil sits what can be referred to as the " third sector " . This includes civic society , volunteering , business with social purpose , community development , clubs and societies . In times gone by they might have expected some form of support from the state as they aimed to improve social and economic livelihoods . In the future their funding will become more and more difficult and they will be pushed into working alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be benign but some will expect the third sector organisations they support to " toe the line " and act in their interests . <p> Some of the more established , and it has to be said , bigger voluntary enterprises will survive and grow at the expense of smaller organisations . This will happen as competition rather than collaboration is encouraged and sanctified by the dispensers of funds and capital . <p> However , within this bleak landscape , I think there will be a counter swing at a local level . As services to communities are gradually withdrawn , local people who are concerned with their community 's future will react by forming local multi-functional community based enterprises intent on improving the " good " of the community . The future of " social enterprise " will be community . It will be based on local mutual self-help and in a way that erases the divide between " economic " , " social " and " environmental " impacts . Instead it will try to address all of these three aspects for the benefit of their particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " social enterprise " sector and indeed the term " social enterprise " will become more and more meaningless . There will be large competitive organisations taking on government contracts alongside the private sector and they will operate so well in the marketplace that the difference between them and privately-owned businesses will be academic . Then , in the alternative direction , there will be the community-based enterprises hanging on to socialist and collective principles in the belief that solidarity and a sense of belonging can provide for the good of all . <p> So where does " social impact " fit into all of this ? Looking into the crystal ball of the future , it is necessary to consider the past . In the mid-2000s , just as social accounting and audit was beginning to gain traction , along came a US import in the form of social return on investment ( SROI ) . It burst on the social reporting scene but over the years it has been increasingly criticised as an approach . It is changing its spots and recognising that monetisation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social enterprises have on stakeholders . <p> In the future this trend will continue and there will be a gradual realisation that the focus in this area should be on regular and systematic reporting by all organisations that want to demonstrate to themselves and others the positive social and environmental changes that happen as a result of their activities . <p> Over the next decade , the split in the social enterprise " movement " will be mirrored in a " split " in the world of social impact . On the one hand there will be an industry around social reporting with an array of tools , structures and off-the-shelf aids to help organisations report on their social impact . Despite this there will be confusion and a call for standardisation . I should imagine Social Value UK and others will be at the forefront of this call and possibly quite rightly . <p> On the other hand , there will be community based enterprises , operating at a small and local level who will look to report not only on the impact that they have but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentials , and the way they deliver their impact . <p> This is where the Social Audit Network ( SAN ) comes in . SAN was set up to support organisations in the community sector . It was established to help organisations account for how they delivered change as well as the degree of change that happened as a result of what they did . In the past and currently there has been an emphasis on this two-fold approach . <p> In the next decade , I think there will be a shift to emphasise the auditing of social reports and not so much on how social reporting can be done . <p> As the decade pans out , more and more people will realise that social reports can be written in many different ways while the developing standards should be around the audit process . You can evaluate enterprises that have a social purpose with clever consultants going in and writing a report . This is not sustainable in the short term and actually disempowers the enterprise . Far better to get the organisation to take charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verified through a thorough and well-constructed audit . <p> report on outputs and outcomes ( usually relating to the objectives and through them back to the overall purpose ) <p> key findings , conclusions and future recommendations <p> Where does this leave us ? I think the global outlook is pretty horrendous and capitalism continues to wreak havoc on communities , societies , cultures and the environment . The glimmer of hope is through community action , which will include community-owned enterprises and businesses . But they want to know they are making a positive difference . How do they do this ? I would argue through adopting and gradually introducing a form of social accounting with an audit attached that provides external and peer review to help them regularly keep track of what they do and how they do it . <p> We shall not be able to eat an elephant with one gulp instead it will have to be eaten in small bites ...

 cent of those asked said refugees should be sent to camps on Manus Island and Nauru and should not be allowed to come to Australia under any circumstances . <p> The results stand in opposition to the bipartisan policy that refugees who arrive in Australia by boat should never be allowed to settle in the country . <p> The Australian Institute spokesperson Tom Burmester told Pro Bono Australia News that the poll showed the policies being enacted by the government do not have public support . <p> " What we tried to do with the poll was to ask questions about some of the policy specifics , " Burmester said . <p> " So I guess the thing was while the debate in Australia has tended to talk in generalities so a lot of ' tough on borders ' , ' protect your borders ' , that sort of general language , there has perhaps not been much discussion of the real specific policies that are playing out in Manus and Nauru . <p> " So we asked about the specific policies and when it comes to those specific measures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition at this stage , does not have support in the results that we had from the polling of 1,400 Australians .

 New Economy ' With Sustainable Social Enterprise <p> By Alan Greig , <p> There is a critical need for more diversity in business , and social enterprise could be the answer , writes Alan Greig , from the Social Enterprise Legal Models Working Group . <p> Sustainable social enterprise can go a long way towards introducing the kind of " values " into capitalism that Kevin Rudd once made reference to in 2009 " the values of equity , sustainability and community " . <p> With the range of " values based " enterprises that are rapidly developing many of them profiled in Pro Bono Australia News -- social enterprise is already setting the pace in this direction . Social enterprise is changing the way we do business . As social enterprise grows in terms of scale and diversity , it will provide a solid foundation for building a people-centred " new economy " by also changing the way that income and benefits are distributed through the economy and within society . <p> How do we know this ? In the UK , they have been tackling the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then chief executive of the Social Enterprise Coalition , said in the UK Guardian newspaper in 2007 : " Britain has a very ' thin ' model of business . The reality , he says , is that there are a range of fantastic business models but a real ignorance about the fact we can use them and be successful . " <p> The point being that there is a critical need for more " diversity " in the way we do business and the way we own businesses . Social enterprise is now delivering this diversity in spades through its operating models which create social impact , community empowerment and stakeholder ownership . <p> The economy is currently dominated by the private corporation where only one stakeholder matters the investor . It is questionable whether this business model is environmentally and socially sustainable . Business systems need to develop beyond the financial bottom line and look to opportunities for involving a wider range of stakeholders -- employees , customers , suppliers and the broader community . <p> Social enterprise business models can do this by delivering social good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achieve this in the mainstream economy through trading activity that is both profitable and self-sustaining . Social enterprise is not anti-market nor is it anti-capital though they are not based on maximising returns to shareholders through capital ownership ( profit distribution is mostly limited to re-investing into the social mission of the enterprise and capital gain is often restricted through an asset lock ) . The social enterprise belief system is that people and their knowledge are more powerful than money and that collaboration can be more effective than competition . Also , some forms of social enterprise cooperatives for example are re-invigorating the self-help , mutualism and trust of the " old days " when these values underpinned social activity and civil society . <p> To sustain the social enterprise mission , shared ownership , governance and reporting structures are instrumental to their design and operational makeup . With appropriate design and management talent , any of the existing forms of incorporation in Australia can contribute to transformative change in the economic system through trading activity . There are already dozens of variously incorporated social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia . Together , they represent a kind of emerging " fourth sector " operating beyond the traditional sectors of business , government and Not for Profits . In fact , most represent a blend of the best elements of each of the other sectors : self-sustaining like businesses , focussed on social impact like Not for Profits , mitigating inequality and injustice like democratic governments . <p> Social purpose legal structures tend not to be " new " however -- they are usually adaptations of older themes , such as : <p> hybrid organisations ( Not for Profits with income generating , often for-profit subsidiaries ) . <p> The nature of social enterprise means that it can manage well the trade-off between financial return and social impact within any form of incorporation . However , only some forms of incorporation can facilitate stakeholder participation and shared ownership . Opening up one 's structure to different ownership involvements can be complicated , but " conversions " towards this end should not be discouraged . <p> Structure is driven by business strategy the management mantra of " structure follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by social objective right , and the rest should follow through a business plan covering market , revenue , finance , ownership preference and legal form . The legal form will provide the foundation for operations in terms of constitution , rules and governance arrangements . Good governance will then maintain accountability , reporting and sustainability . <p> Business strategy is not always easy for social enterprise , with the ongoing need to integrate social mission with commerce . However , to " be " a social enterprise you need to be well versed on the key elements that will qualify you as a social enterprise . To understand these , I would recommend the excellent , short brief , titled What Makes a Social Enterprise a Social Enterprise , which you can see here . <p> Sustainability should improve as one builds the organisation and scales up operations . Not all social enterprises succeed in doing this some will fall by the wayside . Access to finance is a dominant issue and this often means that legal form is modified to facilitate raising appropriate forms of finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations ( as well as diversity ) . Such needs appear to be different for the three interest groups involved in the social enterprise sector : <p> Social entrepreneurs tend to use a variety of legal structures depending on their business model and financing needs , with some operating as sole traders or pty ltd companies . <p> Group enterprises are covered by cooperatives , community ( and employee ) ownerships and Indigenous corporations . <p> Not for Profits are a broad field and include charities , associations , trusts and Not for Profit start-ups . <p> In some developed economies the UK and Canada most notably -- specialist social enterprise legal forms such as the community interest company ( CIC ) are being legislated for . These new forms are capable of addressing a range of social enterprise specific organisational and finance needs , including equity investments and stakeholder participation . Over 11,000 social organisations have now incorporated under the CICs legislation in the UK since it was legislated for in 2005 and CICs have become the fastest growing form of social enterprise in that country . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIC structure , see my previous article , Community Interest Companies ' Could Change the Face of Social Enterprise in Australia , here . <p> While space is not available to explore in depth all the issues involved in sustainable business operations and organisational development , the opinions above hint at what a " new economy " could look like if it was populated by a greater number and more diverse range of operating social business forms . To study this future , there is a conference in August , called Building the New Economy : Activism , Enterprise and Social Change , which will address the issues involved . <p> The conference will have as one of its aims developing a " new economy coalition " in Australia along the lines of that now set up in the US. <h> 2 fast-growing law 
 Turnbull Government , a Mantra of Courage and Compromise <p> By Sara Bice , <p> Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull 's electoral victory earlier this week heralds another period of weak government , hounded by internal factional jockeying , writes Sara Bice , socio-political commentator from the Melbourne School of Government at the University of Melbourne . <p> In a victory speech that was more conciliation than crowing , the Prime Minister admonished that , " it is vital that this Parliament work " and promised to work with crossbenchers " consistent with the Liberal 's policies " . <p> Already Wednesday morning , signs of conciliation on all sides are appearing , with Labor set to agree to the Coalition 's superannuation tax changes , pending an independent review . <p> Meanwhile , the Australian Building and Construction Committee , which triggered the double dissolution election in the first place , also looks likely to pass , with 112 of 114 required votes from the joint houses anticipated to be locked in . <p> Other policy issues look likely to stalemate . As negotiations continue , pundits suggest the Nationals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a carbon tax will remain off the agenda . <p> What do these early moves suggest for other policy issues ? <p> The short and honest answer is , it 's still hard to tell . <p> A few seats remain outstanding , including the Queensland electorate of Herbert , where incumbent Liberal National Party candidate Ewen Jones appears likely to take the seat as postal vote counts creep in his favour . This one seat would boost the Coalition 's House position to 77 , providing the slightest edge and reducing the number of crossbenchers with which the government must negotiate . <p> Similarly in the Senate , a boost to the Coalition 's numbers to secure 30 seats in the final count would see the prime minister needing to acquire the support of five to six crossbenchers . A smaller but still challenging amount . <p> So , what can we say about policy expectations and government effectiveness at this stage ? <p> Clearly , it is a numbers game . And it is one which may be a harbinger of a slow but progressive end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninety-five percent of eligible voters contributed to the 2016 election result , and their votes solidify a trending fragmentation of the voting public away from the major parties . According to University of Melbourne political analyst , Nicholas Reece : " The 45th Parliament will have the biggest and most diverse Senate crossbench since Federation . Recent experience suggests this will make the passage of legislation difficult . " <p> The government , as it is currently forming , will demand astute negotiation skills . And this requires courage and compromise . The prime minister will need to maintain conviction on divisive policy issues and be staunch about which policy positions are non-negotiable , both from the perspective of his party 's and his personal values . <p> And what does the government , in its likely form , suggest for Australia 's Not for Profit sector ? <p> There is certainly no one-size-fits-all answer . But in a divided and weak government , it will be the cohesive voices those which achieve articulate , multi-stakeholder consensus that will be most effective . <p> Portions of the NFP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election campaign , forming coalitions around critical issues . A similar approach and strong , united voice will be necessary to progress policy in a divided government . And it is one we might hope the government will mimic to effect policy . The alternative may be seen as determined , but in many cases , it will simply be cowardly .

 the Wheel of the Luke Batty Foundation as CEO <p> Family violence campaigner , Rosie Batty has taken her place as CEO of the Luke Batty Foundation . <p> The former Australian of the Year , who set up the foundation in 2014 after her son Luke was killed by his father at cricket practice , said she was excited to be taking the wheel . <p> " I am of course extremely honoured to be taking on additional responsibilities as CEO and am excited to be taking the wheel at this new stage of the foundation 's growth , " Batty said . <p> " I am confident that the foundation 's awareness raising and prevention programs such as the Never Alone campaign will continue to be at the forefront of the national movement to end family violence in Australia . " <p> Batty thanked the outgoing CEO Loretta for her work with the foundation , which aims to raise funds to support women and children affected by the trauma of family violence . <p> " We are extremely grateful for the tireless work of Loretta . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> , who was appointed as CEO in December 2015 , told Pro Bono Australia News the plan had always been for Batty to take over . <p> " I was brought in as the inaugural CEO , Rosie has been very busy travelling this year and a number of things had been locked in already . So it was always the plan that she would be CEO , it was a just a matter of when she was available to do it , " said . <p> " It has been fantastic , but it has been really quite tough because of the high profile of the organisation . <p> " It just was a startup , we only got DGR status last year , so it was really putting the building blocks in , for the organisation to go forward . <p> " It has been a challenge but it has been very rewarding . <p> " Family violence is such a difficult area and Rosie has put it on the national agenda , so it has been a unique opportunity to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a very respected board , high profile board . " <p> said she had helped build the Luke Batty Foundation from scratch . <p> " When I first came there was only two people on the board so it has been a building of the entire organisation , from the ground up and the strategic plan . We did n't have any of that , so I started doing the scoping document and the strategic plan , it was really putting everything place , " she said . <p> " When I first got there I had to go and buy a phone and a computer . It was starting from scratch . " <p> As part of the foundation 's new staffing structure , the organisation will also hire a chief operations officer , to support Batty in her public and strategic engagements , and the day to day operations of the organisation . <p> said the business model will help carry the foundation forward . <p> " Rosie is fantastic but she is travelling a lot and she will continue to travel but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we have an outward looking CEO , if you like , and then the COO more of an operational type person , we think that is a model that will go forward ... Oxfam International have a very similar model , " she said . <p> " Rosie now has an EA and someone around social media and the board is in place and we are getting a COO so it is all looking good . <p> " I would like it to be the foundation that is an authority on family violence . <p> " Rosie has a vision of always being collaborative and working with people in the sector who have the knowledge rather than we try and do it all . <p> " We are working with Our Watch for example , around respectful relationship education in primary schools , we 've got a major grant from the Myer Foundation to undertake that work , but we are not running the program , because we do n't have the people on the ground but Our Watch do , so it is a partnership like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working with the people who have the knowledge and skills , but not necessarily undertaking the programs ourselves at this stage . " <p> said she was not sure what she would do next . <p> " It has been such a busy role , I ca n't tell you . It is a full-time job looking for a full-time job so I have n't applied for anything , I have n't even really looked , " she said . <p> " So yes , I will be looking to do something within the sector but I am just not quite sure what at this moment . I am having two weeks holiday with my husband , I can feel I will be all spiritually renewed when I come back and then I will have a look at what is out there . " <p> Chair of the board Andrew Fairley AM said the foundation had benefited enormously from 's leadership and commitment and they looked forward to continuing her work . <p> " In just seven months , Loretta has successfully steered our fledgling foundation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow and begin new projects , " Fairley said . <p> " The challenging start-up process including board recruitment has been navigated expertly despite the pressure of high expectations and this extremely busy time for the entire sector . <p> " It is with great pleasure that we announce Rosie Batty as the new CEO to continue both Loretta 's work and her own . <p> " Through her leadership role at the Luke Batty Foundation , Rosie will continue to be at the forefront of the national conversation around family violence and the leading initiatives to address it .

" <p> Sly , who comes from Cullulleraine which has a population of 50 , and was one of only two VCE students at her local school in Werrimull , said she was keen to pursue a career in rural Victoria . <p> " I love the feeling of being part of a tight-knit community and I 'm excited about the impact my job as a nurse will have on people of all ages and backgrounds , " Sly said . <p> The nursing student at La Trobe University 's Mildura campus , said her interest in nursing came from her passion for biology , combined with her love of working with people . <p> " Nursing really appeals because I 'll be able to comfort , support and help others on a daily basis , " she said . <p> Charlotte Lakey <p> Fellow winner Lakey , from Kyneton , who is completing a nursing course at Australian Catholic University said she also wanted to work in the country . <p> " I love the community and the fact that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since enrolling at university , she has also joined the OUTLOOK Rural Health Club , part of the National Rural Health Student Network , which she said helped her stay connected to rural health while studying in Melbourne . <p> " Everyone has a right to access health care , but sometimes that is hard in Australia because of the tyranny of distance , " she said . <p> " Practising in rural Australia one day means I will be acting as part of the solution . " <p> Claire Hammond <p> Meanwhile Hammond , a first year dentistry student at La Trobe University in Bendigo , said she wanted to help make dentistry more accessible and affordable for rural communities . <p> " The joy of changing a person 's life by creating a beautiful , healthy smile that brightens up the whole room is unquestionably the biggest reward of a dentist , " Hammond said . <p> " And the thought of being able to help those in need with choice of health professional often crosses my mind .

 ' Painful Realities ' of Australian Life <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Australia is facing a growing wealth divide between the young and the old , with expectations that by next year less than half of all adults will be able to own their own homes , according to a new report . <p> The annual , Household , Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia ( HILDA ) survey , collected by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research , has revealed there is a rapidly growing wealth divide between generations , which could have " socially undesirable consequences " . <p> The HILDA report , the most comprehensive long-term study of Australians , found the wealthiest households in Australia were couples over 65 , who had experienced a real increase in median net wealth of almost 70 per cent since 2002 , compared to just 3.2 per cent among people aged 25 to 34 . <p> At the same time the survey , published on Wednesday , showed the number of homeowners in Australia was falling . <p> Report author , Professor Roger Wilkins from the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was putting pressure on the younger generations , while older generations benefited from the large increases in house values . <p> " I think what we are seeing in the housing market is declining homeownership amongst younger people and an increasing likelihood that many of these people will never own their homes , and I think in the Australian context that has socially undesirable consequences . <p> " I think given the fairly insecure nature of tenure in private rental accommodation , homeownership is definitely a preferable living arrangement for most people and generally homeowners tend to be more invested in their local community and feel like they have more of a stake in Australian society more broadly , so I think to the extent that we are seeing declines to the point where possibly next year fewer than half of all adults in Australia will own their own home . I think that is an undesirable trend for social reasons . " <p> The HILDA Survey , which has been running since 2001 and is funded through the Department of Social Services , collects information on a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , employment , education , income , expenditure , health and wellbeing , attitudes and values on a variety of subjects , and various life events and experiences . <p> Information is also collected at less frequent intervals on various topics , including household wealth , fertility related behaviour and plans , relationships with non-resident family members and non-resident partners , healthcare utilisation , eating habits , cognitive functioning and retirement . <p> Key findings from the latest report included : <p> People are starting families later . In the last decade there has been an increase in people in their 30s , and a decrease in people under 30 , becoming pregnant . <p> Spending on childcare has increased significantly from 2002 to 2014 : 109 per cent and 132 per cent respectively among couple families and single parent families who use childcare . <p> Child care expenditure is rising faster than household incomes . <p> 60 per cent of people who experience poverty only experience it for one year or less , while 8 per cent of people who experience poverty , will do so for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disability , low levels of education , the elderly , the Indigenous community and living in non-urban areas . <p> Welfare reliance among working-age people is increasing , but only slightly . <p> Nearly 70 per cent of all households contained working-age people who received welfare at some point . <p> Given that less than 20 per cent of working-age individuals receive income support in any given year , and relatively few people received welfare for seven or more years , the welfare system does indeed provide temporary rather than long-term support for most recipients . <p> There was a 37 per cent real increase in median wealth of Australian households between 2002 and 2014 , bringing the 2014 average to just over $400,000 . <p> Approximately two-thirds of households are home-owner households , although this proportion has been steadily declining over the 12 years of the survey . <p> Mean home debt has almost doubled in real terms from 2002 to 2014 . <p> Superannuation is held by almost 85 per cent of households and is the second most important asset . <p> 60 per cent of adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent in 2001 . <p> Home-ownership has declined significantly since 2001 . It is likely that in the next few years less than half of adults will be home-owners . <p> In 2014 , new questions on " material deprivation " were included in the survey to provide more direct information on those faring worst economically . <p> Among the findings were that 12 per cent of households did not have $500 in savings for an emergency , 8 per cent did not have home contents insurance because they could n't afford it , and 5 per cent could not afford dental treatment when needed . <p> The latest survey also found that the gap between high and low earners was gradually widening . <p> Wilkins said the data exposed some " painful realities " in many of the nation 's households . <p> " We 're seeing high poverty rates for single parent families . Almost 20 per cent of single parent families are lacking basic essentials , " he said . <p> " Nearly 70 percent of all Australians households have received some form of welfare benefits between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in real terms , paying more than double the fees they were paying in 2002 . This is despite 25 per cent of families relying on grandparents for childcare , who provide an average of 14 hours of care per week . " <p> The average annual disposable income per household ( at December 2014 prices ) has risen from $58,000 in 2001 to $76,000 in 2014 , an increase of just over 25 per cent . <p> " We are in a new economic world where incomes are not on average growing , wealth is not on average growing , and certainly that is not as attractive a proposition as the strong growth in both income and wealth that we saw prior to the GFC , but that said we are not going backwards , " he said . <p> " I think perhaps one of the remarkable features of Australia since the economic slowdown is that inequality has n't discernibly risen and poverty rates have actually declined slightly , since the GFC , so to date Australia has handled the slowdown quite equitably but whether that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm not entirely confident , because one of the ways this slowdown has been handled is that the government has gone into increasing debt and eventually that will have to be reeled in and so as measures are taken to reduce the deficit I think the risk to lower income household is much greater than the risk to higher income households . <p> " I think we do face the prospect that income inequality will widen and economic disadvantage will increase over coming years , but it all depends on what particular budget measures are introduced to bring the deficit down and so it 's certainly not inevitable that that will happen . " <p> Wilkins said the HILDA survey was a " crucial tool " for policy making and to understand the social and economic direction of the nation . <p> " It is Australia 's only nationally representative longitudinal study , so that 's its key distinguishing feature , " he said . <p> " Since 2001 we have been interviewing the same people and so really charting their life course , seeing the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic journeys , and that I guess speaks to the other strength of the study , is its the richness of the data . <p> " We collect information on virtually all aspects of life in Australia be it employment , income , health , wealth , education , family life and so on , and so that richness combined with its longitudinal nature really makes it a unique source of information about life in Australia .

 of Violence <p> Arman Abrahimzadeh is the co-founder of the Zahra Foundation Australia , a White Ribbon Ambassador and a passionate advocate against domestic violence . He is this week 's Changemaker . <p> Domestic violence was a normal part of childhood for Abrahimzadeh and his two sisters , Atena and Anita . <p> In 2009 they fled their family home with their mother Zahra . But in March 2010 their father , , murdered their mother in front of 300 people at an event at the Adelaide Convention Centre . It was their mother 's 44th birthday . <p> and his sister , who moved to South Australia from Iran with their parents in 1997 , were left to parent their 11-year-old sister and continue their mother 's battles in court . <p> , who was named Young South Australian of the Year , vowed never to follow his father 's footsteps into a cycle of abuse and has instead turned his family 's tragedy into a way to help others . <p> He works with various organisations to support victims and raise awareness . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domestic Violence Service to establish the Zahra Foundation Australia to support women and their children to live a life free of violence and attain economic independence . <p> In this week 's Changemaker he talks about why economic empowerment is so important , the need for role models and how his mother 's memory keeps him motivated . <p> Why did you decided to start the Zahra Foundation Australia ? <p> There are actually two reasons for it . One is the research that was being done in this space . We were finding out that a lot of the women who are n't leaving these abusive homes , are n't leaving because of financial stability and I guess financial dependency on their partners . So that was one reason . <p> The other reason for it , was we looked at our situation when we fled our family home ... when we left our family home , I was a final year university student , my older sister was a final year uni student and my youngest sister was 11 years old . My mum did not have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and we found ourselves facing three major issues , one was poverty , one was homelessness , because we just had the car , we did n't have a place to spend the night , or did n't really have , as I said , no family or friends to really go to , and we found ourselves quite isolated . The community did n't really want to have anything to do with us , we found that I guess because we were sort of seen as the domestic violence victims , the support and assistance was limited . So I guess when we looked at those factors and when we saw this was one of the major factors in breaking the cycle of violence , that was why we went down the path and made financial literacy and economic empowerment the core objective of the foundation . <p> Do you think your personal experience of domestic violence has better positioned you to help others ? <p> Well I guess I 'll have a better understanding , so with me and my sisters , and anyone who has experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will appreciate what they 're going through , and they 'll really understand what they are talking about . Because , put it this way , if someone comes to me and starts talking about a brain tumour and the effects of it , sure I 'll be able to sit down and understand to a degree but I 'm not going to get the full appreciation of it because I have n't been through exactly the same thing , so that appreciation and that understanding and also the response , is going to be limited . And so I guess that is one of the factors that makes our organisation so reputable is that we are behind the foundation , as I said , one of the major reasons why we set it up was to help the women and children whose situations we were in when we fled our family home . <p> And I guess the other factor that makes our organisation so reputable is because of our strong connection within the South Australian Domestic Violence Service . <p> What needs to change to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic violence , and I guess my understanding of the sector and of the issue it is this ; we are fighting it on two fronts . We 're dealing with victims at the crisis end , so those who are coming out of abusive homes and I guess those at the crisis end . So that is one of the fronts we are fighting this issue . <p> The other front , is the prevention space that we are working in , so I guess organisations like Our Watch , organisations like White Ribbon Australia , those sorts of organisations , they do good work in the information space , I am an ambassador for both of those organisations , but they are involved in a lot of research ... and they are involved in a lot of different campaigns that I guess promote the prevention and elimination of violence against women and children . That 's I guess , I know , it 's not really answering your question but when you sort of look at the issue , it is such a broad issue you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money at it , then it 's going to fix it , because that 's not the case . Or if you say well if we have more resources , then we 're going to help it , because that 's still not the case , sure if you throw more money and resources you might be able to help people at the crisis end , those who are coming out of abusive homes , but are you going to do anything right up front in order to prevent the issue from happening in the first place ? <p> So I guess if I was to answer that question , I would say you really have to look at both of those measures , the forms of assistance at the crisis end and also the forms of assistance and organisations doing the work in the prevention space as well . <p> As you mentioned , you are a White Ribbon Ambassador and a passionate advocate against domestic violence , in that role you often speak in schools , how important is it to raise awareness with the younger generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment when we look at this issue we are seeing more and more victims going to the domestic violence services and the shelters , so I guess in order to reduce those numbers we really need to stop this sort of abuse from happening in the first place . <p> So to do the work in schools and also sporting clubs too , and the reason why I say sporting clubs is because some of those guys look up to certain AFL or NRL stars as their role models , so if we go in and talk to them about , if we talk about gender equality , because that really is the underlying cause of domestic violence , so if you talk to these kids about it , and they search around and see that one of their AFL stars has been accused of some form of violence or abuse , then they will at least be educated enough , they 'll be trained to acknowledge that and understand it , and I guess you know , they wo n't look at it and say well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ok for me to do it , because unfortunately , that 's happened from time to time . <p> I guess you know what , that is exactly the same principal when you look at family , you might have a young boy who is looking up to his dad , looking up to his older brother , uncle or someone older as a role model , and I guess I did exactly the same thing , I looked at my dad and unintentionally you pick up certain traits , you pick up certain things , and for me it was , in my head , for a long time it was ok to resolve a conflict by violence , I unintentionally picked it up and so that is exactly the same thing , when you 're a role model for someone , what you do and what you say is copied . So we have to be very careful of what we say and what we do in front of the younger generation because unintentionally and naturally they pick it up and they mimic it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you consider yourself a role model for young Australians wanting to make a difference ? <p> I like to think so I guess . I get this question thrown at me all the time , where they say , actually it 's not really a question but I get a form of justification thrown at me , where they say " hey I grew up in a violent and abusive home myself , so violence is the only way that I know " , I mean , sure I understand it but I do n't accept it . Because I say this , I say well , there are lots of people like me who have grown up in abusive homes , and they have actually learnt that violence is the answer and is the way to go about things , but then does that give me a reason or an excuse to go out and do what my father did ? Does that give me a reason to act as he did ? You know , I was raised and disciplined by a murderer , does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad did ? Well no . Like I said it is a reason and it is an excuse , as much as I understand it , I do n't accept it . <p> You were a National Finalist Young Australian of the Year 2016 and Young South Australian of the Year , how does it feel to be recognised for the work you are doing ? <p> I am honoured . I was quite speechless when the announcement was made . But I 've said this publicly , I have been advocating for the past four years or so and there are many organisations out there who have been doing great work for 20 , 30 , 40 years and so what I have done , I have actually dedicated my award to these organisations , and throughout the year I 've picked 12 organisations and once a month I go out to the organisation and I actually give them the trophy to hold on to for the month because as I said , I have only been around for four years , that 's not long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognition but there are many other organisations who have been around and have been doing great work for a lot longer than I , and so I really wanted to acknowledge their work and give them some credit , because if it was n't for certain organisations , just like the shelter who helped us out , god knows where we would be today . <p> What challenges are facing your organisation ? <p> Kylie O'Callaghan , fundraising and marketing manager for the Central Domestic Violence Service , which administers the work of the foundation will probably be able to tell you a little bit more about that . But I guess here 's one challenge , domestic violence is not a ... savoury topic , it is not attractive , and it should n't be , and it 's not , but it 's not an easy space to be in when you are a Not for Profit trying to raise funds . Because as you can imagine , if it was related to anything else where people may find it more attractive in terms of donating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for us , I personally have found , that fundraisers , when I 've had to explain what domestic violence is all about , and what the foundation does , I just find it is not an easy topic to first of all talk about , it is confronting , but also it is not an easy Not for Profit to sort of fill so that 's been one of my challenges . <p> What keeps you motivated ? <p> Memories . Memories of my mum , memories of us as a family , you know the morals and ethics that my mum taught us , you know , I 've got photos all throughout the house and I guess , not to get into too much detail , it was something that should have never happened , this murder could have been prevented but now that it has , I am trying to reflect what my mum would have stood for and what she wanted . And so she was a typical mum , she was kind , she would care and she was always so nurturing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we hold onto and we try to show that to the people , this is who my mum was , this is what she was all about and we try to put that into the foundation and I guess that 's what keeps us motivated . <p> Do you see yourself working in the Not for Profit sector as a career ? <p> I actually do n't work in the sector , everything I do in the sector I do on a voluntary basis anyway , so my involvement with the foundation is voluntary , the work that I do with Our Watch and White Ribbon is voluntary , I am a board member for a couple of Not for Profit organisations who do work in the domestic violence sector and that again , they 're Not for Profits , that 's voluntary . I do n't do actual work in the sector . My industry is design and construction , that 's what I do for a living . So I 'm not sure if I 'm going to stay in design and construction for a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector but I 'll see where I end up . <h> Kiwi cooperative launches 
 Slammed for Calling Homeless " Inconsiderate " <p> A sign posted outside a Bank of Melbourne branch has caused outrage after branding a homeless person as " inconsiderate " for sleeping in the foyer . <p> The Footscray branch put a notice on the door informing customers it had to close the foyer with the ATMs . <p> The sign read : " Due to an inconsiderate person using the foyer as a place to live and litter , we are having to close this part of the branch until further notice . " <p> A photo of the sign was posted on Facebook by Gemma Carafella sparking backlash against the bank on social media . <p> In her post Carafella said the bank was " out of touch " and she highlighted the irony of the bank being a sponsor of the Melbourne City Mission 's Sleep at the G event . <p> " You refer to an ' inconsiderate ' person who has been so selfish as to be homeless . WOW , " she said . <p> " I do n't know if the fat cat bankers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a rebranded portion of Westpac ) are aware of the realities of homelessness , but let me give you a few stats : <p> More than 20,000 Victorians are currently experiencing homelessness ; <p> 33 per cent of those people are homeless because of family violence ; <p> -- Mental and physical health issues are intricately linked to homelessness ; and <p> It almost seems too simple to have to explain , but sleeping rough is dangerous . <p> " To think that the biggest victim in the scenario described in the sign is the bank demonstrates a fairly startling disconnect between your bank and the struggles of people who are experiencing disadvantage . You are out of touch . " <p> Bank of Melbourne has since replied to the comment , thanking Caravella for letting them know and apologising for any offence . <p> " We apologise for any offence taken as this was certainly not our intention , " the reply read . <p> " We will be addressing this directly with the branch manager , and will have this removed as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . <p> " Taking down the sign wo n't address the horrible attitudes behind it . What are you doing about those ? " she said . <p> The original post has since been shared nearly 4,000 times and attracted more than 300 comments . <p> In a reply to the post Matthew McKenzie said it was a " matter of life or death " . <p> " To those who are defending the bank ; have you even noticed how cold it 's been getting the last few weeks in Melbourne ? Could you imagine sleeping rough in a park or under a bridge by the Maribyrnong these cold nights ? If you had the capacity to put yourself in another 's shoes , you 'd realise that to the customers / business it is purely an inconvenience , but to the homeless it is quite literally a matter of life and death , " McKenzie said . <p> Some Bank of Melbourne customers have threatened to take their business elsewhere . <p> Rachael Winter said : " Absolutely disgusting Bank of Melbourne . I 'll be changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , other people were quick to defend the bank . <p> Aaron Dato said : " Ok , so the banks sign was n't PC enough for you , but would you like to see all banks , shops , businesses opening their foyers for homeless people to live in ? If this bank is indeed sponsoring an event for Melbourne City Mission then this is a much better way to show their support . " <p> Sam Ferris is 
 Shadow Ministry for Charities <p> Andrew Leigh has been appointed to the newly created position of shadow minister for charities and Not for Profits as part of Labor leader Bill Shorten 's front bench shakeup . <p> Leigh told Pro Bono Australia News on Monday that Labor would take a holistic approach to working with the sector . <p> " Whereas the Coalition tends to lump charities within the social services portfolio , Labor recognises that social services charities are just one of the many kinds of charities , " Leigh said . <p> " We 're keen to take a holistic approach to charities . " <p> He said that his focus in the new role would be supporting the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) . <p> " Last term was all about saving the charities commission , the charities commission was in some sense the main game for charities because the sector had fought for so long to have a one-stop regulator , " he said . <p> " Now it 's much more about making sure the charities commission works as well as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage them to cede powers to the charities commission and also to make sure that the charities commission has the resources it needs to really service the sector . " <p> In March the federal government decided to keep the ACNC after two years of speculation about its future . Leigh said he hoped the move signalled a new era of the Coalition 's approach to the sector . <p> " I hope that the government 's decision to end its war on the charities commission does signal a more positive approach , " he said . <p> " I hope that they will move away from the temptation to put gag clauses in contracts , which is something that has taken away a valuable advocacy role that charities have played , but really that 's up to the government as to how constructive they 're willing to be with our great charity sector . " <p> While Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull made few changes to his cabinet , he made Zed Seselja the assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs . Seselja previously said the government needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said he looked forward to working with the sector . <p> " I 'm keen to begin conversations with a range of different charities across Australia , basically to provide an opportunity for successful charities to learn from one another , " he said . <p> " I think there 's a lot of shared wisdom in the sector and it 's about trying to make sure we bring together those conversations . " <p> He said the other main focus of his role would be addressing the decline in civic engagement . <p> " One big challenge is that civic engagement , social capital in Australia has declined in many measures over the course of the last 50 years , " he said . <p> " We 've seen fewer Australians joining formal groups , being active in volunteering , being willing to engage in activities such as organised sport . And so I think there 's a conversation to be had about what successful charities can learn from one another about how to turn around that problem . <p> " The decline in civic engagement was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Now as shadow minister for charities , I 'm less interested in the academic evidence about what 's happened and more interested in the practical challenge of how we turn it around . " <p> Leigh , who also retained his position of shadow assistant treasurer and picked up the roles of competition and productivity , and trade in services , said he was the right person for the position of shadow charities minister . <p> " Certainly for the last three years I 've had primary responsibility for the charities commission , and I 've been doing that over the last three years , " he said . <p> " But also I think having written Disconnected I 've got a window into the challenges that our charities face , and a real passion to try to make a difference . <p> " This is n't necessarily an ideological challenge , but it 's one that really matters for Australia because the more people we have donating , volunteering , giving their time and energy to our charitable sector , the stronger a country we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leigh , who is a non-factional independent , took a $40,000 pay cut from $230,000 to $190,000 because Shorten 's expanded shadow ministry of 32 members is beyond the number allowed to be paid . <p> But Leigh said he was n't fazed by the pay cut . <p> " I do n't think anyone ought to be worrying about whether a politician is in the top 1 per cent or top 2 per cent of the income distribution , " he said . <p> " The face is inequalities widened a lot over the last generation , and those of us at the top are doing just fine . <p> " But there 's a lot of Australians who are struggling to get by , who 've seen their incomes fall , who are homeless , who are really living in vulnerable circumstances , and it 's them we should devote our energies to .

 Pays <p> By Antony McMullen , <p> new investment coming through , cooperative and other forms of entrepreneurship in Australia could provide a vehicle for ex-offenders in the criminal justice system to be part of the solution to reducing harmful criminal activity , writes cooperatives expert Antony McMullen . <p> In an Australian first , the New South Wales Government will target prisoner reoffending through a new impact investment ( see Pro Bono Australia 's article New Impact Investment Targets Prisoner Reoffending ) . This is a positive public policy move and contrasts with the usual " law and order auction " that results in harsher sentencing and prison being only seen through the prism of punishment . Research tells us that longer sentences and time inside do not act as a crime deterrent . <p> Apart from reducing real harm in community there is money to be saved . It costs around $74,000 per annum ( or about $200 a day ) to incarcerate a prisoner . Costs particularly spiral when prison becomes a revolving door . According to the Saturday Age the Victorian recidivism ( repeat-offending ) rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low of 34 per cent four years previous . This is where social impact bonds come in through investing in rehabilitation rather than more prison beds . <p> Evaluating the World 's First Social Impact Bond ( Rand Corporation ) <p> It works like this . Through a contractual arrangement an enterprise or organisation delivers a social program to reduce , for example , repeat-offending . The program is funded through securing private investment ( social impact bonds ) ; if the government saves money due to the program or initiative achieving positive social outcomes ( remember each prisoner costs $200 a day and that is not counting all other costs of harm to the community ) then some of this is returned to the investor . <p> The first social impact bond issue in the UK was designed along these lines . Comprehensive services were provided to ex-offenders " at the prison gate " to reduce the likelihood of reoffending . However it appears that although valuable learning was undertaken and some progress was made , the initiative failed to hit a crucial target to trigger repayments . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possible reasons may be that the social impact bond contractual model involved six types of relationships ( 11 each governed by a separate contract ) which appears quite complex ; and , practically , most ex-offenders disengaged from the rehabilitative services well before the expiry of their 12 months of available support . The designers of the NSW initiative will have learnt from the evaluation of this program . <p> For effective rehabilitation of ex-offenders the late and revered Fr John Brosnan summed it up well when he said what 's needed are " friends you can trust , a good home and a job you can handle " . When it comes to a job you can handle , there is a strong correlation between people who are unemployed and people who have a criminal record ; but , on the other hand securing employment contributes to discontinuation of criminal activity . The law says that a business can not refuse to employ someone on the basis of their criminal record unless it would clearly stop them from being able to do the job . However , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers would at least be nervous about employing someone with a criminal record , even if it 's petty in nature . <p> A direct way to make change could be to consider the co-operative alternative as pioneered in Puerto Rico ( and other places like Italy ) . Recidivism rates in Puerto Rico have been cut by more than 80 per cent for those participating in the world 's first **28;423;TOOLONG cooperative , Cooperativa de Servicios . Remarkably , only six percent of graduates of the program have been rearrested in the past 10 years . Cooperative projects range from everything from making children 's clothing to pioneering renewable energy products ; these projects start in prison and can continue outside . <p> We know that greater levels of inequality contribute to the level of crime in a society . With a more diverse economy , including distributed employee ownership through co-operative and other forms of partnerships , there is opportunity for greater sharing of economic development and reward ( including in some cases business profit-sharing ) . <p> Most importantly , it can lead to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated : " We 've learned how to run a business , and some former inmates now have their own small businesses outside as a result if you can change the way people think in prison , you can do anything . It is a model for social change . " <p> In Australia , the most prevalent criminal offences involve Illicit drugs with 13 per cent of these offenders being charged with dealing and trafficking and 8 per cent with manufacture or cultivation . Imagine the ' business skills ' people learn in the black economy being put to use in new and positive ways . <p> Another ex-offender in another US-based program ( Prison Entrepreneurship Program ( PEP ) in Texas ) put it this way : " I 've always had entrepreneurial skills , I just used them in bad ways I knew all about profit margins and managing people . " <p> In Victoria we have an unemployment rate of about 5.7 per cent and employment growth is primarily in part-time work that can be precarious in nature . To stay out of jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurship and this needs investment , whether it be social impact bonds or investing in co-operative startups . <p> About the author : Antony McMullen is a cooperatives expert who works for Employee Ownership Australia and undertakes policy work for the Catholic and Uniting denominations in areas such as prison reform .

 of Corporate Sustainability <p> By Laura Reed , <p> Strategic adviser Laura Reed reflects on what it takes to work within an in-house sustainability team in a large business and being brave tops her list . <p> I recently had a conversation with a peer who has started in an in-house corporate sustainability role . They wanted to talk about how to inject some fresh energy into their organisation 's journey around sustainability . <p> How do you get things moving ? We talked about vision , then building and embedding a strategy . Would n't that be stepping on other people 's toes ? Yes , it will involve this ! Where should the sustainability team sit within a business ? As close to strategy , risk and corporate affairs as possible . <p> Inspired by that conversation , what follows are reflections from working within three in-house sustainability teams in large businesses and now consulting to a range of organisations on their journeys . <p> Be brave and realistic <p> Being in an in-house sustainability role requires a certain amount of bravery . You are the odd one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target . You are an intrapreneur trying to change things , to minimise harm and create positive impact . This will mean you 'll ruffle feathers and probably upset a few people along the way , so you need to be brave ! <p> But remember you do work for a business , and what you do has to be realistic , it has to have a business case that links back to and supports the business ' vision and core work . In the beginning it 's fine to admit that you 're at the beginning , you can build iteratively and work towards more aspirational goals . In time , your work can even generate savings for the organisation or create new forms of value and this is when things really get exciting ! For more on this idea see : Shared Value . <p> Build a business case <p> To get started you 're going to need a business case , this comes even before you start your strategy . Ask yourself why does it make sense for my business to invest in sustainability and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some inspiration . <p> Engage , engage , engage <p> Cultivate relationships at all levels of the business and have lots of coffees . Try to find the other people like you , the other " intrapreneurs " also trying to move the agenda forward . You often find these people at the front line the people delivering the program , managing the operations or working with the customers . Ask them about their work and how they see it linking back to environmental or social impact . Try mapping your stakeholders and be methodical in reaching out across the business . <p> Then you need a senior champion to back your work , do some research and find out which leaders in your business are likely to be supporters , then take them a compelling business case and use their influence to open doors for your agenda . <p> Connect the dots and communicate <p> Far too often , especially in large organisations , there 's already a lot going on that serves a sustainability agenda it 's just happening all over the place and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a whole lot of noise : community , diversity and inclusion , environment , sustainable supply chain , Indigenous it 's all sustainability and can be pulled together by developing clear focus areas , a strategy and targeted communications . <p> Become the person that knows what 's going on across the business and connect the dots bring people together , facilitate conversations . Help to build and communicate a vision for the business centered around sustainability . And do n't forget about communicating more broadly across the organisation too . Build your narrative and your storytelling skills . Here 's one great organisation that can help : Digital Storytellers . <p> Governance is n't sexy , but really important <p> Next you 'll need a governance structure to support your work . Even in a smaller organisation governance will ensure that your strategy becomes more than a pretty diagram on your website . Ideally you want your strategy to be public ( so even if the leaders change , the work keeps going ) and to have clear targets against which you can measure performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , and have senior leaders sign up to the delivery of the programs of work in your strategy and be accountable for measuring performance and pushing to reach targets . For more on this idea , start by reading this . <p> Find a support crew <p> And finally , find a support network outside of work to compare notes , share wins and losses and bounce ideas off . Look for others in your industry or across sectors who are on the same journey ideally mix with those who are just getting started and some who are further down the track . A great leadership and networking program to consider is offered by the Centre for Sustainability Leadership . <p> About the author : Laura Reed is a strategic advisor at Spark Strategy . She 's passionate about finding ways to deliver both business value and social impact through partnerships , especially between corporates and Not for Profits . She has experience in sustainability strategy and reporting , social impact measurement , community engagement , and the design and delivery of shared value projects .

 Sort Out NDIS ' IT Debacle ' <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> The federal government is once again being called on to urgently step in and sort out " the IT debacle hampering the National Disability Insurance Scheme " as some providers claim they are being forced to suspend their services . <p> Dignity for Disability MLC Kelly Vincent is demanding that Social Services Minister Christian Porter " urgently intervenes " as she claims many service providers , agencies and self-managed clients have been unable to access the new payment portal , which allows NDIS participants to claim against their funding packages to pay for their services . <p> Moreover , according to Vincent , no NDIS plans have been approved since before the NDIS was rolled out nationally on 1 July . <p> Vincent , who was elected to South Australia 's upper house in 2010 , told Pro Bono Australia News that " enough was enough " . <p> " I demand that the Commonwealth social services minister take action to march out of this mess . We are out of caretaker election mode , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix this fiasco , now , " Vincent said . <p> " Clearly , the NDIA are not getting the support they need to clean up this chaos they need an urgent investigation and injection of resources guaranteed by the minister in charge of the NDIS , the Hon. Christian Porter MP . <p> " I have been told that not only external users are having a hell of a time with the new computer system , but it seems National Disability Insurance Agency staff ca n't approve plans following the recently-implemented IT changes . <p> " I am also getting calls from families that have now been abandoned by service providers because those providers have n't been paid for six weeks . Bureaucratic bungling is crushing small businesses through administrative mayhem . <p> " It is very tough to ask yourself and your staff to go six weeks without pay . <p> " We are starting to see a very tangible negative impact on people with disabilities ... because it their funding is stuck in the system under this website meltdown . " <p> Her calls have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of My Therapy House . <p> In an official ministerial complaint addressed to Vincent , Porter , Assistant Minister for Disability Services Jane Prentice , Shadow Minister for Disability Reform Jenny Macklin , and Senator Nick Xenophon , Baltutis said she had received minimal assistance from the NDIA and the problems were forcing them to consider closing the practice . <p> " Currently we have over $11,000 of outstanding invoices that we have not been able to reconcile for NDIS managed clients , " Baltutis said . <p> " We have 11 clients ( and more emerging each day ) who can not access their NDIS portal ... as a consequence our practice , My Therapy House in South Australia does not have accurate information about client service plans , goals or funding on our MyPlace Provider Portal , is not able to book in services for clients on the NDIS MyPlace provider portal and is not able to guarantee that we can sustain services to clients if we do not know what their unused fund amounts are . <p> " We hope you are able to address these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our clients , as well as our practice . <p> " We want to continue servicing our current client group and not be put in a position of cancelling services to NDIS managed clients , who we have served for the last 12 months ( and longer ) , or closing the doors of our practice because it is no longer viable to run a business in this way . <p> " We are a small practice and need to pay our employees as well as pay our bills . We are accessing the NDIS emergency funding , however we still do not know if our clients will have enough funds allocated to their service plans for the services we provide . We do not want our clients or ourselves to be out of pocket due to issues beyond our control that NDIS have created . " <p> Vincent said , in spite of daily meetings and software updates every night , the new website had not been fixed and still did n't tell a service provider whether a participant had any money available in their plan . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone calls explaining that all the IT problems had been fixed , yet upon logging in on Monday , they 've found it 's as faulty as it ever was , " Vincent said . <p> " So it seems very interesting that the view of the agency seems a bit out of step with the reality at the moment . <p> " What is even more concerning ... it has now been six weeks since a participant was approved for a plan under the NDIS so they are actually at the point where they can not accept new people on to the scheme presumably because of this IT debacle . <p> " It 's just not acceptable . " <p> Vincent said the current situation threatened to undermine the NDIS as a whole . <p> " I think it is completely fair to assume that this may well impact people 's confidence in the scheme as a whole ... 1 July was supposed to be the start of the full rollout of the scheme and yet what has really happened is the brakes have quite literally been put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " So on the one hand we 've been told that 1 July is the date when people with disabilities can really start hoping for better lives and more supports and yet the exact opposite has happened . <p> " If this does n't get sorted out very quickly my concern is it could severely undermine people 's confidence in the scheme and therefore the success of the scheme as a whole and given that this is such an important investment in letting people have quality of life and achieve their goals , who might have gone without that necessary support , or been under-supported for many years if not decades , we ca n't afford to have the scheme sabotage itself when we are already fighting so hard to show the Australian society at large what an important reform this is , so there are already enough detractors without the scheme imploding on itself . " <p> Vincent said the social services minister was responsible for the NDIS and the welfare of people with disability . <p> " He ca n't sit idly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already gone on for a month and a half now where people have gone without basic services , everything potentially from being able to have the support to get up and have a shower and get dressed in the morning to psychology , to physiotherapy and occupational therapy and so on ... that 's why Dignity for Disability calls on him to take urgent action to rectify this and to make sure that those who ca n't access their funds in the meantime are given emergency supports such that they can continue to access their vital support services . " <p> Christian Porter 's office and the office of Assistant Minister for Disability Services Jane Prentice , who is currently responsible for the operational side of the NDIS , referred Pro Bono Australia News to a statement from the NDIA . <p> The statement said : " Suggestions that the National Disability Insurance Agency ( NDIA ) does not have sufficient resources to successfully implement the transition and is not approving plans are incorrect . <p> " Since 1 July the NDIA has continued to deliver the scheme with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to providers and self-managed participants <p> hundreds of plan approvals and reviews finalised <p> almost 7,000 people granted access to the Scheme <p> almost 4,000 people in the NDIS planning process . <p> " The NDIA has and continues to acknowledge that during this major transition there have been some issues relating to data migration from the old to new platform . <p> " These issues have impacted on payment requests being able to be successfully processed within the new NDIS myplace portal . <p> " Throughout July a range of these issues have been progressively fixed , resulting in the progression of individual claims . <p> " The agency has already successfully transitioned 30,000 Australians into the NDIS , on time and on budget with a participant satisfaction rating of more than 90 per cent . <p> " The agency has and will continue to work with providers and self-managed participants to ensure they are financially supported and will continue to communicate directly with providers and self-managed participants who have been impacted , through our regional staff and call centre . <p> " There is no reason why any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments continue to be available to providers and self-managed participants experiencing financial impact . " <h> Post Comment <h> One Comment <p> Sadly , the IT consultancies that do this sort of thing again and again make more money from a failed implementation than a successful one . For some reason they never make the news either so senior management with no IT knowledge get suckered time and time again .

 of Exercise a Day Could Offset the Risks of Modern Life <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Working in an office is as bad for you as smoking but just one hour of exercise a day could help combat the fatal risks of modern life , according to new research . <p> A study of more than one million adults from the USA , Western Europe and Australia , published in leading medical journal The Lancet , revealed that sitting at a desk for eight hours a day could increase the risk of premature death by up to 60 per cent . <p> Researches claim that sedentary lifestyles are now posing as great a threat to public health as smoking and causing more deaths than obesity with physical inactivity linked to an increased risk of heart disease , diabetes and some cancers . <p> However , doing at least one hour of physical activity per day , such as brisk walking or cycling , could eliminate the increased risk of death . <p> Lead author Professor Ulf Ekelund , from the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences and the University of Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been a lot of concern about the health risks associated with today 's more sedentary lifestyles , " Ekelund said . <p> " Our message is a positive one : it is possible to reduce -- or even eliminate these risks if we are active enough , even without having to take up sports or go to the gym . " <p> The study , which forms part of a new four-paper series , calls on people spending long periods of time at their desk to change their routine and take a five minute break every hour as well as exercise at lunchtimes and evenings . <p> The authors of the series warn there has been too little progress in tackling the global pandemic of physical inactivity since a previous study was launched ahead of the 2012 Olympics , with one-quarter of adults worldwide still failing to meet current recommendations on physical activity . <p> WHO guidelines recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week much lower than the 60 to 75 minutes per day identified in this analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an average age of 45 , into four equally sized groups according to how active they were less than five minutes a day for the least active , and up to 60 to 75 minutes a day for the most active . <p> They found the typical modern lifestyle of spending a day in front of a computer , followed by an evening in front of the television was proving fatal with watching TV for more than three hours per day associated with an increased risk of death . <p> Ekelund stressed the importance of fitting exercise into the day . <p> " For many people who commute to work and have office-based jobs , there is no way to escape sitting for prolonged periods of time , " he said . <p> " For these people in particular , we can not stress enough the importance of getting exercise , whether it 's getting out for a walk at lunchtime , going for a run in the morning or cycling to work . <p> " An hour of physical activity per day is the ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some exercise each day can help reduce the risk .

It 's exciting to see this come to fruition , achieving real bricks and mortar results .

" <p> " It is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusive homes and stops them making the final decision , " she said . <p> " Risking homelessness with your children is a massive decision to take . <p> " Knowing that if you break it off with your partner you wo n't be able to necessarily afford the rent or the mortgage or be entitled to even stay at the property if you perceive it as his house is a really massive thing . <p> " And then having left , that 's not too bad for a brief period , but you really ca n't have the children settle in school or you ca n't be near your own GP , there are just so many things that you ca n't do when you have n't got a stable place that you know is yours . <p> " So it 's both a reason that women do n't leave and it makes it very hard after they have , and that really impacts safety . If you 're making these tough decisions to stay in situations that are n't safe but you are fearing the worst for losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take , as women in Australia now . " <p> Holst said they had seen a significant rise in the number of women and dependent children approaching their services for housing and support in an attempt to escape a violent and abusive home . <p> " In the last year alone 60 per cent of our clients were women and children fleeing family violence , " Holst said . <p> " Many of the women who come to our service looking for a way out of an abusive relationship have a really hard time accessing public or community housing and private rental during a time of great emotional upheaval . <p> " I think the tighter the housing market is , the more it is a factor . " <p> She said the longer a woman and her children remained in housing crisis the trauma and suffering they endured was prolonged . <p> " We know that family violence has a devastating impact on the lives of the women and children who experience it , " she said . <p> " If you add to that the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense that you are going to be able to get your life back together quickly the trauma increases . " <p> Holst said the Andrew 's government was on track to deliver strong policy and funding outcomes . <p> " This is the sort of leadership that can have a significant and enduring impact on one of the biggest social and community concerns we are dealing with in Victoria and nationally , " she said . <p> " Housing is one of a broad range of issues covered by the royal commission but it really is one of the first things we need to sort out for women and children at risk . " <p> It comes as Labor has called on the federal government to appoint a minister for housing and homelessness . <p> The shadow minister for housing and homelessness , Doug Cameron , said Homelessness Week highlighted the federal government 's " failure to tackle homelessness " . <p> " This week is Homelessness Week . It is a week during which every one of us should pause and reflect on the fact that on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home they can call their own , " Cameron said . <p> " Labor believes that safe , affordable housing is a basic human need and a basic human right , the absence of which denies people their human potential and the chance to lead a fulfilling life . <p> " The Turnbull government , like the Abbott government before it , does n't even have a minister for housing and homelessness . <p> " At a time when housing unaffordability is at its worst in living memory , more people than ever are suffering housing stress and homelessness remains unacceptably high , housing is n't even on the government 's radar . <p> " Labor calls on the government to appoint a minister for housing and homelessness with responsibility to reduce the incidence of homelessness in Australia and tackle in a meaningful way the housing affordability crisis that is killing the aspirations of a generation .

 of Carers <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> On Richard 's Side , the final installment in a trilogy of films charting the life of a man with a complex disability , provides a rare insight into the hidden lives of carers as Richard 's parents fight to ensure his quality of life . <p> On Richard 's Side . Deirdre Croft and Richard Rook <p> Pro Bono Australia has partnered with GOOD PITCH ? to shine a light on powerful films that are addressing some of society 's most pressing issues . In the lead up to the GOOD PITCH ? 2016 screening event in November we will be speaking with some of the filmmakers about what inspired them to document these issues . <p> Andrew Wiseman , director of On Richard 's Side , first met Richard 's mother Deirdre Croft in 1989 , and he felt compelled to share her story as a carer . <p> What followed was a trilogy of documentaries that span more than 30 years , with Richard as a 10-year old-boy in Driving with Richard ( 1992 ) , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the latest film explores his parents ' poignant journey to find Richard , 35 , long-term accommodation for when they can no longer care for him . <p> Wiseman spoke to Pro Bono Australia News about the millions of Australian carers who go unnoticed , and his desire to educate people about the impact both exhausting and fulfilling that caring has on their lives . <p> What themes is the documentary exploring ? <p> The process of making the film , On Richard 's Side , which is the third in a trilogy of films , has been one of trying to make observational documentaries . I think it 's always the case that a filmmaker , as much as they try to step lightly through the observational filmmaking process nonetheless has some influence obviously on what is made . <p> But I 've really tried to tell these stories by creating a canvas that provides a story space for the main participants , so I have n't been trying to editorialise through the making of the films , and particularly with the third one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear themes that emerge from On Richard 's Side and the first two films . <p> One of the ones that comes to mind for me is the notion that care obviously has to be shared and that it has to be shared across a lifetime . And I 'm talking here in particular about care of someone who has a complex disability , but I think the theme holds for care of people with all sorts of other needs . So given that this film is the third in a trilogy and the trilogy has been made across nearly three decades , I think that theme comes through pretty strongly , or I hope it does . <p> One of the other themes or issues that came home to me in the making of this film , and the previous two films , is that while Richard , who is one of the main participants of the film and who has complex disability , while he is nonverbal and requires a great deal of assistance , he gives to others in many , many ways even as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong themes for me is this notion of reciprocity , that there 's a reciprocal relationship between the carer and the person who 's being cared for . <p> Why did you chose to focus on Richard 's story ? <p> The history of this particular film goes back a long way . I was working in Perth in 1989 in a place called the Film and Television Institute , and it was my brief to assist local filmmakers to get their projects made . And a woman named Deirdre Croft came to see me one day and said that she had a son with a complex disability and she 'd like assistance to make a film about other mothers who had children with similar needs . And after I spoke with Deirdre and met Richard and the rest of the family , I thought that their story was really compelling and I wanted to help to tell their story , so that 's the history of how these projects came together , and we made a film about Richard and Deirdre and some others when Richard turned 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one as he turns 35 , so that 's the history of the project . <p> On Richard 's Side was filmed between early 2014 and towards the end of 2015 , it spans a couple of years there when he turned 35 in one of these years , and what we 're exploring in this third film is Deirdre 's really determined efforts to find long-term accommodation for her son Richard . <p> Deirdre 's now in her early 60s and she 's concerned about what might happen to Richard if she 's no longer capable of caring for him in the way that she has been over the last number of years , and this is a challenge that a lot of people in Deirdre 's position find themselves , so we explore a whole range of things in the third film of the trilogy , but at its centre is this challenge and this determination by Deirdre to continue to create a good life for Richard and to look ahead and see what that good life might look like if she 's no longer around . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 35 years to try to get a sense of the changes in their lives . <p> How significantly has the way society deals with disability changed over the three decades you 've been documenting Richard 's story ? <p> I think that the recent rollout of the NDIS , the National Disability Insurance Scheme , is a really powerful and positive piece of public policy , and I hope works really well , and I think it 's an indication of the underlying decency of Australia as a society . Having said that , I think there are still many challenges in this area of caring and carers and how we look after those or work with or provide choices for people who need extra assistance in life . <p> One of the things that came across to me very clearly in the making of this film , and the previous two films , was just the sheer numbers of people involved . I think there are recent statistics that indicate that about 2.8 million Australians are involved in unpaid care of one form or another , roughly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the specific story that is presented in On Richard 's Side , I think embraces many universal themes and one of those is that many , many Australians are involved in a caring role . <p> So a story like On Richard 's Side does n't actually lie at the margins of Australian society , it 's very much to the fore . So I think there 's a good deal of compassion in Australian society in general , but maybe there is a lack of awareness , a lack of understanding of the scale of the challenges that are faced within Australia . <p> What change or impact are you trying to achieve through this film ? <p> The process of making the film has been really fascinating and very positive . The finance for the production budget has come from a number of sources including Film Australia and Film Victoria , and also through the Good Pitch process , working with the Documentary Australian Foundation and the Shark Island Institute , and that has been just terrific in first of all managing to secure the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent amount of money for our " impact campaign " . And it 's the first time as a filmmaker I 've really had that process , being assisted by philanthropists to support the production budget and then the outreach campaign , and because we have some finances there we can now push the film out quite strongly and hopefully beyond its normal pattern of distribution , but also to target specific groups . <p> And hopefully they can use the film as a tool , as a resource , to do number of things -- to continue to raise awareness about what is required in this area of assisting carers and those with a disability to continue to forge a really good life . And so we hope to do a whole range of things in that area , aided with the finance we 've managed to raise through the Good Pitch process . <p> Is there a lack of awareness about carers ? <p> I think there has been support for people who are in a caring role such as Deirdre , I think the support could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . I think the various networks of carers associations around Australia do really terrific work , but it 's challenging and as in many areas of society funds are limited and probably constrain what they can do and what they would like to do . <p> I think the rollout of the NDIS is a really positive step and I really hope that assists in this area , and I hope that films like On Richard 's Side , working alongside all sorts of other works ... can continue to really raise awareness about these issues and deepen our understanding about the challenges that are involved , and in a film like On Richard 's Side I hope can be used as a resource to assist community groups and businesses both small and large to understand what might be happening with people in their organisations who are in a caring role , how challenging those caring roles are , and to look at what organisations small and large , businesses small and large , educational institutions can do , just to assist to make life easier for carers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side is screening at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 2 and 4 August . <h> Latest News <p> 
 of a Boy <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Zach 's Ceremony is a deeply personal coming-of-age story about a boy caught between two worlds , the city versus the outback , black versus white , and the struggles between a father and a son , but at it 's core it shines a light on the issues of race and identity . <p> Pro Bono Australia has partnered with GOOD PITCH ? to shine a light on powerful films that are addressing some of society 's most pressing issues . In the lead up to the GOOD PITCH ? 2016 screening event in November we will be speaking with some of the filmmakers about what inspired them to document these issues . <p> Aaron Petersen , director of Zach 's Ceremony , invites viewers to submerse themselves in Zach 's world and see it through the eyes of the boy . <p> In the documentary a 13-year-old Zach Doomadgee says : " In Sydney they call me a blackfella , in Doomadgee they call me a whitefella . I do n't know who I am . " <p> The documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles of his teenage years , his attempt to reconnect with his Indigenous roots through the rite of initiation and on the path to find out who he really is . <p> Petersen said he hopes the audience walks away with something from the film and gains a better understanding that Indigenous culture is alive in this country and it should be embraced , no matter the race . <p> He spoke to Pro Bono Australia News about the challenges of a non-Indigenous director making a film about Indigenous issues , how filming transformed him personally , how the documentary fits into a wider debate on race and Indigenous culture , and why he is inviting the newly appointed Northern Territory royal commissioners Mick Gooda and Margaret White to watch the film . <p> Why did you choose to focus on this story ? <p> I guess the story was more presented to me , by Alec Doomadgee , who is Zach 's father . We met about 10 years ago working on a television series together , he was recording voice overs , and in between the sessions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he comes from and the Country in which he lived and grew up on . He then started telling me about his son , Zach . <p> Zach was always going to go through his rite of initiation , and just hearing about the story and the plan and what Zach was facing , also what Alec was facing too as a father , captured my attention straight away . <p> For me personally , I have two Indigenous nephews , and I used to chat to my brother-in-law as to how he was going to bring his boys up and what he was going to teach them , and he was a little lost as to what to do . So it just seemed to feel like a perfect fit , everything kind of aligned . <p> The narrative is very personal but the issues of identity and parental approval are quite universal , were you looking to paint the big picture ? <p> I think early on we did a lot of research into a number of documentaries and a lot of them drew attention to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For us , Alec is first and foremost an activist in the Indigenous space . He works in the media and knows the power of the platform and how to get his message out there , so he wanted to utilise the space to talk about themes that needed addressing . The producer , Sarah Linton , and I concentrated on these once in the edit suite and started piecing together Zach 's life . It was clear how these themes were discussed over the years and how they then affected Zach , it almost directed him down a life path . We steered clear of a political film , pointing and waving the finger at everyone saying how wrong they are , and instead allowed the viewers to submerse themselves in Zach 's world and see it through the eyes of a boy . Therefore , we made it universal , something everybody can relate to and having it told by a child allows how we connect with those themes in a different way . Zach is an incredible storyteller and you feel quite attached to his situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So again , it felt like the right approach to take . We did n't want to create a film that was going to bang people over the head with a message , we just wanted them to learn something at their own pace and let the film address topical issues carefully . At the end of the day , as long as somebody takes something out of the film and walks away wanting to make a change or listen to what was said and how they can adapt it to their everyday life , then that was our goal from the get-go . <p> Look , it 's difficult to be a non-Indigenous director making an Indigenous film and talking about themes that do not directly relate to me , so it was really important I allowed these to be introduced and discussed by Indigenous people , and that is Alec and Zach . <p> We discussed alcohol , especially within Doomadgee itself , because there is a particular law up there called the Alcohol Management Plan which restricts alcohol -- full strength beer , wine and spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a particular law , well I say law , they call it a plan so it is not quite a law but it is still enforced by police , it is a particular law that is only subject to two places in Queensland and one of those places is Doomadgee . <p> Other themes include identity , culture , ceremony and then the rite of initiation itself and how important it is , and how it should be embraced a lot more on the education front . <p> That last one is the big one , Alec believes in that a lot and the way he has always expressed it to me , regarded as the main issue , I now understand it myself . It is creating the belief that culture is alive in this country and it should be embraced , no matter the race . Alec is a strong believer and ... what he teaches people is that culture is alive and you adapt it to the environment in which you live . He always puts it that there is no other race in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they have done it in such a short space of time . Whatever way you do adapt , you embrace it with what you know and then it is about moving forward and never letting go . So that is probably the biggest theme that is going to speak to a lot of people , not only in the Indigenous community , but it 's also going to teach a lot of non-Indigenous the importance of culture and how we should embrace it as a nation , and it should be taught to our upcoming generations and respected . Break down all stereotypes that exist . <p> Some of the events of recent weeks and the media focus on the Don Dale detention facility have drawn attention to some of the underlying racial tensions that exist in modern day Australia , how does this documentary fit into this debate ? <p> We all saw those images last week and we were shocked , but I think this film fits into that wider debate around racial tension and the treatment of Indigenous youth . It 's important to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity to stop kids going down the wrong path and ending up in places like these . If more resources were focused on prevention and education rather than to punish negative behaviour , there would surely be a positive outcome for all . With the film 's impact , we would like to offer parliamentary screenings at a state and federal level and invite the royal commissioners Mick Gooda and Margaret White to watch the film . Perhaps a film such as this could be a useful tool to help drive change and inform their recommendations . <p> Why did you choose to film it over five years ? <p> Initially we started out thinking it was just going to be the initiation ceremony , then I met Zach , we had a chat , and we bonded straight away . From there we formed a really close relationship . That allowed him then to start sharing things with me . Usually , especially being a white guy coming into an Indigenous family , there is going to be reservation but for some reason Zach and I just clicked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to invite me in and share their worlds . What I quickly noticed was how compelling their story was , it was n't black and white on paper , it was incredibly involved . Alec is now married to a non-Indigenous woman , Amy , who is appears in the film , but before then , Alec was raising five kids all on his own . When you see what he achieved and how good all the kids turned out , it was an incredible story from the get go . <p> After a few years of filming , we headed to ceremony up on Country and we were invited to start filming the process . What happened in the lead up to then , was Zach approaching his teenage years so he had all those dramas to deal with . Most of us take it for granted growing up in the city but when you 're moving around a lot and dealing with all the added pressures and expectations , it compounded on him and before he knew it , he was breaking down , completely shutting everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , so once we hit ceremony , it reached a whole new level . From there I had to follow the story until we found a natural ending and that ending was basically Zach coming to terms with who he is and how he was going to , I guess , step out of the shadow of his father and start walking his own path . And that simply resulted in filming for so long . <p> Do you feel personally connected to the story after spending that much time with the family ? <p> Yes , but I think I had my own experience coming from the story . Naturally being in my position of documenting Zach and Alec 's life over the years , I could n't think of anything but their " on camera " . But off camera , I developed with the two off them , and their extended family which was pretty special . Today Alec considers me a brother and his mother considers me a son , and that 's just an example of how close we all became over that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went up there as one person and have since completely transitioned into a far better educated and aware individual . I now understand the struggle and can at least contribute something to the change . And then the flow on effect through to my family and friends , and my greater circle . Seeing how I as an individual taught my family and then they taught their friends , I 've now seen a huge number of people suddenly paying a lot more attention to Indigenous issues and the message behind the film itself and embracing Zach 's story , so it 's been incredible . <p> What impact are you trying to achieve through this film ? <p> Exactly that example I just shared with you . At the beginning of each screening so far , Alec and I stand out the front , introduce the film and have a chat . It 's quite important that Alec talks about the film and the reason and messaging behind it , especially when taking the film on different parts of Country . See Alec is from the Waanyi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of songs and stories are shared in the film , especially around ceremony and Dreamtime . And it 's really important that you not only ask for permission but that you acknowledge the land in which these stories are being shared on , just to pay respects to the people of that area . We start every film in that fashion and I invite audience members to see the world through Zach 's eyes and experience it in a way that they 've probably never seen culture shared before . The feedback that I get from most viewers is that they simply absorb more and learn more with the introduction in mind . <p> Personally for me , I want them to walk away with something new even if it 's just one little thing , whether it 's learning what Country they stand on or what the local language or the people from that country are , that 's the start of respect and acknowledging . Just how you flow on from there is going to be up to the bigger system , which is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to embrace it all and talk to their parents about it . So when you look at the big picture , we hope the film sparks a conversation and people take that little bit away . <p> Do you have a target audience in mind ? <p> It is tough to think who our audience is . When we first showed it to our partners like AIME , we first thought obviously it is an Indigenous themed film so it 's going to be for an Indigenous audience , but we always had the vision that this film is much bigger than that , it is much bigger than the space we were defaulted into . The versatility of our father and son story makes it universal and it can really be taken into any culture , or place around the world . Mothers , fathers , sons , daughters , we can all relate to it because of that family aspect . So we 've seen just from the screenings at Hot Docs in Canada and Sydney Film Festival just how many different types of people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young as 13 or 14 going to the screening with their parents , and then older generations like 60 , 70 , 80 year olds , and it all affects them in completely different ways . <p> I was told a story by a friend . Her daughter watched it , and she was only 13 years old , and being a 13 year old absorbed everything , she learnt so much . She then turned to her mother afterwards and said " why did you raise me to be a racist ? " And naturally the mother was offended but the daughter goes on , " because your generation has completely messed everything up , these people are beautiful and they deserve to be treated as though they are like anybody else , " and this is a 13 year old saying this . And just by having that conversation , the mother started looking at it in a new way . She walked away from the film feeling initially guilty as well , which most people from the white side of Australia do , and walked away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the film , gave her then another angle to analyse and think about what she watched . What we 've found , is that it sits with people for weeks or months afterwards . We get random messages from people saying they experienced something the other day and it made them think about the film , so you get an idea of that penetration through Zach 's experience has allowed people to absorb and listen . <p> We always wanted it to be an international audience to watch the film because taking it overseas it might allow that pressure to come back onto Australians and really analyse what some of the problems are that exist here . As Zach says , " We 're all as equal as everyone else in the world are n't we ? " <p> Zach 's ceremony is screening at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 7 and 9 August . <h> march in

 the New Philanthropy for Family Businesses <p> By Ellie Cooper , Journalist <p> Almost half of family businesses globally are actively engaged in social impact investing as part of their philanthropic portfolio , according to new research . <p> The Family Business Philanthropy Creating Lasting Impact Through Values and Legacy report , released on Tuesday by the EY Global Family Business Center of Excellence , found 44 per cent of owners and managers invest in impact bonds . <p> " Family businesses in our experience are strongly inclined to give back to the community ... the typical method the old days of just get the cheque book out and write dollars has always been a part of it , " Burgess said . <p> " Also , they 've always given back through the businesses through services to communities and sponsorship of local organisations . <p> " So this is the third one -- impact investing .

 in the Census <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Young carers are being called on to " tick the box " in the 2016 census in a bid to better reflect the true number of young carers in Australia . <p> Not for Profit Little Dreamers , one of Australia 's leading organisations for young carers , has launched a social media campaign to raise awareness and help parents and young carers understand they are entitled to funding for the work they do and ensure they tick the correct box on the form . <p> It comes after the 2011 census identified around 115,000 young carers , those 26 years and under who look after a family member at home , however , Carers Victoria identified approximately 420,000 in this category which equates to one in 10 young people . <p> Madeleine Buchner <p> Founder and CEO of Little Dreamers Madeleine Buchner told Pro Bono Australia News the Tick the Box campaign was important as the government needed to understand the actual number of young carers because it is an area that requires a lot more funding . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness about young carers , " Buchner said . <p> " The census is a research tool designed to provide a comprehensive guide to the Australian population . <p> " A lot of the funding decisions come from the census for the government and the quite large difference between the numbers 115,000 in the census compared to 420,000 has a big impact on funding for the sector . <p> " I think also question 49 on the census , is a very weirdly worded question , that a lot of people would n't identify with , so I think it was really important that we kind of pointed out which questions young carers should be ticking to have their voice counted . <p> " By filling out the census correctly the Australian Government will get a better understanding of how big the issue is and then which is our hope allocate sufficient funds to the several hundred thousand young carers . <p> Question 49 -- In the last two weeks did the person spend time providing unpaid care , help or assistance to family members or others because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems related to old age ? <p> " This is important as a many young carers suffer from poor mental health as a direct result of their caring role . The school dropout rates are also alarmingly high with 96 per cent of primary carers between the ages of 15 and 25 reported to drop out of education . " <p> Buchner said the government currently offered 333 bursaries of $3,000 each to help young carers across the country , however in terms of " the actual number of young carers " this falls short . <p> " I 'm sure it 's helping the 333 young carers that are able to achieve the bursary but in the grand scheme of things it is not going to provide fundamental change for these young carers , " she said . <p> " I think that as the government gets to know , just the sheer size of the young carer market ... and the number of issues that are facing young carers , and as we continue to advocate and raise awareness for that , I 'm hoping that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . <p> " Because obviously , as young carers do face mental health challenges , and they do n't finish school , they are costing the government . So they are both saving the government a lot of money because they are taking the caring burden off the government but with the extra mental health challenges they are having , that is actually putting pressure back on the government . So in my opinion if the government was able to help young carers from the beginning you would actually be able to prevent that mental health happening and then in the long run you would theoretically be able to save the government a lot more money . " <p> The campaign , which has been running for four weeks , has been showcasing the stories of young carers in an effort to highlight what it 's really like to be a young carer and encourage others to acknowledge themselves as a young carer . <p> Buchner , who is a young carer for her mother and her brother , Charlie , said the stories have touched a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really had a ' normal ' family , and I say that with the quotation marks around it , there was never really routine , one minute Charlie and mum could be quite healthy and the next minute both of them could be in hospital , and I struggled a lot growing up . I did n't really have many friends who understood what I was going through and no one I could vent to I guess , and I think looking back on everything now , I have anxiety and that has definitely come from being a young carer , " she said . <p> " I think the statistic is two out of three young carers have a mental illness and it is usually anxiety or depression , which is quite self explanatory when you look at the lack of routine and the lack of ability to sort of take time out for yourself , but growing up , I 've got a lot of friends now who just happen to be young carers , we just found each other at university and post-university I guess and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social network has been incredible for me . <p> " We 've really seen a lot of people contact us with this campaign saying ' wow , I did n't realise that that classified me as a young carer , and ... since watching this person 's story I 've realised that my role is actually coming under the term young carer , and I think that another part of our campaign has really been to raise awareness and make it ok for people to identify with being a young carer . <p> " Once you identify with that term , there is a lot of extra support that you can access . <p> " But there is definitely a lot of young carers who do n't identify . I think the Australian Child Wellbeing Project said that out of the number of kids that they surveyed that identifies having a family member with a health concern , 60 per cent of them did not identify with being a young carer . " <p> Buchner said another limitation with the census related to under 15 year olds who were excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young carers on a daily basis and we know that the majority fall within the 10 to 14 year-old age group . They should n't be ignored but the census is not structured to capture the correct data , " Buchner said . <p> " What this means -- as in what happened in 2011 is that the number of young carers is grossly under-estimated . <p> " That is something that we will be advocating for in the next census , is to actually change that question so the young carer question comes in before under 15 year olds have to stop filling it out , but definitely we 've been advocating for over 15 year old to 100 per cent tick that box . <p> " I think it comes down to the more we get young people to acknowledge that they are a young carer through social media and through connecting with organisations like Little Dreamers , the more we can go to the government and say , ' Hey , you need to do something more to support these young people ' .

 NFPs Should n't be a Game of ' Moving Statues ' <p> By Oliver May , <p> Opinion : Why do Not for Profit boards need to get proactive about the risk of fraud , writes author and global fraud expert Oliver May . <p> A few years ago , I met a director of a major Australian charity to discuss their counter-fraud framework . Over coffee , she laid out a sheaf of documents on the table . There was a response plan , an investigation manual , policies , procedures it all looked great . I asked her how many cases they had . " None , " she replied . <p> The story is the same with most charities , Not for Profits and NGOs with whom I engage , whether they 're in Australia or elsewhere . They do n't detect much fraud . And this is where many boards stop no fraud is good news . The standpoint of these boards is fundamentally reactive . <p> The problem is that fraud and corruption hide and masquerade . The absence of detection does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old schoolyard game " moving statues " , where the child who is " it " stands with her back to the other kids as they race towards her . When she turns to face them , the kids have to freeze any kids still moving are out . As soon as a board 's focus turns away from fraud , the yard is clear for fraudsters to move . <p> In fact , the risk of fraud in Not for Profits especially from their own staff and volunteers may be considerably higher than many think . My book outlines some of the factors elevating that risk : cultures of trust , operational stretch and the dynamism created by variable funding all play a role . When we unpack factors like these , together with contemporary research a recent study , for example , estimates the loss to fraud in the UK charity sector at 2.5 per cent of its income then that lack of detection looks less encouraging . <p> In this context , detection should be less alarming than non-detection , and failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of the need for a change in approach from reactive to proactive . If fraud tries to hide , then boards need to give chase . And there are some exciting techniques out there -- perception-based data ( such as anonymous staff surveys ) and representative sampling can help to show us where the vulnerabilities might be . Benchmarking , sector forums and research can also inform that analysis . The key is for boards to adopt a " holistic " model to tackling fraud . <p> A holistic model means that we do not just rely on preventative procedures and reactive investigations . It means that we place detection activities ( such as reliable whistleblower mechanisms , information-sharing agreements and proactive examinations ) within a coherent framework : including work to deter , prevent and respond to fraud , underpinned by enabling activities ( such as leadership and communication ) , sited within organisational cultural development and a framework of strategic management . If this sounds expensive , it should n't -- these components are scalable . A Not for Profit needs work to develop its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that work just looks different . <p> Taking a proactive approach puts us in a better position to build donor and public confidence . The crash in public trust exhibited in the UK 's charity sector should tell us that public confidence can not be taken for granted and is vulnerable to scandal . Research shows a rising focus on fraud and corruption stories in the media . <p> But considering reputational risk only when we have detected a fraud is a mistake . Actually , to truly reduce reputational risk , our effort needs to be deployed much earlier on both lowering the likelihood of those scandals , and enabling us to reassure our supporters that we do so . The reputational risk we need to think about is the risk of being unable to articulate meaningful effort to deter , prevent , detect and respond to fraud and corruption . <p> A proactive approach , also , of course , means unlocking a range of immediate benefits . Although the reduction of loss means greater resources for our programs , there are others too . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often concomitant with improved programme quality , while showing our staff and volunteers that we take fraud seriously improves their confidence in us arguably improving productivity . <p> In 2014 , the professional services firm BDO conducted a survey of the Australian Not for Profit sector , finding that although 90 per cent of respondents considered fraud to be a problem for the sector , only about one-quarter considered it to be a problem for their organisations . Perhaps it is time for the remaining three-quarters to turn round , look more closely for those " moving statues " and reap the benefits of challenging them .@@13756056 <h> Transmission pricing impasse 
 distribution is not only unequal , it 's faring worse than other OECD countries write social historian Christopher Sheil and emeritus professor of political economics Frank Stilwell , in this article which first appeared in The Conversation . <p> Australians often pride themselves on living in the land of the " fair go " . However , the available evidence shows the distribution of wealth in this country is no more egalitarian than the average for the OECD countries . <p> In fact , depending on how wealth is measured , Australia may have above average inequality in wealth distribution . <p> Most think of inequality in terms of income differences between rich and poor people . But even more fundamental are the differences in the value of the assets that people own . It is the presence ( or absence ) of this accumulated wealth that determines people 's social position and their opportunities in life ; who gets what depends substantially on who owns what . <p> Until recently , we have known very little about wealth inequalities . The last official national census of wealth in Australia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evatt Foundation marshals the existing evidence on wealth in Australia . <p> As you would expect , Australia as a whole has become much wealthier since 1970 : the total stock of capital has grown twice as fast as national income during the decades since then . <p> But what is more striking is the marked increase in wealth inequality over the same time . We have become collectively richer but much more unequal . <p> A reasonable estimate is that , currently , the poorest 40 per cent of Australian households effectively have no wealth at all : about half of them actually have negative net wealth because of their personal debts . At the opposite pole , the wealthiest 10 per cent have more than half the nation 's total household wealth . The top 1 per cent alone have at least 15 per cent of the total wealth . <p> This affluent elite is getting cumulatively richer not only when compared with poor households but also , significantly , relative to the middle 50 per cent of households . <p> Two faultlines are widening . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other is between the top 10 per cent and the 50 per cent in the middle . The latter division is ultimately explosive , since it indicates that the broad Australian middle class is getting a shrinking share of the fruits of economic progress . <p> How does Australia measure up internationally ? <p> Compared with the 16 other OECD countries for which comparable data exists , Australia looks slightly more egalitarian than average if all forms of wealth are included . <p> However , this is largely because of ownership of household durables , such as clothing , furniture , appliances and cars . The household durables represent 12 per cent of our wealth compared with the OECD average of 7.7 per cent . <p> There are many reasons why durables should be excluded to improve comparability . The national accounts , for example , excludes durables from the aggregate household balance sheet . Piketty 's analysis also excludes durables . Australia 's HILDA survey excludes all durables except cars . <p> The Evatt Foundation report shows that if we also exclude durables from the OECD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households own about the same wealth share as their counterparts in France , Norway and Canada . The only rich countries that are clearly less egalitarian than Australia are Austria , the Netherlands , Germany and the US . <p> What does this mean for politicians ? <p> Ultimately , the case for Australian egalitarian exceptionalism is weak . Australia is not more equal than most other comparable rich countries , and its wealth inequality is growing . <p> Dealing with this situation is perhaps the biggest challenge facing our political leaders today , although you might not get this sentiment from the victors ' public statements in the recent election . <p> Other recurrent political economic stresses need attention most obviously , climate change , financial instability and job insecurity . But these challenges are interlinked , and they all need managing in relation to economic inequality . If the policies are not equitable , they will not be sustainable . <p> An emphasis on narrowing wealth inequality needs to be present in all public policies . These range from pensions and superannuation to disability services , housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless this integrated approach is taken , the cherished belief in a " fair go " will be a dwindling feature of life in Australia .

 programs are designed to facilitate a transactional experience where there is an exchange of some type between the volunteer and the participant . A lot of good can come of this approach to volunteering . <p> However , transactional volunteering tends to leave the volunteer mostly unaffected and unengaged . In order to realise the true benefits of employee volunteering , our programs must become transformative . <p> What is transformative volunteering ? <p> Transformative volunteering creates space for participants to reach beyond the immediate contexts and circumstances of themselves and their communities . Instead of simply exchanging time or resources for the reward of making a difference , volunteers are guided to consider their potential to become increasingly pro-social human beings with a greater capacity for empathy . <p> The primary focus of transformative volunteering is the change that occurs in the volunteers themselves . Volunteering programs and activities are designed to invite all participants to " engage in critical reflection on their experiences , which in turn leads to a perspective transformation " . This transformation in an individual 's perspective is necessary to achieve change at the psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteering ? <p> Transactional volunteering is the voluntary giving of one 's time , knowledge , social network , expertise , skills , abilities , experience , knowledge , training , or insight for the benefit of another without any expectation of direct or commensurate compensation . The " reward " is typically the knowledge that one was able to " make a difference " by helping solve a problem or advance a cause . <p> Four reasons to adopt the transformative model <p> Increased levels of affective commitment <p> Employees who are enabled to act pro-socially ( give , volunteer , and otherwise " do good " for their colleagues or communities ) are likely to respond with increased affective commitment to their organisation . In this context , commitment refers to the degree of attachment an individual feels toward the organisation he or she works for . If you 're a manager or the leader of a company , this is something you obsess about . Do my employees want to stay ? Will they stick it out through tough times ? Do they believe in this organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Improved job performance <p> Research indicates that : " volunteering was associated with both volunteer and job meaningfulness , and that the pull of meaningful volunteer work was even stronger when employees had less meaning in their jobs . The results further revealed benefits of volunteering for employers . Volunteering was related to job absorption but not job interference , and it was therefore associated with better job performance . " <p> Competitive hiring position <p> " For recruitment practice , our results suggest that the net effect of leveraging CSR practices in employee recruitment is clearly a positive one from the perspective of a hiring organisation . The majority of our participants about two-thirds of them reported they were more attracted to the employer as a result of its community investment or environmental strategies . " <p> However , the research contains a very distinct and important warning . If the company 's CSR program is seen to be inauthentic or too small ( it is a token effort ) prospective employees will take a negative position towards the company . In those cases where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be better to not use citizenship programs in recruiting efforts . Additionally , community investment programs must be experienced as meaningful and relational . <p> Improved organisational resilience <p> By developing leaders through an experiential process of learning that involves intentional moments of critical reflection and sensemaking , employees in leadership positions acquire the critical skills necessary to contribute to an organisation 's overall resiliency . Transformative Volunteering approaches develop leadership through the cognitive process of learning , modelling a practice of sensemaking and the creation of significance or meaning . <p> Equipped with this experiential knowledge , individuals possess the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the " organisation 's capacity to anticipate , respond and adapt " .

 <p> Opinion : Why is the tag of being a " cost to society " so hard to shake for charities , asks Emma King the CEO of VCOSS on the release of the organisation 's latest research , More Than Charity . <p> The community sector is not a black hole . <p> Forget everything you think you know about community sector charities and Not for Profits . Those loss making " welfare " organisations run by do-good amateurs ? It turns out they 're actually lean , well run and highly professional businesses . <p> For too long community sector NFPs have been tarred with the brush of mediocrity . Money pits . Black holes . <p> The sector has been on a journey over recent years . Once upon a time both the making and the spending of money was frowned upon .

The old adage " you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with a twist . You need to spend money to make a difference . <p> Revenue issues were also addressed . These days , only half of Australia 's community charities receive any government money whatsoever , and , of those , government funds make up only about half of their total income . The rest fund their operations through a mix of membership fees , charges , fundraising , investments , partnerships , tender work and asset sales . That is , good , old-fashion financial management . <p> ( It 's also worth noting that community organisations are thriving in a convoluted regulatory environment that no private enterprise would stomach . Reviews and audits are numerous and often overlap , definitions are n't coordinated , and the opposing hands of government at times seem to operate independently . ) <p> In some respects you 'd expect nothing less . The community sector is not a cottage industry . In Victoria alone , it 's worth nearly $11 billion and employs 135,000 people . That 's more jobs than the state 's mining , automotive manufacturing , media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Australia 's ageing population set to turbocharge demand for " support and care " jobs over the next decade , these numbers will continue to grow strongly . Hundreds of thousands of new jobs will need to be created . And , sadly , the scourges of inequality , poverty and disadvantage show no signs of curing themselves . There 's lot of work to be done . <p> So why , given the sector 's current financial strength and forecast growth , do community organisations still struggle to present themselves as solid investments or partners in enterprise ? <p> Why is the tag of being a " cost to society " so hard to shake ? <p> Part of the answer may lies in a 2010 Productivity Commission report which found many Not for Profit organisations feel poorly understood by the government and general public . The report found just 20 per cent of businesses have a partnership with a Not for Profit organisation . Businesses canvassed said barriers to collaboration included a lack of resources and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mutual misunderstanding must end . Business leaders must stop being wallflowers waiting for somebody to ask them to dance . <p> It 's time they ( and the general public ) took a fresh look at community sector charities and Not for Profits , and realised they 're solid and successful businesses on economic grounds alone , even before the immense social benefits they produce are taken into account . <p> Partnering with a NFPs is more than corporate social responsibility or an exercise in goodwill . It 's smart business . <p> Great things both commercially and socially can be achieved when businesses and the community sector work in lockstep . <p> About the author : Emma King is the CEO of the Victorian Council of Social Service , a state-based peak body for welfare organisations .@@13796824 <h> This picture of 
 Volunteering Felt More Keenly After 40 <p> Volunteering when you are middle aged or elderly can boost your mental and emotional well being , according to a new UK study . <p> However , research from the universities of Southampton and Birmingham found no such association was seen before the age of 40 , suggesting the link may be stronger the older you get . <p> Previous research has highlighted a link between volunteering and improved mental wellbeing , but this is the first time researchers have examined its benefit across different age groups . <p> The new study , published in the journal BMJ Open , examined data from 5,000 households across the UK based on the British Household Panel Survey ( BHPS ) , with questions on volunteering and general health and well being being asked between 1996 and 2008 . <p> Of those surveyed almost one-quarter of those aged 60 to 74 said they volunteered , compared to 17 per cent among the youngest age group . <p> The authors found that overall , when not taking age into account , those who engaged in volunteering regularly appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never volunteered . <p> But when they looked specifically at different age groups they discovered the association between volunteering and wellbeing only became apparent after the age of 40 years . <p> According to the researchers , the findings held true even after taking account of a range of potentially influential factors , including marital status , educational attainment , social class and state of health . <p> " The association between volunteering and mental well being varies at different points in the life course , " the authors wrote . <p> " These findings argue for more efforts to involve middle-aged people to older people in volunteering-related activities . <p> " Volunteering action might provide those groups with greater opportunities for beneficial activities and social contacts , which in turn may have protective effects on health status . <p> " With the ageing of the population , it is imperative to develop effective health promotion for this last third of life , so that those living longer are healthier .

 Humane Resettlement of Manus Asylum Seekers <p> By Wendy Williams , <p> Not for Profits are calling on the Australian Government to resettle refugees and asylum seekers in a " humane and sustainable way " in the wake of news that an agreement has been made to close the Manus Island detention centre . <p> Photo : d13 / Shutterstock <p> Global aid agency Save the Children has said the more than 850 refugees and asylum seekers who have been " left to languish " in the Manus Island detention centre must be afforded " a chance to move on positively with their lives " . <p> It comes after Papua New Guinea 's prime minister Peter O'Neill and Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton met in Port Moresby on Wednesday to agree to close Manus Island detention centre , consistent with the earlier ruling of the PNG Supreme Court . <p> While the two countries confirmed that the Manus Island detention centre will be closed , no detail was given on the future of those being held there ; except to reiterate that Australia would not accept any of the detainees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Ronalds said the latest announcement meant it was now incumbent on the Turnbull government to detail a safe resettlement plan for the refugees and asylum seekers , many of whom have been " living in limbo in the centre for years " . <p> " The Turnbull government must now find a humane and sustainable resettlement pathway for these men , be it in Australia or a safe , developed and appropriate third country that affords them the rights , protections and opportunities required under our international obligations , " Ronalds said . <p> " This resettlement plan must also be extended to the refugees and asylum seekers languishing on Nauru , where the evidence of abuse , self-harm and other threats to the wellbeing of refugee and asylum seeker children and their families has been consistent and telling . <p> " If the Turnbull government does not outline a humane and sustainable resettlement plan , and it continues to arbitrarily punish refugees and asylum seekers with effective indefinite detention , then further tragedy is inevitable .

 Next Generation of Disability Activists <p> By Peter Gibilisco , <p> Opinion : Meritocracy and affirmative action ? Author and disability researcher Dr Peter Gibilisco offers some key ideas for the next generation of disability activists . <p> Meritocracy is a belief that seems to me to still be alive and well in the senior management of disability support . It also seems to drive many aspects of public policy , particularly when appeals are made to " equal opportunity " . <p> Advocates of a meritocratic approach to disability policy are still assuming that the base-line principle should be that people get out of the system what they put into it . That is why they seek to remove any barriers to people with disabilities " putting in " . It is a political vision often articulated in terms of free market principles that wants a future based on merit . <p> Hence " meritocracy " ( rule by those who gain merit ) and is an alternative to aristocracy ( the rule by those who inherit land ) , or more recently to a class-based " luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time . But in 1998 , Michael Young argued in an article titled Meritocracy Revisited , " meritocracy is even worse than aristocracy because it attempts to acquire plus points because it connotes power and privilege as merited rather than born with " . <p> His book in 1958 , titled The Rise of Meritocracy , was a satire ( this means a system based on merit has unforeseen consequences that will eventually make mobility from one place in the social system to another even more restricted ) , and Young has a negative view of " meritocracy " . In recent years he has felt compelled to criticise " new Labor " because of its meritocratic commitment as advocated by the " third way " policies of the Tony Blair Labor government in the UK ( 1998 to 2007 ) . <p> Anthony Giddens , the renowned political academic and Blair supporter argues that any meritocratic form of equity is flawed , creating deep inequalities of outcome that threatens social cohesion . Likewise Roy Hattersley , British Labour Party MP , was of the view that meritocracy only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while condemning the poor to false hopes of individualised social mobility . <p> My argument is that public policy with respect to the involvement of people with disability in " mainstream society " must be as much about " affirmative action " as it is with " equal opportunity " . So what kind of affirmative action am I proposing ? <p> My requirements for affirmative action <p> I am the beneficiary of a higher education system which has been required by law to make room for people with disabilities like myself . But it needs to be remembered that such requirements were put in place in a context where higher education was reoriented , making it compatible with job training for a post-industrial society . A university degree may look like evidence that people with disabilities have been given an " equal opportunity " to compete but when I think about my own life and experience I conclude that for " equal opportunity " to be a reality , " affirmative action " has to be taken to a new level . <p> This will involve a totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? We need universities that will recognise that their mutual obligation to contribute is institutional and is not simply a matter of granting space in courses to individuals . That obligation is not completed merely by granting degrees and then every year thereafter sending out brochures inviting such highly qualified alumni ( including disabled alumni ) to give generously to the university 's noble cause . <p> Such brochures might feature people in wheelchairs dressed up for graduation but my point is that if that is all the university 's " mutual obligation " then it means that they are simply in the game of making disabled graduates into celebrities ! <p> In future , when severely disabled students get as far as I was lucky to get , I hope universities can give space to ensure such graduates can indeed " give back " as part of postdoctoral and ongoing research programs . What I am concerned about is the development of genuine policy for the severely disabled and , in particular , policies that will seek to meet needs that arise from progressive disability . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chronic disease that will severely worsen over time ( it is a progressive disability ) . Where medical treatment is the promotion of the " old motto " that states , " if you do not use it you lose it " , such an ideology has the well-known and acclaimed view that to improve help and improve deteriorating co-ordination medical action is needed to strengthen muscles . <p> Somehow , assistance for those with progressive conditions -- as with an individual with Friedreich 's Ataxia is needed if they are to gain some " elbow room " in life . This is simply to affirm the importance of ongoing medical research not just to keep people alive but to assist in the social and public contributions of people with progressive debilities . <p> So what I 'm trying to articulate is something about the importance of developing a medical research consciousness that will reckon with the need of finding ways to assist in the attainment of work related skills and sustain them , as long as possible for those like myself with Friedreich 's Ataxia and similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own research results , there is no doubt that affirmative action , applied rightly , can deliver appropriate chances for people with severe and progressive disabilities to have a go at life . <p> In my view it is the political economy , driven by a radical free market agenda that is a fundamental source of the problems faced by people with disabilities . The theoretical problem faced by researchers like myself , as we seek to clarify our critique and set forth alternative policy , is to show how the problems faced by people with disabilities are directly related to prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes . <p> The market driven system routinely puts profits before people 's wellbeing and so when employers are faced with " equal opportunity " demands for employment they will characteristically assume that they will have to make room for lowered productivity , higher costs and greater hurdles to workplace efficiency ( when employing severely disabled graduates ) . The point is that a small business may have an owner who is very sympathetic but who will go to the wall if margins are not properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at what is assumed with " affirmative action " legislation . This political and policy approach requires positive steps to be taken to promote and maintain equal employment opportunity for socially defined population groups in terms of gender , disability , age and race whose participation rates are reduced or non-existent due to what might be called -- " structural factors " . Legislation stipulates that active steps be taken to promote equal opportunity . <p> It is not just about compliance with the ( anti-discrimination ) legislation which seeks to eliminate unequal treatment of individuals . The goal of affirmative action is to eliminate disadvantages for which those having to endure discrimination in the workforce and at any workplace that can not be held responsible . Affirmative action programs seek to appeal to an entire polity 's responsibility to counter the impacts of any " structural discrimination " upon socially defined groups . Thus " affirmative action " requires employers to take active steps to provide equal employment opportunities for groups subjected to discrimination in employment . <p> Frank Stilwell and other advocates of affirmative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a redistribution of income . It is about life chances . People with disabilities often experience the contraction of their life chances simply because unjustified stereotypes are not put to the test of truly critical examination . Their life chances are often already diminished and to challenge the stereotype seems to require a change of cosmic proportions . But legally enforceable affirmative action for people with disabilities can mandate that positions be filled by a certain percentage of prospective employees with disabilities . <p> Still , it should be noted that this approach has faced challenges , not only from the private sector and from government , but also from within the disability rights movement itself . There is a deep suspicion that an unanticipated consequence of affirmative action will be the promotion of discriminatory stereotypes and stigmas within the workforce . Are people with disabilities to be hired merely because it is regulated that employers do so ? Can a campaign mandating a " politically correct " attitude root out discriminatory stereotypes ? It is assumed that , in the long run , this legally enforceable political correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal norm . <p> The pragmatic wisdom of Marta Russell concerning the employment of people with disabilities is identified in the following quote ( cited in Hershey 2000 ) : <p> " The elements in the disability movement decided that all we needed was an " equal opportunity " , as opposed to affirmative action to remedy past patterns of discrimination . I think that was a huge mistake . It would definitely be revolutionary to make corporations hire us , and to prevent corporations from firing employees upon disablement . Affirmative action may be only incrementalist reform which admittedly does not solve the question of full employment but it has gotten some results for other minorities . " <p> In other words , Russell identifies the concept of equal opportunity , in terms of its anti-discrimination focus , with the competitive market system , creating a regulated need for " affirmative action " . <p> That is , a person with a disability 's theoretical right to a public accommodation is really no right at all ; it is still dependent upon the employer 's cost-benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate profits and pay the costs involved in making them . The political economic context of free market capitalism , and the promotion of the market by neo-liberal and third way policy , provides a significant obstacle to the implementation of affirmative action policies . <p> A special thanks to Bruce Wearne , for his mastery of editing and helping to tweak my piece and to Christina for her excellence in academic support work . <p> About the author : Dr Peter Gibilisco is an honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne .

She talks about how she is finding her new role and how it compares to other boards , in this month 's Evolving Chair . <p> O'Donnell , who began her working life as a child welfare officer with the Department of Children 's Services in Queensland and at Walston Park Psychiatric Hospital , took up the role at SANE following a six-year tenure as chair of Breast Cancer Network of Australia . <p> She has held a number of senior roles including acting director for the Human Rights Commission , she was the inaugural Legal Ombudsman in Victoria , before returning to Queensland to head three government departments , including Aboriginal Affairs , Fair Trading , and the Arts . In recent times O'Donnell has chaired a number of statutory authority boards . <p> She said she was looking forward to working with the SANE Australia team towards a future where Australians affected by complex mental illnesses have better services , stronger social connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's Evolving Chair she talks about reducing the stigma that surrounds mental health , growing the SANE brand and how to get the best out of your board . <p> What attracted you to SANE 's board ? <p> I used to work in mental health , mental illness sort of scene and I used to be a social worker , and I worked in a big psychiatric institution in Queensland but I also worked in community health services so I had contact with people with mental health issues who lived in the community or who needed to get treatment . And then I suppose the third area that I worked in was in the human rights area , so I worked at the Human Rights Commission in the late eighties and I encountered a number of cases of people lodging discrimination complaints for lack of proper treatment , that sort of thing , of feeling discriminated because of their mental illness . <p> So it 's always stayed with me , an interest in mental illness and I 'm very interested in the brain and all its complexities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses , unlike say women with breast cancer , which is one of the boards I was on before , there is a lot of stigma attached to mental illness still , a great deal of stigma . Whereas having breast cancer , probably 40 or 50 years ago there was a certain stigma but it 's not so much the case now in this day and age , it 's very acceptable for someone to be quite open about their breast cancer but it 's not the same with someone , particularly with some of the severe and complex mental illnesses , schizophrenia , bipolar etc. and I see that stigma issue as a challenge . <p> I think one of the things that this organisation is trying to do is actually reduce that stigma so that people with mental illnesses can have more rewarding lives . So you are probably picking up , I like a bit of a challenge and I see this area as having lots of challenges , there 's lots we can do . <p> You were recently appointed chair of SANE after six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does it compare ? <p> It is interesting . The first main arcs of the work we do are very similar , interestingly . They are both health focused Not for Profit organisations . They both have a comparative service delivery , they both have needs to fundraise to supplement their income . Because they get some government money but basically you have got to get out there into the community to bring money in to help support the work of the organisation . They both are keen on advocacy , that is either speaking to governments and speaking to the health professionals and trying to get better deals for our clients . Also they both very much focus on the community around the person with the illness , so in SANE it 's the family and friends of the person with the mental illness , in breast cancer it was the spouse and kids and family of women experiencing breast cancer . <p> So there is a lot of similarity . I suppose the differences , which are interesting , is we had a lot more women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it was very much predominately women board members . At one stage , I 'm not quite sure what it is now , more than half of the board members had had breast cancer , including myself as chair , and that was something we looked for . If all else was equal and we had somebody who looked a very promising board member we would look for someone who either had had breast cancer , or in the case of our two men that we had on , one was a surgeon oncologist and the other , his wife had experienced breast cancer and he was a senior partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers . <p> So , pretty much everyone on that board had a connection with breast cancer , a very close connection , whereas with SANE , there are a number of us like me who have got family members who have had various , serious issues in relation to mental health , but I 've never been say a carer or really up close and personal in the way that I was in the Breast Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have a person on our SANE board who has , what we call lived experience of mental illness as a board contributor . So the core positions are similar , the gender spread , there are more blokes on the SANE board , and of course the clientele for SANE is much more spread across both genders , whereas Breast Cancer was very much female , although men do experience breast cancer , they do so in very small percentages . But look , both national boards , both wanting a spread of skills and expertise and some geographic spread , I am in Brisbane , we 've got a couple of board members from Sydney , some from Melbourne , one from regional Australia , currently one from Perth , and similar also to Breast Cancer . So if you are going to be a national organisation I think if you can you should try and get a spread and not just have yourself located either in the Sydney or Melbourne sort of apex . <p> What is the structure of SANE 's board ? <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on for quite some time , as I said , most of them have a strong connection with a lived experience , so there 's a couple of people who have close family members . As you know Anne Deveson who founded SANE 30 years ago , it 's our 30th anniversary this year , she had a son who had schizophrenia and ... he committed suicide , and after he died she set up Schizophrenia Australia , which has then sort of morphed into SANE Australia . <p> So I think we seem to have attracted , particularly men in the business area , who are able to provide some governance guidance and also help with their networks to get some funding for us but who also have a very close association with the lived experience of mental illness , so we have a couple of them . As I said we have a GP who sees quite a lot of her patients come across her desk and then she has to refer on , people with mental illnesses . We 've got a sort of consultant / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who is very well networked and knows a lot about governance , because I think we also need people who know how to help CEOs run organisations and who will mark sort of all the governments requirements because we are of course registered with the ACNC and we have various compliance obligations to meet . <p> We 've got a guy , Colin , who is the chair of a carers organisation in Victoria , and that 's a sort of peak organisation of carer groups , who care for people with mental illnesses . And we will always maintain , I think in fact our constitution says that we should endeavour to always maintain , at least one position on the board of someone who has had that experience , and who brings to our deliberations a consideration of the needs of the family and close friends of people with mental illnesses . We have a guy called Jack O'Connell who is our treasurer . I do n't know whether Jack has any personal connections to mental illness but he 's got very good personal connections to running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , chairs the finance and audit committee and is very well connected in the business community and brings very good financial smarts to the organisation as well . <p> What are your board 's current priorities ? <p> There is a couple of them . Again , you have to forgive me , I 'm very new . So I do n't want to preempt too much except to say it seems that we are looking obviously at growth , sounds like Malcolm Turnbull " jobs and growth " , we 've got a fantastic online forum that is offered to anybody at anytime in Australia , they can go online and chat and talk to other people and get sort of peer support , now we want to grow that . It 's terrific , and it 's doing well but it could be taken up by a lot more people , so some of that relates really to promoting and extending our brand and I would say that would be a real priority . <p> Within the sector we are well known but we do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we would like to , we would like to be as well known as them so that people will use us and make use of the services . So brand growth . Another priority is fundraising . Fundraising in Not for Profit is always a fraught business and it is never settled , if you know what I mean , you have just got to keep thinking creatively , thinking of new ways to raise funds , whether it be through trusts , through philanthropy , through activity , through events , through , if you are really lucky getting some fantastically generous corporate sponsor who might want to partner with us , so we do n't have that latter , we do have a lot of supporters and a lot of individuals who support us but I would say the fundraising , particularly to help us expand and enhance our work would be a key issue . And the other thing I think , is what I mentioned earlier , is processes to do stigma reduction , we send speakers with lived experiences into workplaces and we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who works in your organisation who is experiencing a mental illness , how to look after them and not discriminate against them and part of that is very practical advice , but part of that also is just getting someone who has experienced mental illness to go and talk to workers in an organisation so they can actually see the humanity of somebody who has had a mental illness and not see them as you know , someone who 's not worthy of import or compassion . <p> So I would say stigma reduction is another big focus that we would be doing . And also it is routine , but it is very important for us at the moment , we are really redoing our strategic plan , really trying to focus on what are our major area of difference and what is our point of differentiation with the other mental health services so we can get that right and not duplicate what we 're doing . <p> Absolutely and I do too . This is somewhat of a crowded space . There is a lot of helping services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is phone services , online services , there 's people involved in caring service and there are also other advocacy services that speak to the government when they want some changes etc . It would be crazy , I believe , not to band together when you need to both for particular project but also maybe long term projects or long term collaborations . We are all very supportive of that . I ca n't really discuss it but we are having conversations right now around a possible major collaboration with a very large player in this space . <p> How important is a board 's relationship with the chief executive officer ? <p> It is vital , it is totally vital . I did an Australian Institute of Company Directors course ... and if I did n't know before , I certainly did after doing that course , that one of the keys roles and functions of the board , particularly the chair , is to manage that relationship to provide support and guidance to the CEO and to have a very productive working relationship . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not good or breaks down then you are in deep , deep trouble . So I think that relationship is incredibly important and I think certainly stepping into SANE there is an excellent relationship between the board and the CEO , one of mutual respect and collaboration and help and I see no reason why that wo n't continue . And my preferred style is to stay close to my CEO , have online and phone conversations because we do n't live in the same city , and to catch up between board meetings , with face to face meetings when we possibly can . So it 's a very , very critical relationship , because of course we have to do the performance review of the CEO every year and in this case give feedback about how they 're going and set new targets and goals and that sort of thing with them . So it 's very important . <p> You have offered your expertise to a number of boards during your career , what is the biggest piece of advice you would offer to someone chairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would say two things . You will need to be prepared to really put a lot of time into it . I remember hearing that a good chair puts three times the amount of time into the organisation or to the board and organisation than the other board members , and I think that is probably true , sometimes in my experience and so for example now I think I 'm putting even more than three times that . <p> So , one is , if you 're going to do it , you have got to do it properly , and that involves your time . It involves your time not only in working with the CEO , listening to the CEO , that 's the other thing I think , not being into micromanaging the organisation but taking advice and listening to what the CEO is doing and then reflecting back , or supporting , finding ways to help expedite what the CEO wants to do , obviously within the framework of our own constitution and stuff . <p> So putting the time , working closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your CEO , and I suppose , rolling that around you have got to listen to your other board members , I mean some board members can just , how can I put it , not really contribute as much as they might and sometimes that not their fault necessarily , I think the chair needs to include people and actually speak to every board member , apart from in board meetings , to sort of pull out the best of them to find out , why are you on this board and what is it you think you can offer and can we explore that a bit further , how can we get the best we possibly can out of you . So that would be the advice I would give someone , give the time , work closely with the CEO and enthuse and use your board members to the utmost of their abilities . <h> Intel 's New 
 Together After NDIS Rollout ' Stress ' <p> By Lina Caneva , Editor <p> The Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) Disability Reform Council ( DRC ) has agreed to work more closely with the National Disability Insurance Agency after a report found significant managerial issues in the first two months of the NDIS scheme since 1 July . <p> Social Services Minister Christian Porter released the independent review by PwC into the implementation of the MyPlace portal , after discussing the report and its recommendations with state and territory leaders in Sydney on Friday . <p> The report said : " The NDIA has not implemented a comprehensive Service Delivery Operating Model ( SDOM ) . This has impacted the successful execution of the full scheme launch and put the existing organisational operating model under stress . <p> " Stakeholder engagement , training and preparedness were insufficient , and necessary training materials were not finalised for staff and providers by 29 June 2016 . <p> " It is important to understand that the root cause of payment failure was not a single catastrophic event , but rather a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICT implementation . <p> " The full scheme ICT implementation ran out of time to fully complete the required implementation activities and proceeded with the acceptance of the identified implementation risks with the intention of applying maximum response to the problems . <p> " However , the change effort and overall program was underresourced and underprepared in order to provide the accurate and timely support required by participants and providers when faced with ICT challenges . " <p> He said at the time initial advice from PwC revealed a short-lived technical issue experienced by bulk service providers and an issue around " the adequacy of information " provided to users of the MyPlace payment portal led to errors in inputting necessary information . <p> He said the situation was improving " rapidly and significantly " but there had been a flow on effect . <p> However on Friday Porter said he had discussed the findings with his state and territory colleagues , and the governments will be working closely with the NDIA to help the agency set up the required systems so they do n't encounter similar problems in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no single system failure rather , the frustrating ICT issues arose from a series of compounding events , linked to deficiencies in the NDIA 's governance , operations , change management and communication , " Porter said . <p> " As at 31 August , more than 15,000 people had been deemed eligible for the scheme since 1 July 2016 , with more than 4,000 people in the planning process and more than 1,600 people with approved plans . " <p> Porter said the agreement with COAG for a new national framework for future quality and safeguards was of particular significance and would ensure that people with disability , their families and carers can be assured of a safe and high standard of service delivery . <p> " This framework has been two and a half years in development , so agreement in its final form is a very significant and positive step forward for the NDIS , " Porter said . <p> " The NDIS is a large and complex reform , and I do n't think that anyone should underestimate the importance of what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task ahead of it during transition . " <p> Assistant Minister for Disability Services Jane Prentice said the recommendations of the report focused on continual quality improvements at the NDIA . <p> " This will embed their service delivery operating model and build their capability to successfully manage change , " Prentice said . <p> " The impact and scale of recent issues was unacceptable for NDIS participants , their families , carers and providers . <p> " Governments will support the NDIA through a process of continual improvement , to build systematic approaches to managing change and guiding people through new processes .

 Origins of World Charity Day <p> By Matthew Turnour , <p> International charity day is an opportunity to pause and reflect on the many examples of individuals and nations doing good , writes Brisbane lawyer Dr Matthew Turnour who asks whether Australia should embed recognition of the day into our charity laws . <p> World Charity Day is celebrated on 5 September . It is a good time to stop and remember how the day came about . It is an opportunity to reflect on examples provided to us by nations , businesses and individuals . <p> We have the day to encourage charity . The United Nations chose the anniversary of the death of Mother Teresa to celebrate charity with the first year of celebration being 2013 . <p> Australia was a co-sponsor of the resolution which invites not just member states but all " organisations , as well as civil society , including non-governmental organisations and individuals , to commemorate the day in an appropriate manner , by encouraging charity , including through education and public awareness-raising activities . " <p> Although seeds of the idea are evident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World Charity Day in 2011 . Hungary did more than just set aside a day to encourage charity . Perhaps its most famous action to encourage charity ( and the development of the NGO sector generally ) was its percentage tax . In 1996 , Hungary introduced what have become known as Percentage Laws , which allow taxpayers to allocate a percentage of their income tax to specific Not for Profit organisations . By 2004 , the idea had also been adopted in Slovakia , Lithuania , Poland and Romania . <p> The most recent nation to recognise 5 September as a national charity day is China . It embedded the date in charity legislation passed on 16 March 2016 . Again the legislation was part of a broader strategy to encourage philanthropy with one of the more remarkable aspects being the enactment of the legal infrastructure to enable the emergence of charitable trusts . <p> The call for a national charity day in China seems have begun as a grassroots movement in Shandong province in 2006 . The newspaper , China Daily of 19 May 2007 reported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere 1.7 billion yuan ( A$221 million ) , that is , a per capita donation of just over one yuan . " <p> Keen to do something about this , citizens began the movement that has culminated in not just the recognition of the day , but broader legislation to support the emergence and growth of the charity sector . The China Daily of 31 March 2016 reported that giving grew steadily over the period to 104.2 billion yuan in 2014 which is 0.16 per cent of GDP . <p> In Australia it is easy to become discouraged about evidence of decline in our civic engagement . It is important to remember that there remain many encouraging factors . The available data suggests that 87 per cent of Australians made some form of contribution to charity in 2014 and 78 per cent of Australians support at least one charity regularly . That year we gave nearly $7 billion in donations and bequests . Around 2 million of us volunteered . These are not just statistics . They translate into real life stories . <p> Caring for their neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I note was recently canonised , a manufacturer of solar lighting in southern Queensland made his product available at cost to anyone who would buy the product as a gift for villagers in the Solomon Islands . Over 180 units , enough to light a whole village , were purchased and donated . A land developer is in negotiations with a charity to provide not just land for a newly emerging development but also at least one community development officer . One woman gave money to a refugee woman she knows who is struggling to feed her family . These are just snippets of stories that have touched me over the last few weeks . <p> We can be inspired by the individuals around us to work privately and through businesses to do more for one another . We can also think as a nation whether , like China , we should embed in our laws charity recognition one day each year . As we approach tax reform we can ask should we , like Hungary , be doing more to encourage philanthropy through tax ?

 ? Perhaps Not So Scary After All <p> It 's no longer enough for your corporate partnerships to align in reputation alone -- if you 're not sharing tangible community impact , it 's not going to be worth your time , nor theirs , writes Good2Give CEO Lisa Grinham . <p> Over the last two weeks , Good2Give brought together 60 professionals who manage large corporate foundations and quite hefty community budgets . <p> We hold these events regularly to nut out what 's working and hopefully learn from each other 's wins and hiccups . This month we spoke to how corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) was shaping up for Australia 's top 100 ASX companies and whether it in fact had delivered on the business case once promised . <p> While CSR for these companies is now virtually a license to operate , those managing strategic community initiatives , continue to face scrutiny on their budgets and whether they 're worth further investment . <p> When it comes to an organisational restructure , a rebrand or new senior leadership , it does n't seem to matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops up : " How much do we really want to invest in the feel good ? " <p> This is particularly the case when a company 's core values come under review . Building a business case to express these in the community becomes that much harder to make . Potentially leaving CSR ( and their budgets ) on rocky grounds . <p> Successful program managers are navigating this by setting up committees with senior leadership to reset expectations and apply some steady measures of how this will be achieved . Amidst the vast array of business measures that companies are now exploring through altruism and shared value , improved reputation remains an oldie but goldie . <p> We continue to hear the astronomical difference that workplace giving , grant programs , strong charity partnerships , volunteering and the like , have on company reputations . One ASX company recorded improvements in their net promoter scores of between 10 and 20 points due to their community program . <p> And when it comes to building or protecting company reputation , executives would be hard pressed to see such impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this community work that our clients are demonstrating as saving shareholder support amidst protests , and preserving business amidst challenging press . <p> At the recent forums , perceived insincerity of CSR was raised on more than one occasion as a big inhibitor to this from receiving acknowledgement in the boardroom and indeed even with staff . Public and stakeholder scepticism cuts deep into ongoing senior support of CSR budgets . So let 's not make these programs insincere , let 's give companies all the justification they need to get buy in and further investment . <p> This not only means that community programs need to stay true to the company 's services and values , but from a charity perspective , it also means demonstrating real impact that the public can acknowledge and their shareholders can be proud of . <p> Sophisticated CSR teams are not only espousing the funds granted , the number of charities supported , but they 're shouting out the community difference they 've made . And in turn they 're using services like Good2Give 's to assess not only whether an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the financial diligence , governance and strategic direction to deliver on its mission . <p> Admittedly , I 've been somewhat concerned by the rising professionalisation of charities . Particularly as AICD NFP sector leader Phil Butler recently pointed out , in a number of industries we 're seeing charities competing for clients with the very companies they previously received philanthropy from . <p> However , when it comes to preserving and building corporate budgets for community investment , the more professional they are in governance and accountability , the better . More so , the better charities are at working strategically and not only assessing their output but more importantly demonstrating their impact , the easier it will be for companies to assure their public and preserve valuable community budgets . <p> We 're still a long way from achieving the corporate community investment levels apparent in Europe and America , and it will be a while before I suspect the 1 per cent profit campaign will take off here . Strong community cases for the investment of corporate support however , will do nothing but provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 ASX . <p> About the author : Lisa Grinham is the CEO of Good2Give , a Not for Profit which works with companies to encourage corporate philanthropy via effective corporate community investment programs .

 Future Needs a Cooperative Approach <p> By Lorraine Gordon , <p> The answer to a more profitable agricultural sector is for farmers to work together , writes Lorraine Gordon , the new director of the federal government 's Farm Co-operatives and Collaboration Pilot Program . <p> The role of farming in Australia is well-beyond the immediate need to feed , clothe and house ourselves . <p> As the mining industry sags , agriculture is re-emerging as our in-demand export earner . However , its economic importance is more clearly defined in our rural and regional communities . <p> Agriculture represents approximately 3 per cent of Australia 's GDP but it is estimated that the sector represents more than 40 per cent of the GDP of regional economies . Once multiplier effects are taken into account , this is as high as 70 to 80 per cent in most small towns . <p> In 2008 , ABARE estimated that dairying delivered a regional economic multiplier effect of about 2.5 . This prosperity flow-on will be sorely missed at the moment among our dairy-dependent communities . <p> Price volatility , marketplace shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges are as endless as the capacity of farmers to adapt . <p> As a beef producer , I know I have to farm smarter and leaner . Across the country and across the many commodity groups , farmers have adopted complex new technologies , applied world-leading research and development , upskilled ourselves and our workers , adapted to climate change and boosted water use efficiency . We have worked even harder to use less chemicals and fuel while improving soil health , waterways , biodiversity and revegetation . <p> Stewardship of the land and sustainability of farming practices are part of modern agriculture 's landscape . <p> Now , with support from the federal government , we are turning our attention to a new area of reform : building the capacity of farmers , fishers and foresters to collaborate and claim marketplace power . <p> The answer to a more profitable agricultural sector is for farmers to work together to value-add to their production , to secure premium pricing , to scale-up production , to attract capital investment , to earn new markets or to secure lower input costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collaboration Pilot Program ( Farming Together ) . <p> I left a terrific job to take up the challenge of driving this $14.9 million initiative . I really believe in this program . When it came across my desk I thought " this is a game changer " . <p> The team assembled to deliver this two-year pilot program include experts drawn from a wide range of agricultural fields some are still actively farming . The program has a national footprint stretching from Western Australia to the Northern Territory with an advisory board of ag-industry leaders . <p> We met with 220-plus farmers and farm advisors in late September to launch the program and its easy-to-use website portal . <p> The initial offering we bring to all farmers is a free consultation worth more than $1,000 to discuss their opportunities and appetite to create a successful collaborative group . This could be either as a structured co-operative , as a collective bargaining entity or as a less-formal collaborative group . The opportunity exists for any grouping of at least two farmers who are Australian citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture and Farming Together draws on that fundamental strength . <p> We already have some inspirational groupings that are seeing primary producers become price-makers not price-takers . Farming Together is picking up the winning traits of these groups and sharing them across the country ... and we are finding farmers are increasingly eager to participate . <p> When he launched Farming Together last April , Barnaby Joyce , the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources said : " The further you reach down the supply chain the better returns received at the farm gate it 's that simple . It 's better for the farmer , and it 's better for local communities and the people who live and work there . " <p> Looking at the bigger picture , new free trade deals with China , Korea and Japan are opening up market access for a wide range of our primary products to Asia 's increasingly middle-class and hungry -- populations . <p> We need to build capacity between our farms . We need to shift this dynamism post-farm gate , to secure more control further up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers . <p> Not only could Farming Together turn agricultural industries around , it could revive rural and regional communities and bring greater prosperity across Australia . <p> Farming Together has a vision of regional self-reliance leading to secure returns for agricultural outputs and , eventually , robust firms acting as trusted exporters and regional employers ... what 's not to love about this project ? <p> About the author : Lorraine Gordon is the new director of the federal government 's Farm Co-operatives and Collaboration Pilot Program a national , two-year $14.9 million program to develop and support co-operatives , collective bargaining groups and collaborations among Australia 's primary producers .

 Govt to Stop Criminalisation of the Unemployed <p> Poor Australians are being criminalised by the social security system , according to an alliance of organisations that are demanding the government address the country 's growing employment crisis . <p> The Australian Council of Social Services , the Australian Council of Trade Unions , the Australian Unemployed Workers ' Union , the Anti-Poverty Network ( South Australia ) , the Centre of Full Employment and Equity , the Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition and Guardian columnist Van Badham have joined forces to co-sign an open letter to the government to put a stop to the " criminalisation of the unemployed " . <p> The signatories want action from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to implement economic and social policies that " do not punish Australian people " who are unemployed or are social welfare recipients . <p> " With 18 job seekers competing for every job vacancy in Australia , millions of Australians are being condemned to lives below the poverty line due to no fault of their own , " the statement said . <p> " Despite this jobs crisis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social security recipients by adopting a punitive approach , which has led to the criminalisation of poor Australians . <p> " It is imperative that all parties in the federal parliament take responsibility for Australia 's worsening employment crisis and work together to implement new policies to support Australians without work . " <p> Australian Unemployed Workers ' Union secretary Owen Bennett said it was a " national emergency " . <p> " For years , both sides of politics have failed to address Australia 's employment crisis or the increasingly punitive social security system , " Bennett said . <p> " As a result , we now have three million Australians out of work and a social security system that forces millions of Australians to live in extreme poverty . <p> " This is a national emergency , nothing less . As a country , we can no longer afford a government that continues to ignore this crisis . " <p> In particular the alliance is calling for the government to : <p> abolish Work for the Dole and Community Development Program ( CDP ) <p> raise Newstart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide adequate income security for older people <p> reverse changes to the single parent pension <p> abolish mandatory income management <p> make necessary and positive changes to the punitive employment services industry <p> loosen eligibility requirements for Disability Support Pension ( DSP ) . <p> ACTU president Ged Kearney said the government needed to make positive policy changes . <p> " Australia is becoming a country with an underclass of unemployed people who are unable to find work , with 18 job seekers for every job vacancy , " Kearney said . <p> " We are also seeing crisis levels of youth unemployment , with more than 30 per cent of young people in some Australian towns unable to find a job . " <p> " Rather than penalising and punishing people who ca n't find a job or are unable to work , the Turnbull Government should make positive policy changes that help these people get back on their feet or stay afloat . " <p> The alliance follows the Solving Our Employment Crisis conference which was held in Melbourne earlier this year , where the organisations agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment crisis and the punitive social security system " . <p> Anti-Poverty Network SA coordinator Pas Forgione told Pro Bono Australia News there was a convergence of interest between the different organisations . <p> " In my time advocating for unemployed people and other people on income support that was really the first time that that sort of gathering took place and it was very impressive to see a convergence of interest and to see a recognition that attacks on unemployed people and attacks on sole parents and disability pensioners and other groups of people are income support are everyone 's business . These attacks not only hurt the people directly affected but are also harmful to the rest of the community , " Forgione said . <p> According to the statement this will be the first of many joint campaigns to this end . <p> Forgione said the alliance was " hopeful " but not " holding their breath " . <p> " I think it is pretty clear that the government 's agenda is not an agenda that is friendly to unemployed people and to other welfare recipients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most recent example of this is what is happening around the clean energy supplement and frankly we are appalled . <p> " The clean energy supplement represents the first real increase to the incomes of the unemployed in over 20 years and one of the first acts of the newly elected Turnbull government is to scrap that increase and we think that is staggering . <p> " We have a government that just does n't get it and when it comes to unemployment it is happy to blame the unemployed for being out of work and to foster all sort of harmful myths about unemployment . The government knows full well there are n't enough jobs to go around , it is hardly a secret but it is much more convenient instead to blame the victims . <p> " We have no illusions about where the government stands on people on income support and we know there is a major fight to force the government to treat those out of work with respect and justice . " <p> Forgione said the culture of blaming the unemployed for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The fact of the matter is unemployment is a structural thing , it is built into the economy that there is simply not enough jobs to go around , " he said . <p> " The problem is our whole conversation on unemployment starts from the wrong place , it does n't start from this basic fact that the supply of jobs is small and the supply of people looking for jobs is big , it starts from the fact that if you are unemployed there must be something wrong with you , some lack of skill , some sort of deficiency , some lack of work ethic or motivation on your part that is stopping you from looking for work . <p> " We see this in the media , this constant language the use of terms like ' welfare rorters ' and ' dole bludgers ' which is meant to create the climate where people on income support are under suspicion , where it is assumed that they could in fact work but freely choose to survive on an income that is well below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the entire conversation around unemployment partly because it is actually damaging the mental health of unemployed people for them to be blamed for being out of work , for them to be told it is their fault if they can not find a job . Not only is this untrue , but unemployed people often internalise ... and they end up blaming on themselves and that is completely wrong . <p> " Because frankly it is the government who is letting down unemployed people by not creating enough jobs to go around , not unemployed people who are trying their hardest to look for work , unemployed people desperately want to work because they do n't want to survive on $266 a week , they do n't want to live on an income that is way , way below the poverty line .

 Over ' Divisive ' Maiden Speech <p> One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has come under fire for the " crude , divisive , ill-informed Islamophobic rhetoric " that formed part of her maiden speech to the Australian Senate . <p> Muslim leaders and politicians have united to reject Hanson 's call for a ban on immigration and her claim Australia was " at risk of being swamped by Muslims " . <p> Echoing fears aired in her 1996 address about multiculturalism , she claimed in the Senate on Wednesday that Australians were " fearful " and cited , without evidence , that organised crime rates were higher among Muslim populations . <p> " Islam can not have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open , secular and cohesive society , " Hanson said . <p> " We have seen the destruction that it is causing around the world .

Have no doubt that we will be living under sharia law and treated as second-class citizens with second-class rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' She 'll be right , mate . ' " <p> The president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils , Keysar Trad , said the speech displayed ignorance about Islam and he commended the prime minister for " showing leadership and a positive direction for Australian society in rejecting Hanson 's divisive rhetoric " . <p> " In her maiden speech in the Senate , Pauline Hanson made wild allegations and grossly exaggerated generalisations against Islam and Australian Muslims , " Trad said . <p> " Her words were ill-informed , hurtful , divisive and create tremendous concern for Muslim Australians and Australian society . <p> " Ms Hanson 's comments confound the dictates of the conscience of every decent Australian , such comments are divisive , harmful to Australian society and embarrassing to our senate and our nation . " <p> Her comments sparked members of the Greens to walk out less than halfway through the speech . <p> Greens leader Richard Di Natale later tweeted : " Racism has no place in parliament but that is what we have just heard from Senator Hanson . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However former prime minister John Howard told ABC TV Hanson was entitled to be treated in a respectful fashion by the rest of parliament . <p> " In relation to Pauline Hanson , the mistake that was made 20 years ago of trying to demonise her and demonise her supporters should not be repeated , " Howard said . <p> Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the ABC that Hanson had " rightly taken her seat in the Senate " and was entitled to her views . <p> " I disagree with many of them , as would other Australians , " Bishop said . <p> " But one of the strengths of this country is that we do believe in freedom of speech , we believe in open debate and the opportunity to debate dissenting voices .

" <p> Dellal said politicians should focus on preserving social cohesion . <p> " Australia has always been a draw card for those with imagination and the capacity to work hard , seize opportunities and build something new , " he said . <p> " Generations of migrants from all over the world have come here to create a better future for themselves and their children . <p> " So Australia 's future prosperity will depend on its ability to maintain social cohesion while significantly increasing population through immigration intakes . <p> " That is obviously going to involve a greater level of managing and understanding of cultural diversity than ever before and in the interest of the nation ... so the question we should be looking at is how do we actually ... preserve social cohesion and how do we strengthen that . Because social cohesion comes under threat when there are increasing levels of fear and misunderstandings within the community and divisions and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we are hearing in some of this rhetoric . " <p> He said the Australian multicultural experience was a reality . <p> " Of course we have challenges , but I do n't believe it will be at the demise of our society because the Australian multicultural experience is a reality , that 's a fact , it is not a vision , much less an ideology or creed , it describes societies like Australia , as they are , and as they are destined to be , " he said . <p> " It is the institution of Australian democracy that enables that diversity in our society to flourish . It 's important to highlight it is being built on evolving values of Australian democracy and citizenship ... these are the sorts of things that our leaders should be talking about . <p> " What you want is politicians working together and if there are issues we need to ensure that there is an understanding that there are challenges and issues and we need to resolve it . <p> " You do n't want to create divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . <p> " It is easy to make these sorts of remarks that are emotional or emotive , because all that does is create animosity ... it is important to ensure you are representing the views of all Australians , it is important that you do n't tarnish everyone with the same brush . " <p> Dellal highlighted that the Australian Muslim Community was not homogenous . <p> " It is so diverse , " he said . <p> " It is close to 30 to 40 different nationalities and ethnic groups , all with different levels of religiosity and ... that is never translated or actually seen in our media or in our public discussion . That diversity within the Australian muslim community is never properly acknowledged because if you were able to understand that then you would see how people have integrated and their roles in terms of Australian Muslims and the role they play as law abiding citizens . <p> " So you need to demonstrate all that so you take away the fears , because with the challenges there is also so many good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one . <p> " It 's really important that we understand that diversity has enriched all our lives , we can all agree to that , but it also pushes each and everyone of us to accept a different reality from our own and that 's the challenge . <p> " We need good leadership around that so that people can understand that by creating fear or misunderstanding or fear of the unknown , creates further barriers , you need to break down those barriers . <p> " If you are arguing the fact that you want people to integrate , then if you remove those barriers then people will integrate but if you create barriers of fear they also are fearful of integrating because they do n't know how they are going to be responded to .

 Bono Australia News the philanthropy sector had always been at the forefront of change , and this openness needed to continue . <p> " Being a 21st century philanthropist is figuring out how , in our current context , we can use the resources we have , " Exel said . <p> " Whether that 's the money we have , whether it 's a skill we have or the time we have , whether it 's the companies that we run , figuring out how we can use those resources to affect positive change in the current context that we operate in . <p> " A hundred years ago the context was incredibly different to the context we 're operating in now . But philanthropists were still innovating , they were still doing things that were leading the way , they were still sitting on frontiers , they were just doing it in a very different context . " <p> Exel said 21st century philanthropists were operating in a context of a globalised economy and " incredible global disparity " in terms of income distribution . <p> She also said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical transparency " and the internet , which creates both risks and opportunities . <p> But she said philanthropists were already adapting to the new context . <p> " We 're seeing that in a number of different ways by using the tools that the 21st century gives us , " she said . <p> " The most evident one of that is the internet and radical transparency and we see that for instance with the crowdfunding movement , and different ways of thinking about raising funding for vulnerable clients or important needs . " <p> Another key societal change which requires innovation in philanthropy is the evolution of business . <p> Exel said business was redefining itself and starting to put concepts of philanthropy and purpose at its centre . <p> " I think philanthropists can use the changing expectations and role of business in the world as part of their bag of tricks , " she said . <p> " We 're also seeing , and again a lot of this is coming from this globalised technology-enabled economy that we 're living in ... the breaking down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Not for Profit sector is no longer completely separate from the for-profit sector , or from the government sector or from other sectors of society . <p> " We 're seeing cross-sector , cross-discipline hybrid models , and so I think one of the key tools that we will see philanthropists use in this context is tools of partnership . I think we 're going to see many more collaborations and partnerships across sectors and across disciplines than we 've ever seen before , and that is an incredibly good thing because boy do we need it as a world . " <p> However , she said the core principles of traditional philanthropy should always be held onto . <p> " If you come back to the number one key thing about philanthropy , it 's honouring the concept of giving to others , and that giving can be done in different ways , but it 's honouring giving as the highest expression of humanity , " she said . <p> " I worry that in the excitement of innovative philanthropy , that sometimes we can disparage the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparage the concept of giving , and I think that 's a fundamental mistake . <p> " At the cornerstone of the evolution of society and growth is the concept of reaching out to others and giving .

 to outdo corporate sponsorship of the arts in Australia , according to new research . <p> New figures compiled by the Australian Major Performing Arts Group ( AMPAG ) found that since its first survey of the major performing arts companies in 2001 , total private sector revenue had increased by $52.2 million , or 172.6 per cent . <p> Of the 2015 total revenue of $82.5 million , $44.2 million ( 54 per cent ) was received as donations , $35.6 million ( 43 per cent ) was from corporate sponsorships and a net amount of $2.7 million ( 3 per cent ) came from fundraising events . <p> AMPAG said the major performing arts ( MPA ) companies had successfully leveraged their core government investment through a mixture of long-term relationships and a general broadening of the overall base of support . <p> Significantly , it said the donor base across the group has grown year on year over the last five years . <p> In 2015 the group reported donations from individual donors compared to 17,422 in 2011 . However , the average donation is 39 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector support for the arts now comprises 16 per cent of total income , with 43 per cent from performance income , 30 per cent government grants for core funding ( federal and state ) , 4 per cent grants for specific projects / initiatives and 7 per cent from other income . <p> executive director Bethwyn Serow said the MPA companies ' total year-on-year results provided a sense of the growth in opportunities and the increase in the overall pool of resources . <p> " The growth in revenue in 2015 from corporate sponsorships , donations and fundraising of 5.1 per cent , although ahead of CPI , is below last year 's rate of 9.7 per cent . While the results are encouraging , they are n't consistent , " Serow said . <p> " The ability to raise private sector support in individual companies within the MPA group varies due to a range of factors including individual state economic conditions , the company 's audience profile , touring footprint , program initiatives and special capital-raising campaigns . " <p> She said large companies received substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medium companies . <p> " We can never take private sector support for granted their partnerships and support are invaluable and extend the capacity of the companies to commission new work , extend arts education , remove barriers for participation , and support artists to develop and to take risks , " she said . <p> This support creates vital creative legacies and can be instrumental in securing performance and operational spaces , not only for this generation , but for those that follow . <p> " Ensuring our major companies are stable and sustainable as well as artistically vibrant and engaging requires a careful balance and understanding of the important contributions each area of support makes to both the companies themselves and the cultural life of the country . " <p> said it was also important that the government does n't relax its responsibility in supporting Australia 's arts sector . <p> " Herein lies an ongoing challenge the arts are highly labour-intensive , with a cost base that almost always runs ahead of CPI , and this is in the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indexed contributions . It has always been a complex and interdependent relationship , with government funding an essential element in generating support from the private sector , " she said . <p> chair John Irving said the support of corporate sponsors and donors enabled them to expand and to innovate . <p> " Each year they begin with the need to grow their earnings as costs rise , if only to match what they did the year before . However , every major performing arts company is ambitious and has a unique abundance of talent and skills to nurture its art form and to create a variety of opportunities for Australians to experience and engage with the arts , " Irving said . <p> " The role of government in providing stable base funding remains critical to the long-term sustainability of the major companies . Governments at state and federal level get a great return on their investments in the major companies who leverage that investment many times over to achieve great work and add enormously to the cultural fabric of the country .

 Australians want to ban Muslim immigration , according to a new poll . <p> A survey , conducted by Essential Research , has revealed that 49 per cent of people said they would support a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia , with 60 per cent of Coalition voters , 40 per cent of Labor and 34 per cent of Greens backing the ban . <p> The main reason given was because that " they do not integrate into Australian society " ( 41 per cent ) followed by the " terrorist threat " ( 27 per cent ) . <p> Just 40 per cent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they would oppose it , with stronger opposition coming from the younger voters 58 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds , compared to just 33 per cent of over 65s , disagreed with the ban . <p> The release of the poll on Wednesday comes a week after Pauline Hanson caused outrage with her maiden speech in the Senate during which she claimed Australia was " at risk of being swamped by Muslims " . <p> Echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed Australians were " fearful " and that Islam could not have a significant presence in Australia if " we were to live in an open , secular and cohesive society " . <p> " We have seen the destruction that it is causing around the world , " Hanson said . <p> " If we do not make changes now , there will be no hope in the future . Have no doubt that we will be living under sharia law and treated as second-class citizens with second-class rights if we keep heading down the path with the attitude , ' She 'll be right , mate . ' " <p> Research director at Essential Media Andrew Bunn told Pro Bono Australia News the poll showed there was more support for Hanson 's views than expected . <p> " We were surprised , " Bunn said . <p> " We expected there would be some underlying support for it , in fact we were so surprised we ran it the poll again , that is the following week , to test it and we got exactly the same answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sorts of views are not fringe views , these are mainstream views . <p> " I think , sort of the purpose in releasing it was to demonstrate that these are not views we can ignore and to a certain degree Pauline Hanson is reflecting the views of a large number of people and a larger number of people than we might have thought . " <p> Bunn said the poll was conducted in August , before Hanson 's maiden speech but it referred to statements she has previously made . <p> " So the poll was actually conducted after the election but certainly before her maiden speech where she made those statements more explicitly , " he said . <p> " But we actually asked a question attributing the statement to Pauline Hanson and so certainly it was very much associated with the view she has put in .

 contestability and informed user choice could improve outcomes in many , but not all , Australia human services , according to a preliminary report by the Productivity Commission . <p> The commission 's preliminary findings point to six priority areas where competition models could improve outcomes for people who use human services , and the community as a whole . <p> The report said that reform could offer the greatest improvements for people who use social housing , public hospitals , specialist palliative care , public dental services , services in remote Indigenous communities , and grant-based family and community services . <p> " Well-designed reform , underpinned by strong government stewardship , could improve the quality of services , increase access to services , and help people have a greater say over the services they use and who provides them , " the report said . <p> The purpose of the PC preliminary report is to obtain public feedback on the commission 's findings before the release of its study report in November 2016 . <p> According to the Terms of Reference for the inquiry : " Australia 's human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for services due to the ageing population , the effect of technology and cost increases associated with new and more complex service provision demands . " <p> The report 's preliminary findings said competition between service providers can drive innovation and create incentives for providers to be more responsive to the needs and preferences of users , and creating contestable arrangements amongst providers can achieve many of the benefits of effective competition . <p> However the report said for some services , and in some settings , direct government provision of services would be the best way to improve the wellbeing of individuals and families . <p> " Reform in the areas we have identified has the potential to improve the lives of users and the welfare of the whole community , " productivity commissioner Stephen King said . <p> " The services we have identified are all different , and one policy response will not fit all . We will be taking a case by case approach to unlocking the potential for reform . " <p> The report said that change must come with strong and effective stewardship from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . <p> " Government stewardship is critical . This includes ensuring human services meet standards of quality , suitability and accessibility , giving people the support they need to make choices , ensuring that appropriate consumer safeguards are in place , and encouraging and adopting ongoing improvements to service provision , " the report said . <p> It said the introduction of greater competition , contestability and user choice may not always be the best approach to reform . <p> " One size does not fit all and redesigning the provision of human services needs to account for a range of features , including : the rationale for government involvement ; the outcomes the services are intended to achieve ; the nature of the services and the dynamics of the markets in which the services are provided ; the characteristics and capabilities of users ; and the diversity in purpose , size , scale and scope of providers , " the report said . <p> " Not all of these features are clear cut or measurable , and all change over time . Further , reforms may raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and different design options will have different fiscal implications for government . " <p> Community Council for Australia CEO David Crosbie said the PC preliminary findings offered a very useful perspective on the capacity to improve services by giving greater choice to consumers . <p> " The international experience clearly demonstrates better services with increased public accountability in some areas of service delivery . In many of our systems including most of our health care services -- Australia lacks any real transparency or accountability , " Crosbie said . <p> " Australian GPs , hospitals and many medical specialists run what could best be termed stand and deliver services with no public accountability for outcomes or the quality of services . <p> " CCA will be working with our members to develop a considered response to the first set of findings from the Productivity Commission in the Review into Human Services .

 urged the federal government to take action to reduce the number of older women becoming homeless . <p> Mission Australia 's CEO Catherine Yeomans warned that without an increase in appropriate affordable housing , the numbers of vulnerable older women without a safe place to live would continue to climb in Australia . <p> " We know from our services and the wider sector that this is a growing problem , " Yeomans said . <p> Her comments come in the lead up to the International Day of Older Persons on 1 October . <p> Census data from 2011 indicated an estimated one in seven , or close to 15,000 , homeless people were over 55 years , an increase of 19.2 per cent from the 2006 Census , while 5,330 women over 55 identified as homeless in 2011 , up 12 per cent from 2006 . <p> " With the housing affordability crisis , older women and particularly single older women who are renting are particularly vulnerable to rental stress and at risk of homelessness . Small changes in their financial circumstances can affect their ability to pay rent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health costs arise or there is an increase rise in their electricity bill , " Yeomans said . <p> " They can be forced to dip into their limited retirement savings , if any , to make ends meet . We know that women tend to have less superannuation than men due to time out of the labour market for caring and lower average earnings . When that dries up , they then fall into unstable , unsuitable accommodation such as refuges , hostels or onto the streets . " <p> Yeomans said that with a growing housing affordability crisis and with Australia 's ageing population predicted to double from 2010 to 2050 , the issue will only continue unless the federal government takes action . <p> " Women who become homeless for the first time in later life are likely to have been private renters with a stable housing history . But homelessness may be triggered by a crisis such as widowhood , marital breakdown , a health crisis , financial difficulties after retirement , onset of a mental illness , unaffordable rent , eviction and accessibility problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing demand for homes which are accessible for older people , Mission Australia has urged the Commonwealth , state and territory governments to facilitate funding of at least 200,000 new social homes by 2025 and capital works programs to update existing social infrastructure . <p> The organisation is also calling for a pipeline of new affordable housing facilitated by leveraging private investment . <p> " Affordable housing is key to both preventing homelessness and moving people out of homelessness when it occurs . The risk of homelessness for older women can be greatly reduced by adequate provision of housing that is affordable on the aged pension , suitable to their needs and allows them to age in place . That way they can live independently in the community , with support in their homes if needed , " Yeomans said . <p> " Addressing retirement income policies is also an important part of the puzzle , with the age pension built on the assumption that people will own their homes at the point of retirement and therefore will need less income to survive .

 , released by national charity Lifeline Australia on Tuesday , revealed more than six out of 10 Australians " often feel lonely " . <p> Moreover , more than 80 per cent of the 3,100 people surveyed , believed society was becoming a lonelier place , even though 44.14 per cent of those were currently living with their spouse . <p> Lifeline Australia CEO Pete Shmigel told Pro Bono Australia News the survey highlighted the " lifesaving importance " of caring real-world relationships , as well as the need for whole communities to play a role in combating " Australia 's suicide emergency " . <p> " For a society that is more technologically connected than we have ever been , these results suggest we 're overlooking good old-fashioned care and compassion when it comes to our mental health and wellbeing , " Shmigel said . <p> " We have always had a significant proportion of our callers who talk about loneliness and talk about social isolation , and in some of their cases it is part of a crisis and in some of their cases it is part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been kind of noticing , at least anecdotally on the lines , a little bit more of it and for example more mentions of loneliness together with social media . <p> " So that is why we decided to do the survey to get a finger on the pulse of the community , what is it thinking about loneliness , how does it experience loneliness , is there something more we should be doing as a service provider . " <p> The survey revealed that even though more people were increasingly feeling lonely , more than 70 per cent had never called Lifeline or a similar service . <p> said society needed to send a message that there was help . <p> " Of the 60 per cent of respondents who said they ' often felt lonely ' , a large cohort lived with a partner and / or children . This is consistent with Lifeline data showing that , while a majority of callers ( 55 per cent ) to our 13 11 14 crisis line live alone , often without strong support networks , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from loved ones in their own homes , " he said . <p> " We as a community need to be more mindful of how the people in our lives are coping , and send a strong message that no person in crisis should have to be alone -- help is available . <p> " It shows me that because people still feel lonely in family contexts and feel lonely in friendship contexts and feel lonely in big rooms of people , that there are a couple of things at play here . <p> " One is that I think the pace of life is so intense at the moment , we 're spending something like 46 hours a week online alone , always on task , that it is possible to be lonely and not have the capacity to catch up even with the people who are closest to us , not to have those real and meaningful conversations because we 're always so busy and so hectic . <p> " The other aspect that I think we should note is I think loneliness is still stigmatised to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say ' I 'm lonely ' , I think a lot of people would probably still think they would be judged for that kind of a statement . <p> " That 's the real opportunity here is to slow down , have the real conversations , give yourself a chance to pause and to centre and be mindful and connect in the real world in meaningful ways . <p> " It 's ok to ask for help around loneliness . Loneliness happens to a lot of us , it only gets risky , if you will , when it goes unaddressed , when we think it is permanent and then it can really erode our resilience and make us very susceptible to a lack of emotional wellbeing and even sometimes suicide , so put up your hand , it happens to a lot of us and it 's ok to talk about it .

Suicide is an extremely complex phenomenon , " Shmigel said . <p> " But because the numbers are going up we do have to challenge the current narrative and we do have to question the causes and that means thinking more broadly not just for example about mental illness as a cause of suicide and sort of medical reasons for suicide but thinking about emotional factors like loneliness , and thinking about social factors like isolation and connection and economic restructures , and thinking about technological factors like spending a lot more time online . It is probably in some mix of those things that we can find better answers to create more suicide safe communities .

 Christian Porter has been accused of ignoring the gap between job vacancies and unemployed people after he said welfare groups calling for a Newstart increase " lack imagination " . <p> Social Services Minister Christian Porter has been accused of ignoring the gap between job vacancies and unemployed people after he said welfare groups calling for a Newstart increase " lack imagination " . <p> Porter recently released plans to " revolutionise " social security spending , with the aim of ending among at-risk groups . <p> The government will use data to evaluate which programs result in successful outcomes for welfare recipients -- starting with young people -- and discontinue those found to be unsuccessful . <p> Porter told Sky News that spending more money on welfare was not the answer , in response to Not for Profit organisations calling for an increase of the Newstart unemployment payment , which is currently at $528.70 a fortnight for singles and each for couples . <p> " That is a perfect example of just applying massive increases in money to all of the same processes and systems , " Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the same and it carries with it no guarantee that anything will change , that any lives will be improved in terms of their long-term progress . <p> " I do n't think that is an acceptable way to spend massive amounts of taxpayers ' money . It really lacks imagination . It shows a unwillingness to do things a little bit differently . " <p> " The ABS stats show us there is 713,300 people who are unemployed and job vacancies of 171,000 , so the simple maths tells us we ca n't just move people into jobs by making Newstart too little , " Chambers said . <p> " I accept that it 's a big policy issue in terms of finding the budget for it , but there is overwhelming evidence from every sector that Newstart is inadequate for a decent life . " <p> She said the government 's refusal to increase Newstart was " purely budgetary " and not about imagination . <p> " There 's an issue for the government , they want to balance their budget and they do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's purely budgetary , " she said . <p> " I think we do need to have a conversation about why is it seen to be a bad thing that governments spend money in the social services area . " <p> Porter also called on welfare organisations to be " open-minded " and work with the government . <p> Part of the Coalition 's new approach includes a $96 million Try , Test and Learn fund , for the social services sector , academics and other stakeholders to put forward ideas . <p> " We are inviting them on this journey with us to try and assist us and I would just expect them to be open-minded , " Porter said . <p> Chambers said Anglicare was open to innovation and had the same goal as the government , but this did n't change the fact that Newstart was inadequate . <p> " We would be right there with Minister Porter ... we do n't want people on Newstart , we do n't want them on it for a long time , " she said . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less engaged , they do n't have the same levels of wellbeing overall that people who participate do , so nobody wants people on Newstart . <p> " But when we 've got those kind of figures where ... there 's something like one job vacancy for every seven unemployed people , and that 's not talking about underemployment ... then it 's not a reality . <p> " There will be people on Newstart and we need to make it adequate so that they can actually use their time on Newstart to look for jobs , to study , to undertake voluntary work ... so that when there are jobs they are actually better positioned to take them . " <p> But she said their research showed people on Newstart spend most of their time and most of their money on basics , searching for where food is on special and " being very imaginative " with their budgeting . <p> " In fact that 's there the imagination comes in -- people on Newstart have to be so imaginative with their budgets and how to make it last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be putting into looking for jobs if there were jobs available , " she said . <p> However , Chambers did agree that the current system is n't working , and said Anglicare was excited to be part of the new approach . <p> " We 're looking forward to working with the minister and his department as the Try , Test and Learn rolls out , as we can get to actually read the welfare priority approach and work with the figures , " she said . <p> " But when it comes to it , we still need to actually be talking about the adequacy of Newstart because we 're still in a situation where there are n't enough jobs for the number of people who are unemployed . <p> " There is a basic mathematical difficulty , which is there are n't enough jobs for people who are unemployed ...

 Ikea on steroids " , the first flat-packed , off-grid , tiny homes will use vacant city spaces and cut the costs of standard housing . <p> Big World Homes is a social enterprise created , and so far largely funded , by architect Alexander Symes with the intention of tackling Australia 's housing affordability crisis . <p> " We 're excited to be launching one of the most progressive , socially-oriented , community-driven housing projects that Australia has ever seen , at a time when new options in affordable housing have never been more vital , " Symes said . <p> " A transitional housing product that offers a solution to people currently unable to get into home ownership will completely disrupt the housing industry in a way we 've never seen before . " <p> Australia 's five major metropolitan cities have been classified as " severely unaffordable " for the past 11 years , according to the 2016 Demographia annual report . <p> The first home was constructed in Sydney last week , where a typical house currently costs more than $1 million -- 5.6 times the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off-the-grid and is designed to be built by two unskilled people in a few days using a hammer and a drill . It 's also legally considered a caravan , which means it can be parked on private land . <p> By removing labour and land costs , the homes cut up to 80 per cent of the costs of a similar stand-alone dwelling costing between $60,000 to $80,000 to buy and build . <p> Artist rendered image <p> Dr Joanne Jakovich , co-innovator of Big World Homes and founder of Strategic Open Urbanism Platform , said the social enterprise creates pop-up , transitional communities , as well as an additional rung on the homeownership ladder . <p> " The re-thinking of ' space ' and ' wealth ' is to housing what the sharing economy was to capitalism -- Big World Homes has an expansive effect , creating a new life and new communities in the city .

" <p> She said while the homes were intended to create transitional communities to help people move into homeownership , they could also be used long term . <p> Artist rendered image <p> " The way in which they 're insulated and weatherproofed and all that kind of stuff means they could feasibly be used longer term for someone if they were interested in living in a smaller space and challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of housing , " she said . <p> " The other thing about them is they are modular as well so you can buy two or three of them and connect them so they do n't necessarily have to be just a tiny home . For example if you 're a couple and you wanted to have two of them connected one could kind of serve as kitchen , dining , living and the other one could be a bedroom . <p> " There 's also a wider environmental impact and mission in the sense that they are off grid , they collect rainwater , the solar panels provide all of the electricity , and it 's very much about living alone in that lifestyle and reducing your footprint . " <p> Colley is also the Big World Homes " guinea pig " and will be moving into a home next year . " The idea is that for someone like myself , who spends a very large portion of my income on rent , that I move into a Big World Home in order to remove myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a deposit on an apartment , or on a home , " she said . <p> " I actually agreed to do this before I 'd seen it .

It 's really well insulated and really well weather proofed . The external material we use on the outside aerates the whole structure so it breathes really nicely , you do n't have your sheets with damper mould or anything like that . <p> " But for me it just feels like a really cozy spot to be , and I 'm thrilled about the idea of trying to shake up what it means to live in this city is there a different way we can approach housing and that we can tackle housing challenges ? <p> " I 'm sick of share housing , I 've done it for a long time , but I also have no chance of being able to afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm curious as to how something like this will work .

Perhaps just as importantly , it highlights the role of politics in these discussions . <p> I am not an economist and I struggle with the notion of applying the concepts of competition , contestability and user choice in what I see as distorted markets . Most commercial markets operate on the principle of competing to provide what the customer wants to buy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I buy and where I buy it , and they get my money / investment . This kind of open commercial market seems a long way from the typical human service provision . <p> In areas like health , it seems to me the provider has a much greater say in what options are available . Providers often compete in service provision , but their competition is to attract the main customer , the government . Providers compete to have governments fund their services or ( in the case of many professional groups ) to obtain higher fees for their programs and services . <p> The Productivity Commission suggests : " Competition and user choice are already common across a range of human services including general practitioners ( GPs ) and private dental services , and childcare centres . " <p> I am a male , over 50 years of age . I try not to go to the doctor because I know if I see a doctor , I will be asked to make several more appointments for various tests and screens . None of these additional appointments will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . Most of the additional appointments will require me to make another doctor 's appointment to get my results , which may then lead to further specialist appointments and trips to the pharmacy , all again in other locations . <p> Like many of you reading this article , I am very time poor . My health is passable , my fitness OK , so I wait for either a health breakdown ( touch wood I stay healthy ) or a break in my schedule to enable me to devote a few days of appointments to my preventative health , which never quite seems to happen . <p> The primary health care product or service I want and need is not available , and I am a well-informed consumer who can afford to pay . I can not go to a primary care service and in one day see a doctor , have my tests and screens , buy whatever prescriptions are needed , all at the one premise or in just one or two visits . My one visit to the doctor will almost certainly require at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tests , screening , medications , results etc . ) . <p> The lack of an effective primary health care service is not a reflection of low demand . The reason primary health care is not responsive to the needs of many consumers is because it does not suit the providers who fight to maintain their income by separating out their specialist service into a sub-market , restrict its supply , and operate what could only be described as mini cartels to exploit governments and consumers . How else do you describe the $4 billion a year payment the government gives a select group of pharmacy owners ( on top of Medicare etc. ) in a secret agreement ( even the government can not identify what owners receive what payments ) that also restricts who can own or operate a pharmacy and where they can operate ? <p> When you look through the almost 300 submissions to the Productivity Commission Inquiry into Human Services , there are more from health professionals and their unions than any other groups . What most of these submissions seek to do is maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes . <p> The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners provided a submission arguing in part that : <p> " Further , change to funding approaches have the potential to disrupt effective service models and systems to the community 's detriment ... It is important to note that it is difficult for consumers to make a genuinely informed choice regarding healthcare services beyond the measures of out-of-pocket cost and access . " <p> Not all GPs are focused on consumer health , wellbeing or choice . There is no clear data about the effectiveness of GP services , let alone outcome data about how much more or less healthy we are for receiving a service . <p> The RACGP submission is arguing that GPs must continue to be allowed to charge the government to see whoever they like for whatever they like from their " stand and deliver " , " take it or leave it " service model . <p> Most importantly , we should never ask a consumer what their health needs might be because that is a very difficult area and they would n't know except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is that very powerful anti-competitive cartels operate across our health system . They have one real purpose protect and increase incomes . It is not just GPs or specialists . <p> Pharmacies make significant profits selling completely useless snake oil products that cash in on poor health literacy and high marketing budgets ( how many " fat blaster " type products do you need on one shelf ? ) . They also have the audacity to continually seek to extend their role as primary health care providers while maintaining their monopoly and secrecy . If the provision of pharmacy services is really important to our health and wellbeing why ca n't we have fully trained and licensed pharmacists in our major supermarkets ( as in New Zealand where the cost of medicines is considerably lower and access much better ) or in our doctor 's surgeries ? <p> So why are pharmacies not on the list of human services the Productivity Commission believes would benefit from competition ? <p> The simple answer is politics . The Pharmacy Guild is one of the most powerful political lobby groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like the Pharmacy Guild , the various colleges of medical specialists operate some of the most effective business cartels in the world restricting how many places and controlling who can enter ( tough for women or overseas trained specialists ) while inflating their fees and charges to ensure massive incomes . <p> As reported in Pro Bono Australia News two weeks ago , the Productivity Commission has decided we could do with more competition in six areas : <p> social housing <p> public hospital services <p> specialist palliative care <p> public dental services <p> human services in remote Indigenous communities <p> grant-based family and community services . <p> Contrary to some reports , CCA is not opposed to all competition or consumer choice and will be seeking guidance from its members in relation to these recommendations . <p> The CCA submission in response to the PC preliminary report will also be asking for a more detailed rationale as to why the most obvious cases where competition has been shown to deliver better outcomes , like pharmacy services , do not even rate a mention in this report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Community Council for Australia .

 Future Generations of , 6th October 2016 at 2:32 pm <p> The 2016 Valuing Children Initiative benchmark survey has found that 80 per cent of Australians are concerned about the health and happiness of future generations of Australian children . <p> " Childhood obesity and mental health were highlighted as being particular issues of concern , " convenor of the Valuing Children Initiative Linda Savage said . <p> " In Australia today approximately one in four children are overweight or obese , and , as a result , for the first time children in affluent countries like Australia are predicted to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents , because of the chronic diseases that result . <p> " In 2013/14 almost one in seven , four to 17 year olds were assessed as having mental disorders in the previous 12 months .

" <p> The Valuing Children Initiative has also called for the instigation of a rigorous and transparent process to ensure that all policy , legislative and decision-making processes actively consider the impact on children and future generations . <p> " This would ensure that children , who can not vote and are excluded from influencing the political process , have their interests explicitly considered . Considering the impact on children and future generations should be integral to sound decision making , " Savage said.The Valuing Children Initiative has also called for funding of community awareness activities to inspire Australians to value all children , to understand that a child 's wellbeing is the responsibility of the entire community and ensure children are at the forefront of considerations . <h> Tech take over 
 Racing Ban a ' Devastating Blow ' for , 11th October 2016 at 5:12 pm <p> Not for profits are " bitterly disappointed " at the decision by the New South Wales Government to reverse the statewide ban on greyhound racing . <p> NSW Premier Mike Baird announced on Tuesday that the government would give greyhound racing " one final chance " under a new regime that promises " the strictest regulations that exist anywhere in the country " . <p> In an about-face , which comes just three months after the ban was first announced , Baird declared he had " got it wrong " . <p> " It 's clear the community agrees that the cruelty must end , but we underestimated the community 's desire to give the greyhound industry one last chance to reform and conform to the highest standards of animal welfare , " Baird said . <p> " The industry ca n't return to the status quo the barbaric practices of live baiting , cruel wastage and high rates of injury must end . " <p> Deputy premier Troy Grant said the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greyhound racing . <p> " Regional communities value the greyhound industry and we 've heard loud and clear that they believe it deserves another chance , " Grant said . <p> However the government is now facing backlash over the decision with thousands of people taking to the premier 's Facebook page on Tuesday to express their anger , with some calling him " spineless " and " a disgrace " . <p> World Animal Protection head of campaigns in Australia Nicola Beynon said , on behalf of the greyhounds in NSW , they were " bitterly disappointed " with the announcement . <p> Voiceless head of communications Elise Burgess said the move would do " irreparable political damage " to the NSW premier . <p> " The fact is , the majority of people supported this ban two out of three according to RSPCA Australia polling statistics so despite the cheers of victory from those with vested interests , most Australians will be very disappointed with this outcome , " Burgess said . <p> " We now know that live baiting , doping , and the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greyhound racing industry that no amount of legislative or policy change can regulate them away . <p> " Just yesterday there were new reports of mass graves of slaughtered greyhounds , evidence of corruption and live baiting by officials , the arrest of a Cabramatta trainer for live baiting and the torture of animals this industry is not going to change . And why would it ? <p> " The industry has been exposed for its cruelty , and it has gotten away with it scot-free . " <p> Burgess said the Special Commission Report , which prompted the ban , found that up to 20 per cent of trainers in NSW engaged in live baiting . <p> " The report also found that almost 500 greyhounds sustained major or fatal injuries during races each year , and that up to 68,000 healthy animals have been treated as ' wastage ' in NSW alone , " Burgess said . <p> " Despite having years to clean up its act , to eliminate the ingrained cruelty and redeem itself , evidence of abuse is still being reported in 2016 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change its ways . Another industry commitment , more meaningless regulations , will not result in reform . The culture of cruelty is just too systemic , and the ' wastage ' unavoidable . <p> " This was an opportunity for Australia to join the vast majority of nations who have banned this sport because of cruelty . Instead , we are left in the dark ages , one of just eight nations who continue greyhound racing . " <p> Meanwhile Baird has announced former Labor premier Morris Iemma will chair a Greyhound Industry Reform Panel to advise government on the shape of a new regime , which will include mandatory life bans as well as increased jail terms for live baiting . <p> The RSPCA , and industry and government representatives have been invited to join the five-person panel . <p> Subject to the panel 's recommendations , legislation would be introduced early in 2017 to repeal the ban and deliver the new regime .@@14800847 <p> The New South

Such is NFP directors ' passion for the mission of their organisations , whether that be the local surf club or a world-renowned gallery , that they want to get stuck in and help out . This enthusiasm though comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day-to-day operations of an NFP , it can mean they have less time to turn to questions of the wider strategy of the organisation . <p> Setting strategy for any board is one of its most vital functions . To achieve their missions over the long term , it is critical our NFP boards feel that they have sufficient time to devote to strategic planning . However , the latest AICD NFP Governance and Performance Study paints a worrying picture of the capacity of directors to do the necessary strategic thinking and planning in an environment where NFPs ' resources are constrained . <p> Most directors surveyed for the study recognised the importance of strategy , but many reported their focus was still drawn too much to short-term or operational issues . While nearly all directors ( 90 per cent ) had undertaken some sort of training in the last year , a minority ( 40 per cent ) received training in strategic planning . Many respondents in the study considered a lack of skills and experience in strategy available to boards represented a major challenge for the NFP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two most common areas directors named where their boards could improve . <p> Many of the directors in the AICD study described their NFP and board as having a culture of " survival " . <p> The attention of directors is taken up by short-term exigencies because many feel that they are constrained by the " hand-to-mouth existence " of their organisations . Many of the directors in the AICD study described their NFP and board as having a culture of " survival " . The reliance of their organisations on grants and donations leads to planning that is by necessity short term and risk averse , the NFP directors reported . The feeling that the future of their organisations is outside of their locus of control limits the ability of boards to properly focus on long-term strategy . <p> Policy changes are also putting a strain on the time and energy of NFP boards . The introduction of National Disability Insurance Scheme and Client Directed Care should both ultimately be of great benefit to beneficiaries of services , but adapting to the changes is a major drain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of NFPs it is the first time they will have needed to think about the marketing of their services . It will involve a complete re-think of many NFPs ' business models with the need to understand cash flow implications and have a much better knowledge of their unit costs . These are obviously key questions for boards of those NFPs , but again take time away from other important strategic issues that they could be addressing . <p> The way forward <p> There is no magic wand that will give NFP boards the capacity they need to address strategic issues . But there are steps the sector can take to correct the gap in strategic thinking . NFPs must be proactive in making sure in their succession planning they are bringing in directors with strategic planning experience . It is important directors also take personal responsibility for raising the standard of their board 's skills by extending their own abilities . <p> The sector as a whole needs to advocate for effective policy with more certain funding so that boards are freed up to concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from government for the NFP sector with a 12-month notice period of the termination of a contract . This would alleviate the anxiety many directors of NFPs feel about the financial sustainability and very solvency of their organisations . Under the conditions that exist now with much funding being short term , it is understandable that directors feel frustrated they ca n't turn their attention to long-term strategy . <p> The most effective boards control their organisation 's future through strong and thorough strategic planning . Given how important NFPs are to the health of our communities , it is unacceptable that so many directors feel at the moment that they ca n't give the time and attention they need to strategy . The first step to this changing is for the sector to face up to the problem and for boards to explicitly discuss how they can make strategy one of their main priorities . <h> Swan attacks BHP

" <p> The fellowships , set to start in 2017 , will be established by a US$50 million ( A$65 million ) grant from The Atlantic Philanthropies , while up to $40 million in Commonwealth support will be provided over the life of the program . <p> The estimated program value over 20 years will total more than $160 million , with additional financial contributions from the University of Melbourne , Queensland University of Technology and the University of Auckland . <p> President and CEO of The Atlantic Philanthropies , Christopher Oechsli said the initiative represented one of the foundation 's " final big bets " , and they were honored to welcome Australia into an interconnected set of Atlantic Fellows programs . <p> " Atlantic and its founding chairman , Chuck Feeney , have long invested in the people and future of Australia by supporting brilliant scientists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a world-class knowledge economy , " Oechsli said . <p> " It is now our distinct privilege to support innovative , dedicated leaders and organisations that will commit themselves to build opportunities for those who have been historically and systematically denied them , and to create a fairer , more inclusive and just future for all in the region and beyond . " <p> Fellows will be selected from a diverse range of backgrounds , such as business , academia , public service and industry , and chosen on the basis of their experience , impact and established commitment to social equity ideals , especially those focused on Indigenous communities . <p> Each fellow will complete an intensive curriculum focused on the development of forward-thinking leadership skills and social action strategies . The program will continue to evolve and adapt through input from Indigenous and non-Indigenous stakeholders throughout its duration . <p> Professor Glyn Davis , University of Melbourne 's vice-chancellor , said the Atlantic Fellows arrived at an important time , and would help build capability in a new generation of leaders . <p> " Our leadership styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis said . <p> " The approach that the fellowships will seek to embed in the next generation of social-change leaders will build on indigenous leadership paradigms that are ideally suited to promoting collaboration ; between other fellows , amongst those in the wider Atlantic Philanthropies network and beyond . <p> " In an increasingly interconnected world , such collaboration is not just a happy byproduct of this leadership program , it is essential . <p> " These fellowships will provide mid-career , social change leaders with a significant platform to accelerate their personal and professional development .

The inescapable conclusion is that the abuse and anguish that constitutes the daily reality of refugees and asylum-seekers on Nauru is the express intention of the Government of Australia . <p> " In furtherance of a policy to deter people arriving in Australia by boat , the Government of Australia has made a calculation in which intolerable cruelty and the destruction of the physical and mental integrity of hundreds of children , men and women , have been chosen as a tool of government policy . In so doing the Government of Australia is in breach of international human rights law and international refugee law . " <p> The Amnesty claims come after an ABC Four Corners report on Monday in which former teachers working with children 's aid agency Save the Children detailed cases of depression and self harm by young refugee children and teenagers on Nauru . <p> Anna Neistat , Amnesty International 's senior director for research , is said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate human rights abuses . <p> " On Nauru , the Australian Government runs an open-air prison designed to inflict as much suffering as necessary to stop some of the world 's most vulnerable people from trying to find safety in Australia , " Neistat said . <p> She said , based on months of research , including interviews with more than 100 people in Nauru and Australia , Amnesty International 's report brought together further revelations of abuse to reveal the full scale of Australia 's system of deliberate cruelty . <p> Self-harm on Nauru .

And suffer they have -- it has been devastating and , in some cases , irreparable . <p> " What we are seeing is the Australian Government going to extraordinary lengths to hide the daily despair of the people on Nauru . In doing so , they have misled the Australian public and the world by failing to admit that their border control policy depends on the deliberate and systematic abuse of thousands of people . Abuse is never a solution . " <p> Amnesty International has called on the Australian Government to immediately close down the Nauru and Manus processing operations . <p> " People are driven to the absolute brink , largely because they 're trapped on Nauru and are facing debilitating uncertainty about their future , " Neistat said . <p> " Nearly all of the people whom Amnesty International spoke to including young children on Nauru in July 2016 reported mental health issues of some kind .

 ' Hidden Crisis ' of Homelessness and Older , 18th October 2016 at 11:44 am <p> Not-for-profit organisations are joining forces to address a knowledge gap around an increasing number of older women experiencing homelessness . <p> The St Vincent de Paul Society NSW is bringing a group of experts together to tackle what the welfare charity describes as " the hidden crisis of homelessness facing older women " as part of its annual Rosalie Rendu lecture . ( It will be held on 20 October during Anti-Poverty Week ) . <p> Susan Ryan AO , former commissioner for age discrimination , will deliver the keynote speech based on her experience addressing disadvantage among older women . Experts from different social welfare and housing agencies will join a panel and audience discussions on the plight facing older women . <p> President of St Vincent de Paul Society NSW Denis Walsh , said there is a vacuum of information and research on the issues facing older women and homelessness . <p> " The Rosalie Rendu lecture this year is providing a platform for all of us in the social welfare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions , " Walsh said . <p> " Vinnies has developed a comprehensive Right to Home campaign to address issues around housing affordability . <p> " We will be launching a petition on the night calling on the NSW Government to change planning laws so that at least 15 per cent of new residential developments are set aside for affordable housing . " <p> Vinnies said 59 per cent of Australians seeking help from homelessness services are women , significantly higher than the UK 's 26 per cent and the USA 's 38 per cent . <p> " Thirty-six per cent of these women have been affected by domestic violence and it is the number one reason why they seek support from Vinnies and other specialist homelessness services , " Walsh said . <p> Mission Australia 's CEO Catherine Yeomans warned that without an increase in appropriate affordable housing , the numbers of vulnerable older women without a safe place to live would continue to climb in Australia . <p> " We know from our services and the wider sector that this is a growing problem , " Yeomans said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Specialist Homelessness Services : homeless clients 2011-12 to 2014-15 <p> The CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society NSW Jack de Groot told Pro Bono Australia News that the data on older women is not comprehensive . <p> " What we do know is that many older women are coming out of relationships and are facing a vulnerability after often very productive lives , " de Groot said . <p> " They are also usually in lower paid jobs and now , as they face failing health , redundancy or retirement , they find they can no longer afford to pay escalating rents in the private rental market . These women struggle to keep a roof over their head . " <p> He said more research needed to be done into the systemic issues that lead to homelessness for older women and what are the ways forward for the sector to engage with these women and provide wrap around services for them . <p> " Application and research into their stories is crucial . When we talk about a ' right to home ' we are not just talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with women and how they can best move forward . " <p> de Groot said most of these older women have never received Centrelink benefits before , so this process is difficult for them , and it was made a lot harder because they experienced a loss of dignity . <p> " When they finally reach out for help there are fewer targeted services available to them , leaving them to fall through the cracks . Gaining access to social housing is difficult for older women because they are rarely given priority status , " he said . <p> " The lack of affordable housing and the impact it is having on older women as they leave employment and relationships require a whole-of-government response and collaboration within the sector . If we can get 10,000 signatures then the petition can be brought to parliament for action to be taken . " <h> WNBA says officials 
 in Charitable Giving Dips for the First TimeWednesday , 19th October 2016 at 12:26 pm <p> The rate of charitable giving in Australia has fallen for the first time following a spike in the previous year and evidence of ongoing cautious consumerism , according to new research . <p> The NAB Charitable Giving Index shows the overall rate of giving to charity fell by 0.3 per cent , down from growth of 5.1 per cent a year earlier . <p> The index said the drop was in line with softening retail sales growth over the past 12 months , a post-mining boom adjustment in some state economies and a reluctance by consumers to spend on other " non-essentials " , including eating out , entertainment and major household items . <p> However , the index found that despite the contraction , the average donation size remained the same at $348 per donor . <p> Older Australians continued to give more than younger generations with those over the age of 65 the most generous in terms of both dollars donated and the rate of growth in giving ( 2 per cent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old fell by 3.9 per cent . <p> " The economic environment is having an impact on the rate of donations with more cautious consumer sentiment and the end of the mining boom impacting on the rate of giving , " NAB economist Rob de Iure said . <p> " The index has also been impacted by the lower incidence of highly visible and emotive humanitarian campaigns such as that which followed the Nepalese earthquake in 2015 which impacted giving to humanitarian services , which have historically had the largest market share of charitable giving . " <p> With an average donation size of $340 , Bellevue Hill in NSW for the first time became the suburb making the highest average donation , toppling Middle Park in Victoria and Mosman in NSW where average donation size was $318 and $291 respectively . <p> In terms of giving as a percentage of income , Castlemaine in Victoria continues to lead the country for generosity , donating 0.36 per cent of their annual incomes , closely followed by Sturt in South Australia with 0.35 per cent , Blaxland in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fitzroy North in Victoria and O'Connor in the ACT with 0.33 per cent . <p> The index showed that humanitarian services continued to enjoy the largest market share of charitable giving , accounting for 33 per cent of all donations , but the rate of growth of this sector has been in decline in recent months . <p> On the other hand , charitable lotteries now account for 15 per cent of donations followed by health and disability at 12 per cent and community services and children and families were the next biggest at 11 per cent . <p> NAB 's associate director of government , education and community business banking , Tim Hardy , told Pro Bono Australia News the index reflected what he saw happening in the market . <p> " We are seeing the impact of technology-driven changes such as a rise in the rate of giving via charitable lotteries , many of which are conducted in whole or in part via online platforms , " Hardy said . <p> " This is certainly creating digital disruption to traditional giving . Online lotteries are appearing everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying them to support a cause as well as win a new house . <p> " We continue to work with the not-for-profit sector and business to respond to changes in economic conditions and innovate to respond to digital and other disruption and to diversify revenue streams , building a vibrant and sustainable sector for future generations . " <p> Hardy said there was no clear indication of why there was a drop in donations from younger people aged 25 to 34 . <p> " I think we are seeing that younger people being more responsive to immediate giving such as to international disasters like the Nepalese earthquake , " he said . <p> " This has been the first regressive result since we started the giving index so we are not yet seeing a downward trend . This is just a snap shot and often reflects how well the economy is doing . Those organisations that are ahead of the curve will stay ahead . " <p> National charity , the Heart Research Institute said the NAB Giving Index provided some food for thought for the sector and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors and keep regular donors . <p> " We are a little worried about consumer sentiment without getting political . I feel like consumer sentiment is n't too strong at the moment so that is a little bit of a concern but beyond that I think that the not-for-profit space in Australia is very competitive , there is a lot of activity in this market now and so I do n't think it 's going to get any easier to fundraise in the year 's ahead , " head of global fundraising and branding Richard Wylie told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " In fact I think it is going to get a bit more challenging . It 's really a case of us not resting on our laurels and we need to be looking at lower cost channels and more innovative ways of connecting with donors and not relying on the third parties that we 've traditionally relied on in the past . <p> " Any forward thinking not-for-profit organisation in Australia has to be spending significant time and energy looking at different channels . At the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 10 years and around the world has been regular giving . <p> " We know the benefits that come with donors that have made a commitment to support that is ongoing so face-to-face fundraising continues to get more expensive , telemarketing gets more expensive ... for us we are changing channels of acquisition that are more cost effective for our organisation ... so for me that is why digital is such an exciting proposition . " <p> Wylie said that in the last few years everyone has probably had a positive experience with peer-to-peer fundraising . <p> " The area we are really excited about is in basically in-house lead generation so again data is key where that 's names and addresses or emails to contact people to encourage them into single giving or regular giving data is the key . " <p> The NAB Giving Index found an upsurge in funds raised from lotteries in South Australia . <p> " I think a lotteries program is an important part of our portfolio so lottery players are slightly different to traditional donors . They enjoy games of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate our different donor groups , " Wylie said . <p> " Traditionally South Australia and Western Australia had been difficult markets to run lotteries from a regulatory point of view and so the feeling is what 's happened over there in the last 12 months is that the regulators have gotten in step with other state regulators and it has made it easier to run large scale lotteries there and that is why we are seeing a spyke in that market . " Because of the South Australian report I am certainly going to direct our lottery agents to take a greater interest in South Australia that 's for sure . " <h> First shipment of

" <p> He said there would be an argument about whether in fact they were independent contractors . <p> " Our clients say that ca n't be the case because they rely on the fact that they were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend meetings and work long hours , " he said . <p> " Part of the activities concerned people who did not meet their sales targets and it 's the view of the clients that these activities meant that they were a more compulsory activity if you want to be part of the Appco group rather than something someone can voluntarily go by . " <p> He said the not-for-profit organisations would have contracted with Appco which would have then driven the private fundraising activities . <p> " Not all charities use the Appco service arrangement . " <p> He said the service arrangement however did affect a number of large and well known charities . <p> " What I know is that the lead claimant Mr Jacob Bywater acted for Surf Life Saving Australia , the Paralympic Association and also the Allanah and Madeline Foundation . They were three of the larger clients . <p> " At Appco he was a team leader in the Appco model . His role was to administer a team of 20 fundraisers to effectively raise money for these charities . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual charities who are clients of Appco to ensure that they are meeting their guidelines . <p> " We simply know of the relationship between the individual worker and Appco . " <p> The Fundraising Institute Australia CEO Rob Edwards told Pro Bono Australia News he was aware the case was on the horizon . <p> " In the end what I would say is that charities have to enter into agreement with their suppliers that are in accordance with industrial relations laws . <p> " In the end it is the charity 's brand that 's at stake and it reflects poorly on the sector . " <p> Earlier this month the Fair Work Ombudsman announced an an investigation into the fundraising practices of some major Australian charities . <p> It said it would randomly investigate seven charities with an annual income of more than $1 million , five charities with an annual income of more than $250,000 and three charities with annual incomes below $250,000 . <p> The workplace watchdog said it would scrutinise their labour procurement and supply chain practices . <p> It emphasised that charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies they outsource fundraising to , even if lax governance arrangements mean charities were unaware of the situation . <p> Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell said they had been monitoring charities ' use of face-to-face fundraising , tele-fundraising and door knocking for some time . <p> CHICAGO -- Back 
 of , 24th October 2016 at 9:17 am <p> Dr Michael Cavanagh is the deputy head of Coaching Psychology Unit at the University of Sydney and was a key contributor to The Helmsman Project . He is this week 's Changemaker . <p> The Helmsman Project is a not-for profit organisation running adventure-based coaching programs with the aim of helping students from disadvantaged communities develop critical life skills that will help them achieve their potential and avoid entry into the welfare system . <p> Cavanagh , a leading researcher in the field of coaching psychology , was a key contributor to the development of the innovative coaching program , which is complemented by a longitudinal randomised control trial . <p> He has more than 20 years experience in facilitating personal , group and organisational change . <p> And he has designed and facilitated training and personal development workshops in Australia and internationally , for a diverse range of entities including government , mining , media , brewing , financial services and legal organizations . <p> Cavanagh has also led the world 's largest coaching research project into leadership development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of early intervention , disrupting learned helplessness , and the truth behind the saying " it takes a village to raise a child " . <p> How did you get involved with The Helmsman Project ? <p> Through the two founders of the project , John Naylor and Andrew Stainer ... I taught them at Sydney University . I am the deputy director of the Coaching Psychology Unit at Sydney University , and they asked me to come along and head up the coaching working group . <p> How can early intervention disrupt the cycle of disadvantage ? <p> So , one of the things that the cycle of disadvantage does is it inculcates a sense of hopelessness and inability to make a difference in people . So when people feel like nothing they do makes a difference , then they do nothing . It 's a process called learned helplessness . <p> Early intervention can disrupt that learning . If you can help people notice that when challenges come and setbacks arise , they can be resolved , and that through self-regulation and setting goals , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it tends to help make them more resilient into the future . It disrupts the learned helplessness . <p> Why does The Helmsman Project target Year 9 students in particular ? <p> What the research suggests is that the earlier the age that you can make the shift , the more effective is the shift . Research shows that Year 9 is a critical age for young people . The attitudes they develop and decisions they make during this time have profound implications for their future education and employment . <p> In some senses , Year 9 students are a bit harder to work with than older children because they are a little less self-regulated than older children . However , changes that you make at this age , can have a bigger impact . <p> What are the benefits of an adventure-based coaching program ? <p> One of the ways that you can build hope , self-regulation and resilience , is by putting people in situations that are outside their normal comfort zone , if you like , outside their normal experience ; and that 's anxiety producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety is we try to avoid it ; in adventure education , you ca n't avoid it . The problem with avoiding things is that you never learn that you can overcome them . For this reason , the adventure education is an integral part of this process . It 's about placing kids in situations where they are outside their comfort zone so that they can learn that they have the capacity to meet a wider range of situations , challenges and complexity , and still be successful . <p> The delivery of The Helmsman Project is complemented by a longitudinal randomised control trial which you oversee along with Professor Herb Marsh . What results are you seeing from the program ? <p> The data we have collected so far has n't been analysed yet . We are still in the process of collecting data . However , the anecdotal evidence , and some qualitative studies that we 're doing , suggest that the young people , particularly when they have met challenges that are well outside their comfort zone , they experience themselves as being much more capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , amongst those who have participated . some go on to become school captains in later years , so that 's some anecdotal evidence that what The Helmsman Project is doing is having a positive impact . We 've also had some anecdotal evidence from teachers , principals and parents who have identified significant changes for the better in their kids . <p> One parent thanked us for " giving them back their child " . Some other young people show major changes in things like the level of detention and disciplinary issues that they are having . <p> What is the ultimate goal ? <p> The ultimate goal in this work , in my view , is to help create what I would like to call Helmsman Villages . You know the old saying " it takes a village to raise a child " . So a lot of our world at the moment is very individualised , we focus on individuals , and part of what this program is about is helping people notice the power of working together , collaboration and networks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So part of my dream for the program is that both the participants and the schools that are involved start to develop that sort of focus on networks . That 's why one of the critical parts of the program is what we call the community project . The kids actually work on something that is not just for their benefit but is something that gives back to the world and usually involves them getting in touch with and working with others . <p> Who or what inspires you ? <p> This is sort of a hard question to answer . In terms of this specific work , helping people to see themselves more positively , to see the opportunities , the potential that is embedded within them particularly when they work with others , that 's the thing that is inspiring for me . <p> What are you reading at the moment ? <p> Interestingly , I am reading a book on robotisation and automation , and it is called Humans Need Not Apply . That 's really looking at the way complex adaptive systems in society unfold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and it 's this : " The quality of the conversation determines the quality of the relationships and the quality of the relationships determines the quality of the system " . <p> It helps just to notice , I think , how we actually create systems of all sorts from marriages through to organisations . We do it through the way we talk and what we talk about , and focusing on that can be quite helpful . <p> Lewis Hamilton admits 
 the foundation , Don Yates , told Pro Bono Australia News : " The removal of the charity status of the Village Green Community Foundation will not greatly affect the operations of the foundation . " <p> He said the organisation 's activities included the maintenance of an information website called Mining Families . The website offers wellbeing and other health related information to mining families in Western Australia . <p> " The heavy handed withdrawal of charity status after some 24 years of helping people is just a bit clumsy . It is related to the ATO and the narrow minded small number of people who would shut the door just because they can , " Yates said . <p> Yates is a former councillor for the city of Bassendean in Perth . <p> Assistant commissioner David Locke said while the ACNC could not provide further details , the ACNC 's approach to regulating Australia 's charity sector had to be firm , yet fair . <p> However , Locke told the Senate Estimates Committee last week that the regulator was concerned about the strict nature of the ACNC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to say that we are ourselves concerned that the privacy provisions make it very difficult for us to answer questions , " Locke told the hearing . <p> " They also makes it difficult for us to actually explain to the community the steps that we are taking to protect trust and confidence and to address issues of malfeasance . But that is the legislation we have at the moment and have to enforce . <p> " But that is the legislation we have at the moment and have to enforce . " <p> Locke said on Wednesday about the Village Green Community Foundation revocation : " Where possible , we work with charities to help them get back on track . <p> " We do this by providing education , guidance and support . However , in some instances , the only appropriate course of action is to revoke charity status . <p> " Much of the ACNC 's compliance activity is the result of information provided by members of the public . <p> " On average , we receive 60 concerns each month , and around two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 has asked the Australian Law Reform Commission ( ALRC ) to inquire into what has been described as " the catastrophic " levels of Indigenous incarceration in Australia . <p> The Turnbull government wants the ALRC to examine the factors leading to the over representation of Indigenous Australians in the prison system , and consider what reforms to the law could ameliorate this national tragedy . <p> Attorney General George Brandis said it had been 25 years since the final report of the landmark Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody , but Indigenous Australians were still overrepresented in Australia 's prisons . <p> " In 1991 , Indigenous Australians made up 14 per cent of our nation 's prison population ; by 2015 , this had increased to 27 per cent , " Brandis said . <p> " Other worrying statistics include the fact that Indigenous children and teenagers are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated than their non-Indigenous peers , while Indigenous women are 30 times more likely to be incarcerated . <p> " The ALRC 's inquiry is a critical step for breaking through these disturbing trends.The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indigenous Australians , state and territory governments who have primary responsibility for our criminal justice frameworks , as well as the broader legal profession . " <p> Brandis said the government had committed $256 million in 2016/17 through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy for activities to address the drivers and improve community safety . <p> The Law Council of Australia said it had thrown its support behind the government 's decision to inquire into the catastrophic levels of Indigenous incarceration in Australia . <p> Law Council of Australia president Stuart Clark AM said the government 's decision to refer Indigenous incarceration to the ALRC was timely and important . <p> " As a result we have seen Indigenous imprisonment rates skyrocket . Twenty-five years ago Indigenous peoples were being imprisoned at seven times the rate of the broader population , today it 's 14 times . This is nothing short of a national catastrophe . <p> " Indigenous people represent just 2.5 per cent of the population , but 27 per cent of the prison population . Indigenous children represent 50 per cent of those in juvenile detention .

This issue will remain an ongoing priority for the Law Council in 2017 and beyond . " <h> This Scary Weather 
 says it will introduce a law ensuring that genuine refugees who have arrived in Australia by boat via smuggling syndicates will never be allowed to enter Australia in the future . <p> However , the move is set to be vigorously fought by Australian refugee advocates , including the possibility of a high court challenge . <p> The prime minister and the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , announced the full details Sunday , saying they wanted to send a very strong message to the criminal people smuggling syndicates that we will not allow them to find an illegal pathway for people to Australia . <p> Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the bill would apply to all asylum seekers taken to a regional processing centre since 19 July 2013 . <p> " This bill will reflect the government 's long-standing position and as we understand it , the bipartisan position initially set out you Labor , " Turnbull said . <p> Before the official announcement , Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told ABC Insiders that those who have paid people smugglers will not be resettled in Australia . <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nauru , if they are found to be owed protection , they will not be resettled in Australia . If they 're not found to be owed protection , they should return home , " Bishop said . <p> " This is a tough message we are sending to the people smuggling syndicates and those who pay people smugglers to try and enter Australia . <p> When asked what the policy said about freedom of movement around the globe as a basic human right , Bishop said : " They wo n't be settled in Australia and they wo n't be visiting Australia . It is a tough message . We have to stop the people smuggling syndicates . <p> " I will never forget 1,200 people that we know of drowned at sea coming to Australia under these people smuggling networks . We can not have situations where people are drowning at sea and that is why we are working through the case load , the cohort of people who are on Manus and Nauru , to find third country resettlements for them and if they want to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " <p> However , the founder and CEO of the Asylum Seeker Refugee Council Kon Karapanagiotidis told Pro Bono Australia News the move was unprecedented and the refugee sector would do everything to block it including a high court challenge . <p> " No country in the industrialised world has ever passed such a law to permanently ban people from seeking protection . It is illegal . It is a breach of the refugee convention , " Karapanagiotidis said . <p> " It is so immoral and it shows what a desperate government this is knowing the profound impact that the Bring Them Here campaign has had in turning of the tide of community sentiment where the majority of Australian voters actually want the people on Nauru and Manus to be safely settled which includes being brought here . " <p> He said the move was akin to reintroducing the white Australia policy . <p> " You would have to think there would be a high court challenge . I do n't see how it can be constitutional to do such a thing . You would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . It is like White Australia policy ... pure White Australia policy all over again , " Karapanagiotidis said . <p> " We would be very much up to fighting this because this can not possibly be legal . To ban a group of people from entering Australia on the basis of what ... on their mode of arrival , on the basis of their race ? How could it possibly be legal ? " <p> He said the refugee sector would be starting with a campaign to the crossbenchers in the senate . <p> " I think there is wonderful momentum within our sector we would be thinking to work very quickly with the sector with the rest of the refugee movement to get the senate to block this , " he said . <p> " We will hit the ground running immediately because this is unacceptable .

 bodies in Western Australia have merged in what is seen as a first for the state . <p> The Association for Western Australian Community Resource Centres ( ) voted unanimously at their recent AGM to merge with , the peak body for Neighbourhood Centres ( NCs ) in WA . <p> The organisations said the idea of a merger was first considered more than two years ago , when was approached by the board of the , which operated as an unfunded peak body overseen by a volunteer board promoting community resource centres ( CRCs ) . <p> " Staying in the same model was very early ruled out as an option , as delivery of services by an unfunded association is very limited , " chair of the board Lee Steel said . <p> " It is dependent upon volunteers and the generosity of the CRCs they were employed by . Instead of being a reactive board , there was a clear need to be proactive . There is no doubt that merging with would allow this to happen .

WA came out so badly in that , and as local services and local communities we feel that our members have a very important role to play in addressing those issues . <p> " What both boards were really passionate about , and what was why we chose each other , was because we wanted to make sure we represented those local services for the local communities rather than just merging with a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chilcott said that another benefit for the merger was that by becoming part of , their new members have access to a national body , the Australian Neighbourhood Houses and Centres Association ( ) and therefore have a voice of a national policy level . <p> " Very few members have DGR or PBI status but through they can have access to the DGR fund , which means they can apply for philanthropic grants that they would n't have been able to access otherwise .

According to last Morning Herald , the Baird government is on the verge of embracing affordable housing targets in Sydney 's six district plans to be announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be needed , developers may be obligated to include an affordable component within all new housing schemes on re-zoned land . This could be a game changer for the tens of thousands of Sydneysiders forced into housing stress in our overheated market . <p> As reported , affordable housing targets under the new regime may be in the region of 5 to 10 per cent of floor space . That 's a whole lot better than zero ! But looking to similar policies , as operated in comparable cities like London and New York , the federation will continue to argue for higher figures especially for developments on government land . <p> More importantly , we will be lobbying hard to ensure that the rules of any new system result in a meaningful reform and not just a grand-sounding but empty gesture . Critically , these rules will need to be broadly applicable and will need to specify that " affordable housing " means rental homes available at a sub-market price in perpetuity . We know that others will be pressing for a narrowly targeted regime with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's need for100,000 new social and affordable homes by 2036 ( 50,000 by 2026 ) and given the derisory level of affordable housing construction currently ongoing , no single policy is going to yield enough to crack this problem . To its credit , the government has already pledged some expansion of supply over the next few years through the premier 's Social and Affordable Housing Fund and through the communities plus estate renewal program . But with existing commitments promisinga net addition of only around 9,000 social and affordable homes over the next decade , a huge challenge remains . <p> The seriousness of the current housing situation is not lost on the wider public . Following the federal election the Essential Poll ranked housing affordability in the top five issues Australians believe need addressing in the next year above education , climate change and even so-called budget repair . And in a recent poll for the Federation , Essential found 80 per cent favouring a government requirement that every new residential development contains some affordable housing . <p> Here in Sydney we 've been witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing supply within existing city limits . In May it was the Sydenham to renewal corridor project signalling 36,000 new apartments . Then in September thenew masterplan for Sydney Olympic Park heralded 10,000 new homes . In expanding overall housing numbers these developments are all well and good . As announced , though , there has beenno mention that these projects will incorporate any affordable housing . For the good of our city this has to be put right . <p> From a development viewpoint , the financial challenge of building affordable housing is a lot about what you need to pay for land , rather than actual build costs . When developing in an area like Parramatta , for example , community housing providers estimate that buying a site will absorb half the total housing scheme budget . <p> And it 's largely through land price inflation , not through rising builder charges that the overall cost of housing development has been going through the roof over the past few years . Sydney land priceshave risen by 74 per cent since 2010 . That 's why " affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routinely operate in the UK , they effectively lock in a supply of low cost or free-of-charge land for affordable housing development . <p> As seen in NSW parliamentary debates last month , some on the government side continue to claim that " expanding supply " is a magic bullet for all housing ills . One speaker recited the that the problem is " really a simple case of supply and demand " . Nevertheless , we remain hopeful that government ministers recognise that expanding overall housing output must be complemented by a range of direct interventions to expand social and affordable housing accessible to lower income Australians . <p> As a landowner , government to set an example with ambitious affordable housing targets on its major land holdings slated for disposal , such as regeneration sites like the Bays Precinct . <p> Government incentives to trigger investment in affordable housing such as through expanding the Social and Affordable Housing Fund through designating a fraction of the stamp duty bonanza seen since 2011 . <p> We 've been hearing for many months now that the NSW Government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront the growing problem . Given the seriousness of the situation it has been a frustrating wait . On the other hand we fully appreciate the complexities that will need to be overcome to ensure any reforms are meaningful .

" <p> One of Victoria 's largest not-for-profit homelessness service organisations , Launch Housing described the package as " fantastic " . <p> Deputy CEO Dr Heather Holst told Pro Bono Australia News the announcement was very pleasing because it targeted rough sleepers and people living in care who were at risk of homelessness . <p> " We are particularly excited about it being directed to the rough sleepers and young people living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news because that is one of the ways people come into homelessness , " Holst said . <p> " For Launch Housing the most exciting part is the funding for the Family Supportive Housing Project which is something we have been planning and working on for some years now and that 's really exciting to have definite funding coming into that . <p> " The government has responded to the spike in rough sleeping that we have seen with some pretty quick action here . It is hard for government to move quickly enough on large scale problems but it is really pleasing to see how seriously they are taking this . <p> " We are starting to have talks with the government . When you are building houses , which the families project will be ding , it takes longer .

 the Forgotten Corners of Our , 14th November 2016 at 10:07 am <p> Arthur Alla is the founder of Red Earth Connections , a reconciliation champion and , as of last week , the 2017 NSW Young Australian of the Year . He is this week 's Changemaker . <p> While volunteering for a year in Cape York , Alla listened to the stories of elders and traditional owners and decided to help other young people to have the same opportunity to connect with Indigenous Australia . <p> In 2011 , he set up Red Earth , a not-for-profit organisation that gives Indigenous Australians from remote homelands a way to host high school students so they can learn about their country , culture and way of life . <p> Since it was founded Red Earth has led over 1,000 young people to Cape York , Central Australia and Arnhem Land , contributed 25,000 hours of labour to infrastructure projects in the homelands of those regions , and raised over half a million dollars for remote Indigenous Australia . <p> In this week 's Changemaker , Alla talks about how being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the opportunity to tell their story and why we must bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia . <p> What motivated you to set up Red Earth Connections in 2011 ? <p> My father is from Algeria and my mum was born in France and they brought me to Australia when I was eight , so I think I 've always kind of understood to some degree what it was like to be an outsider . And so that is something I 've always carried with me . <p> And I grew up and I went to a school where you had students going overseas , going to Cambodia , going to Vietnam , throughout the Pacific and South East Asia , and doing work there and learning about cultures there . But while we talked about Indigenous Australia in school we never really did much with it , we never really got the opportunity to make a difference there . And it is important to go overseas because we are global citizens but we are also Australian citizens . I think about 30,000 to 40,000 young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forgotten corners of our nation , with our First People . So that was something that always concerned me when I was in high school . <p> And probably the third thing that happened was that when I was 21 I was travelling in Nicaragua in Central America and I was going to volunteer at an orphanage in a little town on the west coast and I got in a fake cab and I ended up getting kidnapped for about 18 hours . It was terrifying , the fake taxi took a few turns and then everyone in the taxi pulled out knives and blindfolded me and my friend . And the whole ordeal lasted a really long time and there were sort of downtimes while they were trying to take money from our credit cards and I had a credit card that was n't working , so that was really scary . But the other thing is that during that time I actually got to speak to the people that were holding us captive and it was a bit of a wake up call I guess , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that no one grows up wanting to end up doing this sort of thing and so it really made me think about how far disadvantage can take people ... I think you end up having to rationalise it one way or another , you ca n't just live in constant anger , you know seeking revenge and to be able to make that connection and to feel some empathy even for someone who is holding a knife to your throat , I think that is part of the healing process . <p> So , I came back to Australia and we managed to get away in the end , although I really did n't think I was going to make it out of that experience , and I had a job lined up working as an economic consultant but I ended up , realising that it really was n't for me and I wanted to discover more about what was happening in remote Indigenous Australia . The full picture , not just the two dimensional picture you sometimes get in the media . So to my mum 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and I started knocking on doors until a place let me volunteer for them and then I ended up spending the best part of the year volunteering in this space and I had the chance to meet traditional owners and to meet elders who said to me " why are you the only young person here , why do n't more young people come and discover what 's going on right here in their own country " and I think there was a real sense from their perspective that they wanted to take control of the narrative that was being portrayed and to tell their own stories , on their own land and on their own terms . And so in a way I just channeled that and started contacting schools and a few schools eventually said " ok let 's give it a go " and then it really spread from there . First amongst the homelands in Cape York and then across to Arnhem Land and then down to Central Australia and you know Indigenous people hearing from word of mouth that this was possible and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . <p> Your work is deeply rooted in reconciliation , why is this important ? <p> I think at a fundamental level people are good-hearted people but we also have a tribal tendency , we paint people in either us or them , and in a democracy where you have a majority rule you have to have some shared values but also a lot of tolerance for other people 's values that may be different to yours . And that 's the case with what we consider our traditional western values and that 's the case with what we consider the values of our First People . And being able to learn to see ourselves in each other , the best and the worst , that 's how we build tolerance for our differences and that 's how we bridge our differences by seeing our common humanity and I think that 's the essence of reconciliation . <p> What are your current priorities ? <p> My priority is very simple and it is our mission , and it is to give every Indigenous person , man , woman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they so want it , to be able to host young people from cities and from non-Indigenous Australia onto their land and tell their own stories on their own terms . <p> What does a typical day for you look like at Red Earth Connections ? <p> So I spend a lot of time speaking to elders and traditional owners about what they want for their homeland and how we can make that happen . Both in practical terms and in terms of the stories they want to pass on to who they see as the leaders of tomorrow . So that is definitely part of it . A lot of time on the phone . <p> I also spend a lot of time in schools , trying to get the passion up amongst our high school students to not just think that Indigenous Australia is this boring thing in the classroom , but it 's actually a culture that is the oldest culture in the world and it 's still ongoing and still alive to this day , 40,000 years on . And that they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see something really special . So I also spend a lot of time speaking to high school students and trying to get them excited about their opportunities . <p> Do you find that high school students are responsive ? <p> I think so . And as with all things it is about your message and how you communicate it , and there are the right ways of doing it and there are the wrong ways of doing it . But in general , what I see in the schools that I go to I have spent time at schools in Brisbane , in Sydney , in Melbourne is that there is a real goodness and a real desire before talking about closing the gap , to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia and to see what is going on on the other side and to connect with people at a human level . <p> You are the 2017 NSW Young Australian of the Year . How does it feel to be recognised for the work you are doing ? <p> It is a double-edged sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is a little bit more attention than I 'm used to and I do n't necessarily love that , but at the same time what an incredible opportunity to have a platform and a megaphone to talk about these issues that I 've been working on for the majority of my adult life . Because at the end of the day yes , we want everyone to have the opportunity to thrive and the opportunity to do well , but we also want every Australian to have the opportunity to tell their story and have it be heard . <p> Do you consider yourself a role model for young Australians wanting to make a difference ? <p> I 'll leave that up to them . I am a fallen creature like everyone . But I followed my passion and it 's brought me here and I encourage every young person to do the same thing . And you know what , in fact , to not do it for recognition or supposed glory or whatever it may be , because that does n't exist . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments and if you can do something where you enjoy each and every day , and each and every day brings you something that you can be proud of and that you enjoy then that 's all that really matters . <p> Who or what inspires you ? <p> What inspires me is this notion of being able to live in a country where we have great diversity , all in this melting pot of different values , but also as I said before , a really high level of tolerance for each other where we see each other as three dimensional human beings and not as two dimensional cartoons and where no matter where people come from or what they look like or the size of their paycheck or the station into which they are born , we treat them as equals and promote their chance to thrive and to live a life to the fullest of their abilities . That is really important . <p> I see great stories in remote Indigenous Australia but I also see some really tough stories . There are eight-year-old girls that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mothers who have lost not one but two sons to suicide and those stories are common and the people who experience those stories , they are real people . It is always so easy to forget that and I think we should always keep that in mind . <p> What are you reading at the moment ? <p> I 'm re-reading Stan Grant 's book , Talking To My Country . It 's funny because Stan Grant was at the ceremony on Monday night and so I thought jeez I should re-read it . So I read it a little while ago and every time you re-read something even after a little while has passed you see different things . But it is not about liking it or not liking it or agreeing with it or not agreeing with it , because I think we have a duty to listen to each other and to open our hearts to each other and perhaps even more to people with whom we disagree than to people with whom we agree . <p> Do you have a favourite saying ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think life is beautiful and complex and I 'm not sure it can be reduced to slogans or sayings ... but a saying I like that I learned the other day : do n't believe everything you think . <h> Queensland battered by 
 Risk of Terrorism Financing by , 15th November 2016 at 10:04 am <p> The charity regulator is working with two national finance agencies to assess the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing facing the not-for-profit sector in Australia . <p> The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) , the Australian Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre ( AUSTRAC ) and the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) are undertaking the national risk assessment of charities and not-for-profit organisations . <p> The ACNC said the assessment , which includes a national survey of charities and not-for-profit organisations , would look at the key vulnerabilities and risk indicators of high-risk organisations . <p> According the ACNC charity register , more than 4,000 Australian charities operate overseas . <p> " The vast majority of charities operate with integrity and have sound governance practice ; however we know , from both international and Australian experience , that some charities can be vulnerable to financing terrorism and money laundering , particularly if they are operating in high-risk regions and do not have sound procedures in place , " ACNC assistant commissioner David Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ATO to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment of the not-for-profit sector .

It does n't take long and it will ensure that the voices and experiences of the sector are represented in this important piece of work . " <p> The ACNC said as well , the risk assessment would improve Australia 's adherence with international standards identified by the Financial Action Task Force ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering , the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . <p> In January 2016 the Indonesian Government intercepted more than $500,000 in charitable donations that were raised in Australia and allegedly transferred to Jakarta . <p> At the time Indonesia 's Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre ( PPATK ) worked with AUSTRAC to capture the money , which was reportedly raised by one Australian man . <p> chairman Muhammad Yusuf told Indonesian media that between 2010 and 2015 authorities identified 45 money transfers , totaling 5 billion rupiah ( A$500,000 ) in donations , which were allegedly being used to support terrorists and their families . <p> " We have identified that the money from Australia came from alms and donations from individuals in the country .

It urges us to expand our vision of what kind of country we want to create , arguing passionately in favour of going beyond economic indicators , to embed into all our public debate the importance of fostering a society that is kind , just , fair , inclusive , compassionate and courageous . " We are all much more than passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tim Costello , said . His formulation is memorable and timely , and prompts us to consider what kinds of responses would best promote these values . <p> In the domain of law , the ready response is to assume some form of regulation as the best way to ensure a fair , inclusive economy as the UK courts have just effectively done by declaring Uber drivers to be " employees " for the purposes of employment regulation . But it is equally important to keep our imagination open as to what " an economy " is , so that we can expand the toolbox of possible ways to foster a society of the kind the CCA calls for . Perhaps we might say , extending the passenger metaphor , " an economy is much more than a fast train from A to B " . From this perspective , business itself needs to incorporate the range of values highlighted by the CCA report and one creative legal reform that would help assist this is expanded professional legal support for small-scale , sustainable economy initiatives . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues and I argue that there is a gap in the existing professional legal support for small-scale sustainable economy initiatives . The paper draws on a three-year research project on legal and regulatory support structures in this area , two small surveys of social enterprise , a review of eight cognate initiatives , a review of law firm websites and direct contact with nine social enterprise-related capacity building programs around Australia . <p> In current debates about innovation and the new economy , there is much to be gained by focusing on the ways in which small-scale enterprises that place a high value on economic democracy , social relationships and community development in their organisational design can help respond to urgent economic and environmental challenges . But the legal , financial and organisational structures of our current economy do not sit comfortably with these types of initiatives . There is some existing support for them but its utility and scope is restricted by assumptions of a divide between not-for-profit and for-profit legal structures a divide that tends to result in a dearth of professional support outside of pro bono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . What if easily affordable and accessible legal advice and support for community enterprise existed as a common pool resource ? <p> There are three main sources of existing professional legal support for small-scale , sustainable economy initiatives . Some law firms provide advice to social enterprises , but most focus on not-for-profit and limited pro bono advice . However , recently some smaller firms are emerging with more of a creative and hybrid focus . There are also a number of cognate initiatives that service social enterprise specifically and in some cases , though they have various limitations of scope and resources . Finally , social enterprise capacity-building programs broker select initiatives to access legal advice , sometimes at " low-bono " fee levels . <p> Overall , pro bono legal practitioners appear to have access to well-developed networks to help them identify each other and to share knowledge . In contrast , those attempting to build their expertise and skills around working with social enterprises and small-scale sustainable economy initiatives report difficulty in identifying a network and limited opportunities to share knowledge and expertise around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those unmet needs as a basis for proposing four complementary pathways that would advance the development of an effective eco-system of professional legal support . These pathways are predominantly quite practical , focusing on providing development opportunities around technical skill sets , improving the accessibility and relevance of legal support available , and reducing cost barriers to the provision of support . These pathways would cultivate , most importantly a vital , yet elusive , sense of what we call " the touch " amongst community enterprise lawyers . " The touch " is a sensibility more than skill , grounded in a mix of shared values , especially economic democracy , community development , a holistic worldview and an understanding of how to meld social relationality with practical governance . It is partly experiential , embedded in tacit craft knowledge , and partly normative , linked to a set of ethical and political commitments , though not to any particular ideology . <p> The creation of a legal ecosystem designed to give advice that is relevant to small-scale sustainable economy initiatives is vital if we wish to foster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia . And in a legal profession that increasingly faces the disrupting influence of technological and economic change that underpins the contentious sharing economy , a pool of community enterprise lawyers could be a career path of both civil and practical significance for future lawyers . <p> About the author : Bronwen Morgan is a professor of law at UNSW and has been conducting a Future Fellowship Research Project funded by the Australian Research Council on the legal and regulatory support structures for small-scale sustainable economy initiatives in Australia and the UK. <h> Active and passive 
 on social impact can be a major challenge for not-for-profit and for-purpose organisations . However , following a few simple , fundamental rules can help a great deal . The rules are : tell a good story , be transparent around process and outcomes , and communicate precisely . <p> Tell a good story <p> A good story has a beginning , a middle and an end . But it also has character arcs and moments where we can see character development and growth.There are expectations set by the director and fulfilled or not fulfilled for the characters and audience . A good social impact narrative will include : <p> the key stakeholders ( characters ) <p> the inputs and outputs ( resources ) <p> a theory of change ( expectations ) <p> what actually happened ( change process ) <p> outcomes ( conclusions ) . <p> The best storytelling will also have a good balance between narrative ( qualitative ) and data descriptors ( quantitative ) . This balance is best determined by thinking about the quality of information that you have and how the audience needs are best met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons from it and apply it to our own situation . <p> Be transparent <p> The best social impact reports will impart authenticity and honesty , telling you about success but also about failure , risks , missed opportunities and unmet target outcomes . They will also not over-claim successes or over-attribute outcomes , where it is not justified to do so . <p> Finally , they will clearly articulate what goals they set , whether they met them or not and perhaps why they failed to meet them or how they will endeavour to meet them in future.To do so you may include the following in your report : <p> limitations <p> risks <p> future opportunities <p> shortcomings <p> challenges . <p> Communicate relevantly <p> This is about knowing , understanding and connecting with your audience.Your social impact report will likely be read by a range of stakeholders for a range of purposes .

 Pryor wants to engage young people in a conversation about mental illness and knows a pun can be the best way to spark a connection . <p> Social enterprise Totes Making a Diff is fairly self explanatory in name they 're totes that are making a difference . <p> Pryor says the idea stemmed from his two-to-three year battle with depression . <p> " I came out of that depression with a motivation to start a social enterprise to talk about issues that young people face , so issues like drug and alcohol addiction and mental illness , " Pryor said . <p> " What I saw amongst my friends and family was these sort of issues are main , common problems . <p> " To be able to have an outlet and a spark of conversation is really what Totes Making a Diff was for me . <p> " I had the idea really just walking out of the gym and just carrying a tote bag , and had a little chuckle and a laugh at the idea of making Totes Making a Diff with a punny business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an innovation consultant , spoke to a colleague in July who encouraged him to pursue the idea . After several months of collaborating with artists and designers the idea came to life in October . <p> Along with starting conversations , Totes Making a Diff donates 50 per cent of its profits to its charity partner , Artful Dodgers Studio in Collingwood , Melbourne . <p> With a pun-based name and a mission to use art and music to engage at-risk young people , including those dealing with drug and alcohol addiction and mental illness , Pryor says they were a perfect fit . <p> Established in 1996 by Jesuit Social Services , Artful Dodgers is one of the longest-running community cultural development programs in Victoria , the local nature of which appealed to Pryor . <p> " I reached out to them , " he said . <p> " I 've done a lot of work with larger charities like Fred Hollows and Oxfam and Red Cross and the sort of impact I gave to them was n't really substantial . <p> " So I really wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a substantial kind of impact with the money I was donating to them , but also be in line with the sorts of issues that I was trying to bring awareness to . <p> " It took me two to three months to find a charity that I could align myself with . <p> " And they were pretty shocked that I chose them and the ideas of what I wanted to do ... I actually had to have three meetings with three different people before they actually pinched themselves and believed that I was doing what I wanted to do . " <p> Pryor also wanted to work with a local organisation to take a hands-on approach , rather than just donating money . <p> Having worked for organisations including YGAP and founding social enterprise Compact Shelters , he says he values the opportunity to " be as engaging as possible " with partners . <p> " I find that the money that I 've donated previously , we 've just simply donated money and walked away and have n't really seen what sort of impact it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some sort of idea , for example we used to donate money to Fred Hollows , and we would do these parties and raise about $30,000 to $40,000 at a party , and we knew that $25 treats someone who 's blind , but we did n't see the actual after effects . We had an indication but that 's it . " <p> The money donated to Artful Dodgers will be used to fund the development of their own social enterprises , based around art and music . <p> " Basically things that they 're really good at , " Pryor said . <p> He will assist with the business acumen required to commercialise . <p> " I 'm going to be very hands on , and we 're going to be putting on a social-based hackathon to grow and build an audience for social entrepreneurs to think of ideas for them based around art and music , " he said . <p> " So working with Artful Dodgers , what we 're hoping to create is this sustainable model .... we 're helping them fund the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donation , so they can create an alternative income model away from government grants . <p> " It 's going to be a slow process , but once we 've developed these social enterprises , that 's going to create a sustainable model for them to stop worrying about having to apply for these grants and ... focus on what they 're doing in helping these young people . " <p> He says the challenge now is building an audience and a brand for Totes Making a Diff . <p> " We know the issues and we know what we 're growing awareness of , but how do we create a story that is original , to be able to attract that sort of audience online and on social media , " he said . <p> But he 's confident the unique and high-quality product will be a hit with his target audience . <p> " The first pun is a saucy illustration , it 's done by a local artist called Ellen Porteus , she signed with a very acclaimed artist agency called Jacky Winter Group and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> " So we 're now onto our second illustration , working on that with another local artist to start off . <p> " We 're wanting to really build the presence locally before we focus on moving things globally and focus on illustrators that are all abroad . <p> " We 're doing limited print runs , so we 're only doing 150 tote bags per illustration , which keeps it unique and it means that it 's very fresh all the time . <p> " We 're hoping to do , within 12 months , a print run , so 150 bags , a week . So then we can really get some huge engagement with a lot of artists worldwide . " <p> As of Wednesday

Abuse and neglect of Children in Care a Century-old Story in Australia <p> Thursday , 17th November 2016 at 10:37 am Katherine McFarlane , <p> The evidence revealed in the ABC 's Four Corners program of widespread abuse of children in care is an all too familiar story , writes Katherine McFarlane , senior lecturer in Justice Studies at Charles Sturt University , in this article which first appeared in The Conversation . <p> Nothing to See Here ? Abuse and neglect of Children in Care a Century-old Story in , 17th November 2016 at 10:37 am <p> The evidence revealed in the ABC 's Four Corners program of widespread abuse of children in care is an all too familiar story , writes Katherine McFarlane , senior lecturer in Justice Studies at Charles Sturt University , in this article which first appeared in The Conversation . <p> The Four Corners program this week presented evidence of widespread abuse and neglect suffered by children in the out-of-home care system . Sadly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system has been subject to criticism for over a century . <p> Children described bullying , harassment and sexual abuse inflicted by other children who share their homes . Children also described adult men preying on and sexually exploiting girls in " resi " or residential care . <p> There were allegations of 12-year-olds being left without adequate clothing , stable accommodation or sufficient food , abandoned by the agencies that were supposed to care for them . Private , for-profit agencies were accused of financial mismanagement and rorting of taxpayer funds . <p> Some of the most horrific allegations did n't make it to air , but were reserved for the digital broadcast available online immediately after the program . This included recent revelations of an alleged rape in New South Wales by UnitingCare staffers who had been entrusted with the care of 13-year-old " Girl X " , who died from a drug overdose just weeks before she was due to give evidence against her alleged attackers . <p> The digital broadcast also included the sexual predation by adults of children in Victorian state care , revealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie Geary . This is an issue that the South Australian Child Protection Systems Royal Commission has also exposed . <p> A familiar story <p> Depressingly , the Four Corners program did not reveal much that was new . My own research has identified equally devastating statistics of abuse and neglect of children in care . Almost a quarter of the children in my study had been abused while in care , in what were meant to be safe placements . <p> The abuse , which was confirmed by state authorities , took the form of physical beatings , violence and sexual assault . The younger the child , the more likely they were to have been hurt while in care . A third of children under 13 years of age had been abused and a quarter had attempted suicide . <p> It would be naive to assume that the child welfare system is always benevolent and focused on providing nurture , protection and support . It can not be guaranteed that the type of placement or the level of care provided is always based on a child 's needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally regarded as highly unsatisfactory . <p> The United Nations ( UN ) has called attention to the " widespread reports of inadequacies and abuse " in Australian care systems . The UN has complained of the inadequate screening , training , support and assessment of carers . It has also complained of the inappropriate placements of children , and the mental health issues that are " exacerbated by ( or caused in ) care " . <p> Children in care have worse life outcomes than their peers . Whether we 're measuring health , education , employment , stability , well-being , social inclusion , financial and emotional security or involvement in the criminal justice system , children in care perform badly , even when compared to children of roughly comparable backgrounds and problems . <p> A century-old problem <p> In the 1870s , a scathing assessment of the Australian care system by British child welfare reformers the Hill sisters led to a royal commission into charities . <p> On average , there has been a major inquiry into aspects of the child welfare system every three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care is exposed regularly . Every time , it 's met with the same excuses and promises . The children are presented as damaged , rather than the systems that are failing them . Agencies hide behind their professed best intentions and talk about " difficult " children . <p> Governments spruik their support for " salt of the earth carers " and the " saints " of child welfare . <p> These governments are afraid that if they probe too deeply into the failings of the system and agencies , they will be left holding the baby . The focus shifts from the care agencies ' failure to protect vulnerable children , to airing agencies ' calls for additional funding and even earlier intervention . <p> " Many of the things we wish would happen in the care system would follow naturally if the system and those who work within it were minded , and enabled , to act more like parents . " <p> The failure of government <p> Government interventions to enforce this have proved spectacularly unsuccessful . The mountain of memorandums of understanding , guidelines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , independent inquiries and reports established over the past 20 years in New South Wales alone have failed to improve things for children in care . Measures designed to protect children have not overcome the system 's inadequacies nor even begun to address the often questionable motivation and practices of the various players in the child welfare sector . <p> Government failure to hold the bureaucracy and its non-government sector partners accountable for poor decisions , inadequate oversight and accountability and the inefficient use of resources that erode the effective operations of the out of home care system is an indictment on us all . <p> These failures have allowed the problem of abuse and neglect in care to seem insurmountable , regardless of the devastation caused to the children concerned . There have been repeated professions of political goodwill and the commitment of countless millions of dollars across child welfare , juvenile justice , homelessness , education and health services . Despite this , we have failed to stop kids being abused by the very people we have trusted to care for them . <p> That the matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very time we have a Royal Commission watching the system shows the practitioners and agencies responsible for the neglect and abuse of children in their care have little to fear . <p> About the author : Katherine McFarlane is a senior lecturer in Justice Studies at Charles Sturt University .

" <p> The awards recognised the achievements of exceptional individuals for their professional contribution over the past year across 24 categories . <p> Stephen Cornelissen , group CEO of not-for-profit organisation Mercy Health was awarded the title of CEO of the Year . <p> Bryce was recognised for her efforts in meeting the challenges of the NDIS rollout " head on " . <p> In a bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , developed a new strategic plan and reinvigorated the workplace culture . <p> Bryce , who took the role of CEO in 2003 before leading the organisation through significant growth and a merger with The Crowle Foundation in 2009 , said the organisation had done a lot to prepare for the NDIS . <p> " We 'd always been behind the whole NDIS in terms of a better way for people with disability and their family ... to get funding , " she said . <p> " I 've been in the lounge rooms of the mums and dads who 've shared the stories of their family journey and shared the tears and have been emotionally affected myself by how hard it has been , so we 've always been behind the campaign from the word go , but we 've also been quietly just beavering away at our own set of circumstances . <p> " We were in a situation , we had been leading devolution work for 30 years but our last piece of devolution over the last bit of time following the merger meant that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet and we challenged ourselves at both a governance and operational level to dare to be different , dare to take some risks and be more agile in our approach . <p> " That meant that we took a balance sheet of $10 million and turned that into a $40 million outcome after six years of really sheer hard work , but you quadruple your balance sheet , improve your cash flow it means that as you 're going into a very disruptive market that you 've got working capital and you can have a way of thinking about your organisation differently . <p> " One of the things was that we consciously made a decision to move away from a welfare mentality and we actively had that conversation both at a board and operational level that we wanted to be the masters of our own destiny , and not to be beholden to a sort of cap in hand approach to government . <p> " So it was a real fit for us and we started that journey some years ago and then we proactively over the last couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thinking , new training and reaching out into the broader community into corporate to have more of a business relationship , learn from for-profits and think about things differently . " <p> Bryce said the secret to success was being clear in your vision . <p> " I do think if you can be clear in your vision and your purpose and maintaining that goal in the face of all sorts of adversity , and we 've faced a lot of adversity in changing the company , a lot of stakeholders who feared the change internally , externally , families of people with disability who did n't necessarily see how we were going to arrive at their vision , and you 've got to have a belief in that , " she said . <p> " And if you can get the support of your board to make the necessary changes , and certainly the board has backed me all the way with the changes that we made , we made some pretty bold decisions and so it was both the decision making , but also at a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your own purpose in life , resilience . <p> " You need to be really clear about why you are doing what you are doing , be very honest in that and very transparent and have the courage to back your convictions and get on with it and there were times when you know we did n't have the resources , that 's why I say it was sheer hard work , there was years and years , and if you can see what we 've just done in the last couple of weeks , so not only are we strong financially and we can reorganise ourselves despite significant disruption with the current administrative issues with the NDIS rollout , and we are experiencing significant disruptions ... but we 're strong and we 'll be ok and we 'll work through that and we 're very proactive . <p> " If you have that belief and you know you 're going to impact people 's lives , you get on with it . " <p> Bryce said the organisation was excited about the NDIS and wants to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their services and they will purchase services from the general marketplace and people are still yet to be able to exercise that choice and control and I ca n't wait to see how that plays out for people with disability and their families , " she said . <p> " We 're hopeful , we just want it to deliver on its promise and we do n't fear what that means in terms of if people go ' you know what we do n't want your services ' , that 's ok , because people can go out and test that and what we believe is that if we keep providing quality services then people will come back or chose us because they know they are going to get a consistent quality service from us , so we 're very excited about it . " <p> Bryce said the organisation had recently taken a suite of 15 apartments , the first of their kind in Sydney and New South Wales , built in medium to high density , and salt and peppered throughout three towers . <p> " No developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> " They have been built at the highest level of access , we 've just had the families and people with disabilities on the site visiting their apartments ... and they 've been crying because they 're so happy and they 've been so emotionally moved by the outcome that their family members are going to be living in these new beautiful socially inclusive apartments , it 's fantastic to watch , just wonderful . " <p> Bryce said the thing that " keeps her going " is knowing that she is making a difference in the lives of people with a disability . <p> " That 's not something that I take lightly , " she said . <p> " I come to work each day and people tell me about the stories about somebody moving out of a large residential , living in a community home , having a more intimate individualised support arrangement , how we can intervene in a way that we can enhance their everyday ... and the gorgeous things , the piece that is the takeaway is that people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strongest form of learning is modelling and I watch people who may not have done things for 20 , 30 , 40 years ... and suddenly within hours or days of moving out of these large congregate facilities and move into these more intimate home settings and suddenly people start doing things they have n't done for decades , but somewhere in their memory they remember . <p> " We had a man move out a few years ago and the staff told me , and I cried because they were crying , he went to the staff member and asked for a drink with what communication he had , the staff member took him to the fridge , poured him a glass of orange juice and he watched the man watch all this happen and he goes to the staff member half an hour later and he indicates he wants another drink and the staff member says to him you can go to the fridge and pour the drink yourself and he did . <p> " And what is powerful about that is that he could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor would the staff have thought to do that because he did n't have access to the fridge because it was in a central kitchen and in a home and I go to myself , can you imagine not being able to pour yourself a drink when you want it . <p> " When the staff talk to me and tell me their stories I get really emotional and they get really emotional because we change lives in ordinary ways that are profound and we know that they 're going to have lasting consequences . " <p> Bryce said her advice to other not-for-profit CEOs was just to believe . <p> " Believe in yourself , you do need to dig deep , build up a network around yourself both externally and internally and be prepared to reach out and ask for help when you know you need help .

 is a powerful way for communities to support one another in tackling social challenges , writes Richard Warner , coordinator of Nundah Community Enterprises Cooperative ( NCEC ) . <p> Peer-to-peer enterprise development is a powerful way for communities to support one another in tackling social challenges , writes Richard Warner , coordinator of Nundah Community Enterprises Cooperative ( NCEC ) . <p> Last year our humble workers co-operative in Nundah , Brisbane picked up a national award for best small social enterprise in Australia . Why ? Because we 've tackled the terrible market failure of people with disabilities and mental health issues being unable to find employment . We 've done this in a way that positions people not just as employees but as co-owners of an enterprise . We 've transformed ( albeit in a small way ) the local economy to create new jobs the results we 've achieved are not transitory but long term . <p> Since the award in 2015 we 've been approached by other communities facing what seem insurmountable barriers to employment , including groups from asylum seeker and refugee backgrounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a disability , who chose to support them because they could empathise with the situation . Work was then undertaken with a range of communities in practical , hands-on training in gardening or hospitality , combined with support to develop their own enterprise . Six new businesses have sprung from that work , which we call peer-to-peer enterprise development . <p> Why is the work innovative and why is it so needed ? <p> Peer-to-peer enterprise development <p> Peer-to-peer development is a powerful way to tackle entrenched disadvantage and it works for the following reasons : <p> it 's based in relationships and partnerships <p> it 's participant and not compliance focused and therefore adaptable to the situation at hand <p> it privileges doing " with " and " by " over doing " to " and " for " <p> it harnesses networks of community relationships , leveraging latent social capital <p> it 's " community to community " and therefore delivered by a group who has a lived experience of disadvantage and know something of the barriers being faced and what 's required to progress through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , this work pays for itself in terms of its effectiveness and the ripple effects it achieves as communities start to replicate the process independent of external support . <p> Case Study : The Mountain Mowing Men <p> Shree Monger and Bhakta Poudel both lived in a Nepali refugee camp for more than 20 years before gaining the opportunity to resettle in Queensland . After a number of years in Australia they , like many in the Bhutanese refugee community , were becoming frustrated at not being able to find work despite repeated attempts to do so . Barriers they faced included language , a lack of work experience in Australia and , of course , the significant structural issue of a lack of employment opportunities . <p> In Bhutan they had tilled their own fields for subsistence and profit a set of skills which led a refugee settlement agency , Multicultural Development Association ( MDA ) , to approach us to see if there was an opportunity to help them to develop a gardening business . We agreed to partner with MDA , supporting Shree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was provided by an experienced NCEC supervisor and our crew with disabilities . The Co-op also assisted with business planning and development and linkage with a pro-bono accountant and lawyer . MDA provided properties to service , which brought income to the project and also linked participants with skilled business mentors . <p> Together the two organisations supported the group through the process of practical training , business registration and planning and liaising with a range of systems including job agencies , the taxation office and Centrelink . <p> Importantly the project did n't just train people in the classroom , it walked the journey with them , helping them to develop the knowledge and connections required to succeed on their own . <p> The results speak for themselves : In just their first year of trade the Mountain Mowing Men , as Shree and Bhakta chose to name their partnership , have completed many thousands of dollars of work and have more than 30 regular customers . <p> In the wake of their success , another Bhutanese business is forming and we expect more to follow . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now feeling proud and hopeful of the future . <p> How to grow the model <p> What we need is more investment and documentation of this kind of work so it can be undertaken on a greater scale . <p> People often ask us if we would like to scale NCEC to achieve a greater breadth of social impact , and the answer in short is " yes " . <p> However , we are also aware of a size beyond which depth of impact and , in particular , community ownership can be lost . This leads us back to the challenge that significant scaling of community owned models will only occur by proliferation and federative efforts to support that ( ie " scaling across " as opposed to " scaling up " ) . <p> Insofar as government , philanthropy and the community sector support this , we will see many more disheartened communities being able truly say for themselves : " If we try then there is nothing that is impossible .

 of Adaptive Capability , works with clients across a number of industries to help them adopt practical and effective strategies to reduce their environmental impact while improving business effectiveness and financial sustainability . <p> In a Q and A , McEwen discusses how climate change is impacting businesses , how leaders can begin to change their practices and the sectors that are likely to boom as the fight against climate change gains momentum . <p> How is climate change impacting the business landscape ? <p> We take the view that climate change is happening , whether people like it or not . And it 's going to have to change in two main ways . So the first is the physical effects , so how businesses are exposed to things like rising sea levels and warming temperatures ... which affects some businesses more than others . <p> Then the second aspect is the way that consumers and governments respond to that , and we 're starting to see a real crescendo of activity in the way that consumers are responding . There are a growing number of green groups that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their act . And no business is immune from that . <p> A really interesting example was a couple of years ago when Greenpeace had a campaign against Lego for Lego 's support of Shell . Lego used to have a co-branding arrangement with Shell where they sold Lego sets with Shell petrol stations and tanker trucks in Shell stations . And Greenpeace said ' hang on a sec , Shell 's wanting to drill for oil in the Arctic ... what are you doing aligning your brand with their brand ' , and after x-million signatures on Greenpeace 's petition and a very interesting video featuring a Lego diorama of the Arctic that they then filled with oil , Lego announced that they would end their co-branding arrangement with Shell . <p> So you 've got that campaign from the green groups , you 've got the divestment campaign from the likes of the Asset Owners Disclosure Project and the Carbon Disclosure Project and various other groups that are advocating for funding managers of banks to get out of fossil fuel investment , and then you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... at the products that they buy , both residential consumers and some corporate procurement agents . <p> With the advent of the Paris Agreement , where everyone is hanging onto every word president-elect Trump says ... it is then putting a heightened emphasis on governments to act and that action will , over the next few years , start to translate into carbon pricing and other measures that will affect different sectors in different ways . <p> Along with all of these pressures , should businesses also see it as their responsibility to tackle climate change ? <p> Absolutely , and the message that we advocate is that actions for corporates on climate change , it 's not about changing lightbulbs , it 's actually about stepping back and looking at the business from a strategic level , and saying ' look if the climate 's changing and that 's going to have an underlying impact on the way world views corporate activity ' because it 's corporate activity that has led to the problem ' then corporate activity can help solve the problem ' . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a number of aspects of their strategy . And we boil it down to making sure they 're producing the right products in the right ways for the right markets at the right time . <p> What we mean by that is , the right products so products that people will actually need and want to buy in a climate changing world . One example of that , which I 've heard anecdotally , is that there 's a company in the UK that was making soups stocks , and it 's retooled its production line slightly , it 's using the same production line but is now producing a range of dessert toppings . So they 're effectively future-proofing their business against warmer summers and milder winters , and have that as a secondary revenue source . <p> Produced in the right way means the most energy efficient , the least polluting and so on . One example of that is construction products , so concrete and steel are two of the most greenhouse gas producing construction products that you can get . Each of them produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there 's now products available that are emerging as competitors to concrete and steel , one is the engineered timbered market -- cross-laminated timber . That could be a real game-changer for the construction industry in terms of demonstrating , ' hey , yeah we can use products other than concrete and steel for high-rise construction ' . <p> How can businesses start to look at changing what they do ? <p> In the book we provide a methodology and we 've got a diagnostic tool that we run on our clients . That looks at a variety of things , it looks at the governance structures they 've got , it looks at the way they 're measuring their environmental impact . One of the things we find is most larger organisations have a pretty good idea of what their direct emissions are , but they 've got very little idea of what the emissions are upstream in their supply chains . And they also do n't necessarily have a very clear idea of what the emissions and environmental impact is associated with the end use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens at the end of life for those products and services . So developing that measurement discipline will help organisations make more informed decisions about the types of products they produce and how they produce them . And also it will help identify opportunities for closing the loop and making more use of recycled materials . <p> We look at the variety of ways that they 're seeking to contain their environmental impact and reduce their environmental impact . We look at how they engage with the various stakeholder groups , employees and shareholders or governments or the community at large , making sure that those communications are honest and informed by appropriate scientific material as opposed to some of the greenwash that gets bandied about . <p> And we also look at how they approach risk management , so the assessment and mitigation of risks associated with climate change , both their exposure to the physical effects of changing weather and then how they deal with making their business as resilient as possible , which then flows into the strategic thing about making sure that their products are fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at adapting to climate change , should they be concerned , or are there a lot of opportunities ? <p> There is a lot of opportunity ... the book has a whole major section on what are the major opportunities in terms of the types of products and services that people will need . So there 's new product and service opportunities , there 's a lot of opportunity in infrastructure for example , so coastal infrastructure , water and wastewater projects , disaster management . <p> There 's a lot of opportunities for companies that are going green , they are actively looking to close to loop on their production processes and look at that cradle-to-cradle cycle for their products and services . And there 's also a lot of opportunity for innovators in sectors such as healthcare , food production , transportation , and energy and energy efficiency . <p> We see quite a lot of upside potential for quite a lot of sectors in the economy . <p> Businesses tackling climate change are emerging everywhere .

She talks about building relationships and trying to get policy change in this month 's Evolving Chair . <p> Christine Craik is the chair of Project Respect , an organisation that supports and works with women who are trafficked or who are working in the sex industry . She talks about building relationships and trying to get policy change in this month 's Evolving Chair . <p> Project Respect is a feminist , community-based , not-for-profit organisation that believes that every woman who is trafficked for sexual exploitation or is part of the sex industry has the right to feel safe and respected , regardless of her views or circumstances . <p> The organisation assists women one-on-one to create a safe community and advocate for women 's rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a social worker in family support , housing , community health and hospitals , where she has focused on domestic violence , sexual abuse and refugees , took on the role of chair earlier this year . <p> In addition she is currently completing her PhD and exploring routine domestic violence screening for women in emergency departments of Australian public hospitals . <p> She is also a social work lecturer at RMIT and the national vice president of the Australian Association of Social Workers ( AASW ) . <p> In this month 's Evolving Chair , Craik talks about the current energy at Project Respect , the role students can play and why organisations can not exist without collaboration . <p> What attracted you to Project Respect 's board ? <p> Well , I suppose I had been involved with Project Respect for a long time . So , I think even back in 2007 or 2008 , I 'd presented at a conference on something I was doing and met the founding director then , Kathleen Maltzahn , and she told me a little bit about the organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Project Respect and a member and supporter , so I was always a little bit in touch with what was going on . And then , there was a phone call from Kathleen asking if I would be interested in getting on their board a couple of years ago and I thought why not . I had quite a bit of board experience by then so I thought it would be a good thing to do . Then I took over as chair in March of this year . <p> You are also on the board of the Australian Association of Social Workers , how does your experience at Project Respect compare ? <p> Well it is a much smaller organisation Project Respect , but I think my work with the AASW and the governance training I have done through them with the AICD has actually been very beneficial at Project Respect . Because although it is a very small organisation we have had to sort of redevelop the business plan and put a lot of work into the strategic direction to take us through to the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , in one way a lot more work with Project Respect but on a smaller scale . <p> What are the key sector issues that are being discussed at board level at Project Respect ? <p> Looking at a business plan that will take us into the future , that will be sustainable . <p> One of the main things we 're trying to achieve at the moment is good relationships with our supporters , both financial and non-financial , in order that we can build up , or rebuild , that sense of community . Because there has been a fair bit of change at Project Respect so I think we really do need to put the time in and build on those relationships . So that 's one thing . <p> The other thing is of course continue to ensure that the staff can work with the clients that they need to work with and reposition us in terms of funding arrangements , so trying to get some sustainable funding to see Project Respect through to the next five years . <p> And also another major goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent policy change in Victoria , and hopefully Australia , that would help us fulfil our goals in terms of less women being trafficked , less girls being abused sexually . <p> What is the biggest challenge the Project Respect board has had to overcome ? <p> Just that lack of sustainable funding , I suppose , because we do n't get continuous funding from any government departments at the moment . So that would be the big challenge . <p> I suppose I could say staff morale , but I do n't think that 's the case , because everyone in there , I 'm quite shocked all the time at the energy and the commitment of the staff . They just keep on going . They are so excited about their work so that 's been pretty good and the same with the amount of research and scholarly enterprise I suppose , we 've just had so many social work students , both master 's and undergraduate placement doing various bits of research , various bits of policy work , so yeah , we found a way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 'm trying to scratch myself here for challenges because apart from the funding one , which looks better every month , the rest of it is sort of falling into line . There is a very good energy at Project Respect at the moment . <p> What has been the highlight of your work with this board ? <p> I suppose the highlight is the amount of work that is being done at Project Respect . So , there has been quite a lot of research , quite a lot of policy formation , some re-energising in terms of policies and procedures for the actual agency itself , physically even with the agency , we have been successful in getting some funding for sprucing up the office , if you like , so paint jobs , redesigning of offices , things like that , which all makes a difference when people can go to work and it looks great and feels good , so all that 's been going on . <p> And of course , the reputation of Project Respect in the brothels has been amazing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are happy for Project Respect workers to come in and talk to the women . And of course the mapping of the illegal brothels , that 's been one of the huge projects that students have been working on as well , with the workers there and they are mapping out in several local government areas the numbers of illegal brothels and how they 're existing and what their sort of mode of practice is and what is happening to the women in those brothels , in terms of no protection and things like that and so I guess the core work of Project Respect has been able to go ahead as well . <p> Absolutely . You ca n't exist without it , especially in an area like this . And it 's not just in like-minded organisations but organisations that have something to do with what you 're doing , so by that I mean the Australian Federal Police , the Red Cross , local city councils because they are pulling their hair out with the illegal brothels , wanting to know where they are as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies that we talk to and work with . <p> How important is a board 's relationship with the chief executive officer ? <p> Absolutely vital . I think I have always known really that the chair and the CEO really have to have a very good working relationship with a lot of respect and we do . And that filters down then , I think , for the rest of the board as well . So it is extremely important . <p> What advice would you offer to someone chairing a not-for-profit board ? <p> I would say make sure you get some training up , so that you know what you 're doing . If you are doing it for the first time , perhaps get yourself a mentor ... so you can have confidence that you are fulfilling your due diligence and make sure you are bringing others along with you . <p> The federal government

" <p> The three-year $1.7 million Giving Australia 2016 project is described as the largest ever research effort into philanthropic behaviour to understand how , why and how much Australians give to charity . <p> The report found that an estimated 14.9 million Australian adults ( 80.8 per cent ) gave a total of $12.5 billion dollars to charities and not-for-profit organisations over 12 months in 2015/16 , ( up from $7.7 billion in 2005 ) . <p> In 2016 the average donation was $764.08 and the media donation was $200 . <p> However the research pointed to a trend of fewer people giving more . While the percentage of people donating slightly decreased , the average donation increased in real terms by $210.16 . <p> Lead researcher and director of Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies at QUT Associate Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeing an improvement in giving overall in 2016 " it is not the gilded age of giving that we were noting when we were first doing this project in 2005 " . <p> " Then we were coming off the back of 10 years of really strong economic growth ... and when there is a strong economy there is strong giving , " Scaife said . <p> " It 's not the gilded age of giving . It 's not the wonderful growth in giving that we were noting back then but even though it is going ahead you would have to say with a note of caution it is starting to flatline . " <p> In that context she said Australia was also seeing the rise of the " charity bypass " . <p> " It is both a joy and a trial ... having technology that has enabled all of these wonderful ways that people can now give . And it 's easy . Technology has delivered it to our fingertips ... it 's delivered it to our mobile phones , to our iPads , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , a small cog in a huge wheel ... an outpouring of support in a tragedy in the community etc , " she said . <p> " Because this means that we do n't necessarily need the charity as the middleman and there is a real danger for the charities there . <p> " There 's real competition in a way in the sense of making charities think well where is our relevance and what is it that we are value adding and why are people wanting to go more directly when perhaps they should understand we know everything they need to know about this cause and we are experienced in that area so we can place their dollars far better . <p> " The academic term is ' disintermediation ' ... the cutting out of the middle person . The threat is both a concern and an opportunity . <p> " Of course smart charities are setting up their own programs and using crowdfunding as another vehicle to raise funds . They are going on as an organisation not an individual . All of that is possible through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fundraising were still the most often used by charities despite being less likely to attract a donation compared to a decade ago . <p> However while more than three-quarters of donors who were approached by telephone said they disliked being called , nearly one-quarter still made a donation when approached this way . <p> An on the topic of charity chuggers some 64.3 per cent of people said they disliked being approached by street fundraisers but 19.3 per cent still gave a donation . <p> In response to the decreasing effectiveness of traditional approaches , the report said many charities had invested in technologies making it easier to give through online and digital giving . <p> Scaife said one of the high points from the not-for-profit survey was regular giving . <p> " That comes back to technology and making that easier , " she said . <p> " You know with face-to-face some people love to hate it . It is appealing to some part of the community who are happy to sign up to that regular gift via face-to-face . People are now signing up for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit is coming through very strongly . " <p> The report found that some 60.5 per cent of survey respondents indicated that they generally give on the spur of the moment . Those who plan their donations give six times more dollars . <p> Scaife said a particular highlight of the research for her was the growth of collective giving via giving circles and community foundations which she described as giving " tribes " . <p> " There is something tribal when you get together as a group and you bring different skills and we are starting to see the emergence of giving tribes . In any tribe there is a synergy to it ... they do what they do better as a tribe , " she said . <p> " I 'm a bit excited about that . What we are hearing is that people are loving giving socially and loving learning as well and working with like-minded people . It is a genuine spirit of making a difference . " <p> She said one of the surprises from the research was the social phenomenon that fewer people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 around 58 per cent of Australians had a will and of those 7.5 per cent had included a charitable bequest . This time it is 51 per cent and again 7.5 per cent have included a charitable bequest . <p> " So despite very good efforts from campaigns like include a charity and charities becoming more sophisticated in getting the message out about leaving a gift in your will , we still have that social phenomenon that fewer people are actually making a will . " <p> Scaife said overall the research was really the story of context and the story of paradox . <p> " With this kind of depth of data it 's not one simple clear message . It is the case that everyone will look at it from the perspective of their own community or organisation or giving and what we hope across the next year is to bring out maybe 50 to 100 messages that come from the data and get them out there so that people can chew them over . " <p> The co-research leads for the Giving Australia 2016 research project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Impact at Swinburne University and Professor Myles McGregor Lowndes OAM , the former Director of The Australian Centre of Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies and now at QUT Business School . <p> In launching the report the Assistant Minister for Social Services Senator Zed Seselja said Giving Australia 2016 provided an understanding of how and why Australians give and volunteer , how much they donate and how these factors affect the not-for-profit and philanthropy sectors . <p> " The level of detail provided in these reports will help the sector shape and implement strategies to build on successes enjoyed to date . The research has also identified barriers to giving and volunteering along with the factors which negatively affect people 's desire to donate money and help others being approached too aggressively and a perception of waste .

At a ... <p> The NSW Federation of Housing Associations has welcomed a commitment by state and federal treasurers to move ahead with creating a new financial bond aggregator to enable large-scale institutional investment in affordable housing . <p> At a meeting in Canberra on Friday the Council on Federal Financial Relations pledged to set up an expert taskforce to design a new structure that would open up cheaper loan rates for community housing investment in new homes . <p> The new taskforce is one of four recommendations in the federal government 's Affordable Housing Work Group report tabled at the meeting . <p> Federation CEO Wendy Hayhurst said unlocking access to institutional financing for community housing providers was critical in establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market between the private development sector and public housing . <p> " Countries around the world have embraced not-for-profit housing as an essential component of a modern , well functioning , housing market , but so far the relatively small size of the sector here in Australia has meant that it ca n't borrow at the rate or scale needed to grow and provide a real solution to housing unaffordability . <p> " Crucially , the working group also recognised that , to make the new framework effective , government action will also be needed to support a long-term pipeline of affordable housing projects .

 who was a recipient of RMIT 's 2015 Sustainability Seedlings Funding for her project highlighting RMIT 's impact as a Fairtrade University , writes about her fairtrade journey of India . <p> Around a cosy table , over cups of freshly brewed Makaibari tea we share moments , laugh about our cultural differences , and slowly the story of the lives of these nine people and the small community are revealed . They are my homestay family for this stop on my fairtrade journey of India.Their source of life is the sea of deep green tea plants that surround this village and region . <p> The famous Darjeeling tea is to be sent to kettles , tea cups and tables around the world . On this estate it is proudly produced with fairtrade , organic and bio-dynamic principles . I wonder , as I have in the fairtrade garment factories and other organisations I visited , what does fairtrade mean for this community , what are the problems they face , and how is fairtrade benefiting workers ? <p> Fairtrade is a movement , a set of values , a certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle within certified and many non-certified organisations and supply chains . It seeks to challenge the deep disadvantages of trade , and bring people back to the centre of our trading values . It is found in a range of industries and trading systems , and Not for Profit , profit-making , and social enterprise organisations . Each have their own challenges , each prioritise the fairtrade principles that best suit their own values or capabilities , and each see different benefits for their producers and workers . <p> Tea sorters <p> Within the tea estate the impact of fairtrade was most evident with the fairtrade premium , a community development fund paid through fairtrade product purchases . Walking the 100 metres or so that forms this village , one of several on the 1,500 acre estate , it is impossible not to come across something funded by the premium . <p> There is a community centre which organises local homestays to supplement household incomes , a community library with shelves of books , computers and a librarian , and a healthcare centre arranging a variety of health programs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint body , comprised predominantly of women , surprising among the patriarchal norms found in India . <p> In the other organisations and industries that I visited , different impacts were strongly visible . They included skills development , livelihood opportunities and international market access for small artisan and producer groups . These groups were rural and remote silk producers , trafficked women attempting to leave a life of prostitution , people affected by leprosy living on the edges of the community , and people economically marginalised because of their disabilities . <p> In the garment industry , fairtrade meant receiving at least minimum wages , having the ability to join worker unions , working in a healthy and safe environment , learning a craft , and permanent contracts with benefits . <p> The first female supervisor on the plantation blazing the way for all women of Makaibari <p> Fairtrade is changing the worlds of each of these communities and it is improving the lives of the most disadvantaged people in the supply chain . But it is struggling against systemic contextual challenges . My tea plantation host family laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realise that even with fairtrade this is not a relevant goal for this community . While they receive a range of benefits , the Plantation Labour Act ( PLA ) allows them to be paid lower than the Indian minimum wage . <p> In a cotton community , I visit a high-quality school built using fairtrade premium funds and I am told that large portions of salaries in India are spent on private schooling as there are vast quality differences between public and private schools . Fairtrade alone can not overcome these systemic challenges . It is also fighting for a place within a trading system increasingly skewed towards low prices and high profits . Unfortunately this leads to cost-cutting in the only area left where prices can be flexible : human labour . An eye-opening moment for me was when it was pointed out that we should n't ask why fairtrade products cost more , we should ask why other products do not cost enough . They are cheap because corners are cut . The systemic issues that are creating these disadvantages require more than one tool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil sectors , consumers and producers , and adjustment towards fairer systems . <p> Fairtrade seeks for a readjustment of the benefits of trade to ensure the whole supply chain receives proportionate benefits . It argues that nothing is sacrificed along the way , including quality , the environment , and the people . It gives voices to the most disadvantaged people in the supply chain and it re-connects consumers to the people producing their products . Fairtrade to me is an essential development tool with an inspiring vision of a world where trading fairly is the norm . <p> About the author : Melanie Lazelle is in the final stages of her Master of International Development . was a recipient of RMIT 's 2015 Sustainability Seedlings Funding for her project highlighting RMIT 's impact as a Fair Trade University .

However , this situation is changing and the significance of this is profound . <p> Drawing on 125 in-depth interviews conducted in Sydney and regional New South Wales ( discussed in detail in my book , The Australian Dream : Housing Experiences of Older Australians ) , it is evident that these substantial differences in housing costs combined with differing levels of tenure security have a fundamental impact on the capacity of Australians dependent solely or primarily on the age pension to lead a decent life . <p> The interviews I conducted with the older homeowners , particularly with couple households , indicated that provided they did not have extraordinary expenses ( high medical bills , excessive smoking and or drinking , having to look after a child etc. ) , they managed reasonably well on the age pension . They could run a car , engage in modest leisure activities , travel and even save . <p> Margaret , who lived by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do participate . I do n't go to the opera because that 's too expensive ... I do n't go to live shows because they 're too expensive , but that 's okay . I do other things . I 'm a very busy person . " <p> Although the housing costs of older social housing tenants are high relative to homeowners , the fact that their rent is pegged at 25 per cent of their income means they have a fair amount of disposable income after paying for their accommodation . <p> Betty , a social housing tenant , summed up their situation : " In public housing you see , even if they 've only got the old age pension , nothing else , because their rent is only a quarter of their income , they manage , most of them quite well . People who do n't manage are the ones who drink , smoke a lot ... or who have an illness that requires heavy expenditure on medication . " <p> In addition , historically , older social housing tenants have had guaranteed security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this security : " When you know your accommodation is right , this is especially when you 're older , you can pursue other interests . You 're more relaxed and I do feel , I really feel you 're in for a longer life you know ... I 'm quite content and I think it 's just wonderful that the government does supply these houses . " <p> Private renters live with insecurity <p> Many older private renters live in a state of perpetual insecurity as they can be told to leave at any time . <p> The third group , older private renters dependent on the age pension for their income , are in a completely different position . A large proportion of them are having to use a large proportion of their income to pay for their rent . <p> Also , once their lease ends they can be asked to leave at any time no grounds have to be given . The resulting perpetual insecurity combined with the cost of their housing is the basis for enormous anxiety and distress . <p> Maggie , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age pension is unrealistic . I mean I thank God for it because I 'd never make ends meet otherwise . I really thank God for it , but it 's unrealistic . You can not live on that . I mean what would you live on ? It 's a joke . I was lucky that I had the income from working on the side ... I could n't have lived like that without working a bit . " <p> Helen painted a bleak picture . Even though she was drawing the couple pension she was clearly suffering enormous psychological distress : " Sometimes I think I 'm too old for this . Maybe I 'll be dead in a year 's time and we would n't have to worry about it . All the stress ... I said to my doctor , ' Why keep us alive when there 's nothing there for us ? ' I said , ' There 's no help for us , ' and she agreed with me ... I told her we could n't get into a retirement village or even buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even buy that . So we have a little bit of money but we ca n't do anything with it . It 's not enough to help us . " <p> When I asked Janet , who had been a private renter for a long time , how she responded when she heard that she had been accepted for social housing , she said : " I was absolutely , well , I sat down and cried . I literally sat down and cried because I felt like , well , at least I had the protection of the Department of Housing whereas before of course I did n't have any of that . I had no protection whatsoever ... My children were having children so they could n't take care of me . They 're just working-class people and so they could n't care for me ... So consequently I could n't see any future at all until I got the word from Housing that I have got somewhere . " <p> Numbers of vulnerable older people are rising <p> The power of affordable and secure housing to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age pension is clear . <p> However , there is no doubt that an increasing proportion of older Australians on the age pension will be dependent on the private rental sector in coming decades . This is because of the housing affordability crisis and increasing divorce in later life , combined with the virtual stagnation of the social housing sector . <p> In 2013/14 , 4.8 per cent of couples aged 65-plus and 9.5 per cent of people living by themselves were private renters . Among 55 to 64 year olds , these proportions were almost double : 8.4 per cent of couples and 20.7 per cent of lone-person households in this age cohort were private renters . Almost all of these households will still be private renters when they become dependent on the age pension , so the prospects for this group are grim . <p> About the Morris is a research professor in the Institute of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Technology Sydney .

 patron of mental health charity SANE Australia , Anne Deveson , has died at the age of 86 . <p> was also well known as a writer , broadcaster and filmmaker . <p> SANE Australia CEO Jack Heath said Deveson was a pioneer in mental health who opened up the national public conversation about mental illness in Australia . <p> " At a time when there was a widely-held view that a mother could cause their child 's schizophrenia , Anne publicly spoke about her son Jonathan 's condition and the challenges this presented for her and her family , " Heath said . <p> " Anne was highly respected and well-connected as a journalist , broadcaster and filmmaker , as well as the ' everywoman ' star of the Omo laundry detergent commercials . In this way , she connected with people across the country . <p> " She was fearless in her advocacy , never needing an invitation to speak , and she always put others before herself . " <p> In 1986 , Deveson teamed up with another mental health pioneer Dr Margaret Leggatt to launch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toured the country holding conversations that led to the establishment of many local organisations supporting individuals and their families affected by schizophrenia . <p> " A pivotal moment on this journey was on a wet and windy night in Sydney at the Teachers Federation Hall . Anne had assembled a large gathering of people when a young man stood up and courageously announced , ' My name is Simon Champ and I have schizophrenia , ' " Heath said . <p> " Working with Simon , Anne drew on her extensive network to raise funds and launch the first national media campaign on mental illness . " <p> Heath said she was a passionate advocate for the need to reduce stigma around complex mental illnesses , like schizophrenia , and for people , like Champ , to be at the forefront sharing their story . <p> " She respected both the individuals living with the condition and the families caring for them , " he said . <p> " There was a golden thread of humanity that ran through everything Anne did . When Anne developed Alzheimer 's she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chronicled in an effort to help others . " <p> He said she was a passionate trailblazer , fearless and always concerned for others dealing with the most tragic of circumstances . <p> " We will miss her but we will honour her by continuing the work to ensure that everyone affected by mental illness lives a long and fulfilling life . <p> " On a personal note , I first met Anne in a bookshop in Broome in the late 1990s when we were both dealing with the challenges of chronic fatigue . It was only a few years after my young cousin had died from suicide and he , like Anne 's son Jonathan , had been living with schizophrenia so there was a strong bond from the very beginning . At the time , I was also working to establish the Inspire Foundation in an effort to reduce Australia 's then escalating rates of youth suicide . Anne and I kept in contact . <p> " When I took on the CEO role at SANE Australia in 2012 , it meant the world to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often catch up for a cup of tea at her house in Clovelly , until I noticed she was starting to forget things . <p> " The last time I saw her was two weeks ' ago , on the eve of SANE 's 30th anniversary celebration .

It was n't easy to maintain a conversation with Anne but at one point she leant over to me and said ' You know what ? I think I 've been able to do some good things in my life . Yes , I have .

SAA provides a framework to provide this evidence , regardless of size . <p> While several tools for the measurement of social impact have emerged , many of these tools have proved to be expensive , consultant driven and not sufficiently focused on business improvement . Some of these tools are also concerned primarily with " numbers " rather than the more qualitative aspects of service delivery , including importantly social capital and relationship building . The result has been that these tools have tended to be adopted by organisations with sufficient resources to capitalise on their impact for marketing purposes . <p> SAA alternatively implants a strategic measurement and reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and values of the host organisation . SAA can prove what value a social organisation adds to society by building accounting , monitoring and reporting systems that show social , environmental , economic and cultural impacts . In highlighting improved performance where it has taken place , it introduces processes to further improve that performance . Through stakeholder engagement a key aspect of SAA -- increased accountability produces more rapid understanding of impact on beneficiaries , as well as in the surrounding community , resulting in sharpened service response . <p> SAA is not an external evaluation and , unlike other tools , it requires no ongoing external consulting to complete . Rather it is for social organisations themselves to identify their values and objectives and to take responsibility for reporting on them . In this way , SAA enables an accurate description of what is being achieved and can demonstrate this to others in a much more holistic way . <p> As a social impact measurement technique , SAA is functioning in many countries , supported by the international Social Audit Network based in the UK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which much is now available in terms of skills , experience , manuals , tools and supports , as well as contact with SAA practitioners around the world . <p> The Mercury Cooperative is developing a pathway for readily accessible SAA in Australia and is working on a program of three components to achieve this : <p> Entry : for organisations indicating an initial interest in social accounting , information and guidance can be provided from a range of members and associates . <p> Facilitation : for those organisations proceeding to training , access will be enabled to online resources and templates , along with setting up internal processes to produce social accounts and to submit them for assessment . <p> Assessment : reviewing an organisation 's social accounting , auditing and reporting processes and providing feedback for business improvement and enhanced social impact . <p> Benefits to the community <p> There are many good reasons why SAA will add considerable value to the growth and performance of the social economy in Australia . <p> SAA can enable the tens of thousands of mostly smaller community organisations , social enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to start doing so . <p> sharper understanding of core values , cultural differences and social objectives <p> more open internal and external appraisals of social performance . <p> SAA also adds value to public policy development as it operates to key principles which deliver what is being demanded from funded services , in a much broader sense than simply " return on investment " . <p> It does this through : <p> giving social organisations a clearer understanding of what they are achieving <p> highlighting how much it is costing them to achieve that , while <p> enabling different stakeholders to readily perceive that " success " , while taking into account cultural differences . <p> SAA delivers this in a simpler , more practical and useful way than other approaches . It also builds confidence and community resilience through its do-it-yourself business improvement process . <p> Well-functioning SAA can also stimulate increased social investment in communities through better showcasing " success " .

 Hermit Kingdom of Bhutan : GNH , Mindfulness and TechnologyWednesday , 14th December 2016 at 9:00 am <p> On a recent trip to Bhutan , Mike Davis , founder of Purposeful , discovered the positive social impact of incorporating " gross national happiness " principles into policy and business . <p> Two weeks ago I set off on a 12-day group tour of Bhutan with 20 other young Australian changemakers . Amongst our group were environmental and conservation experts , public servants , creative directors , startup entrepreneurs and health workers . <p> We were invited and hosted by the GNH Centre of Bhutan and guided through the work of the GNH Centre and Bhutan 's rich recent history by talismanic GNH Centre director Dr Saamdu Chetri . <p> Our goal was simple to better understand ourselves , to become more effective storytellers and to appreciate Bhutan 's unique culture , values and approach to wellbeing . This would play out across a country , described as a hermit kingdom , sandwiched between two emerging global superpowers in China and India . <p> From the moment you fly into Bhutan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've visited before . The main terminal at Paro airport , looks like any other ancient Dzong ( Buddhist temple ) that you may visit here . You will also notice the vast Himalayan ranges , bathed in sunshine and crisp air . Below I have outlined some of the key learnings from my time in Bhutan : <p> Wellbeing is greater than wealth <p> Bhutan is well known for its GNH , or gross national happiness , approach to policy , regulation , development and lifestyle . This philosophy was announced by the fourth king of Bhutan in the 1970s and later became official public policy from 2008 to today . <p> GNH is essentially a new approach to understanding wellbeing that prioritises cultural preservation , conservation of the environment , community vitality , wisdom and spirituality . It is used as both a way to measure the happiness of the population and also as a policy and projects planning tool to ensure future sustainable development that promotes wellbeing . <p> Using this method , Bhutan is able to ensure that any developments impacting upon the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the reason that Bhutan does n't allow any smoking in public , public product advertising or large-scale mining or extraction projects . <p> Bhutan is also the only " carbon-negative " country in the world and is legislatively bound to maintain forestry grounds at greater than 60 per cent of the country . Currently forestry is around 70 per cent . <p> Mindful business equals good business <p> During our time here , we learned about businesses around the world that are having great success integrating the GNH principles . More can be learned via the Global Wellbeing and GNH Lab , created in partnership with Otto Scharmer 's Presencing Institute . Group of Thailand ( conglomerate ) and Eileen Fisher ( a fashion retailer ) of the USA have recently implemented the GNH principles . <p> Group has recently agreed to host Thailand 's first official GNH Centre . The Group of companies prides itself on " doing business with compassion " . At Group , this has involved providing mindfulness and GNH training to its whole management team . Further work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles into its way of working . <p> At Eileen Fisher this has involved sourcing ethical materials and implementing regular meditations and mindfulness rituals into work meetings . The company is also in the early stages of applying GNH metrics to regularly assess how the company is progressing on a GNH basis . Eileen is also a strong advocate for the role that companies can have in pivoting toward a greater global consciousness in how business is conducted . <p> It is great to see businesses that prioritise compassion and wellbeing under the GNH model grow and flourish globally . This looks to be a phenomenon spreading in Australia with the growth of B Corps , social enterprises , conscious businesses and recognition that happy and well people make great businesses . <p> Technology is a fine balance <p> Bhutan first received TV in 1999 and internet a few years later . The king allowed these mediums into the country as a response to growing pressure and demand from the public . There was some consternation at the time with many believing that TV and internet would damage the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality . <p> There is now a worrying trend in Bhutan of increasing mental health issues and divorce rates . Many believe that TV , the internet and social media are partly to blame for this . On the other hand , most Bhutanese now possess smartphones , allowing them to form strong social networks and to participate in global discussions . <p> A highlight of the trip was participating in a meditation and Q and A with the most senior monk in a remote province of Bhutan . As he stood up from his half lotus position , he calmly opened his sheik leather case and checked his iPhone 6 , presumably for messages from numerous other phone-wielding monks at the Dzong . <p> Overall , I 'd say that technology has helped the Bhutanese to live more fulfilled , connected and empowered lives . Where we can learn , is in how most Bhutanese recognise that TV and internet should not be at the centre of our lives . They are rather a tool , that we can use from time to time to seek information and connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique , once in a lifetime experience .

 paradoxical , but tech is getting in touch with it 's natural side , with digital advancements increasingly used to solve some of the most complex environmental problems . <p> A key theme of the recent Purpose conference , which explored the " revolution " , was Planetary Tech , looking at how environmental and human goals are being served via a combination of technology and nature . <p> Speaker and Wildlabs.net community manager Stephanie O'Donnell said there were " huge opportunities " in technology for social good and " transforming the way we understand and interact with the natural world " . <p> Wildlabs.net brings conservationists who use technology in their work together with technologists who are interested in using their skills for wildlife conservation . <p> " It 's very much about collaboration and connection to improve how we use tech in my sector , " O'Donnell told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " Wildlabs.net was conceived and empowered by the United for Wildlife Collaboration , which is seven international conservation organisations , which include WWF and TNC . <p> " Those conservation organisations were brought together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge and Prince Harry , who convened these organisations to come together and work on issues like the illegal wildlife trade and engaging 15 to 30 year olds in wildlife conservation . <p> " And in that collaboration the issue they identified was the fact that with technology , there 's so many opportunities for us to use it better , but what we need is to be a little bit better at sharing what each other is doing . <p> " Information gets siloed within different organisations , different academic institutions , even different field offices . It 's really hard to understand what everyone else is doing and to share lessons learnt and collaborate . We 're time bound and funding bound . So there 's this big gap in terms of information and creating a space for collaboration . " <p> With the help of tech giants Google.org and ARM , the collaboration founded Wildlabs.net . <p> " It 's the place for them to share what they 're working on , crowdsource answers to questions about deploying technology in their work , whether it 's using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves or using machine learning to analyse millions of camera-trap images , " O'Donnell said . <p> " These are some of the things our community members are working on . It 's a place where they can meet like-minded folk and understand what 's out there , what potential technology has to be deployed in their work . And it 's also a place for technologists , like engineers , designers or makers , to use their skills and discover how they can help conservationists in their work and use their skills for good . " <p> She said in its first year alone it has filled a gap conservationists and environmental organisations were experiencing . <p> " In the first year we 've grown very organically because we wanted to feed our community with conservationists and be challenge-led rather than just have technologies and saying ' where can we apply these ' , making sure that what 's coming through first is saying ' these are the issues on the ground , how can we fix them ' , " she said . <p> " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members worldwide and we 've had visitors from 110 different countries and a lot of field-based members who are just crying out for this sort of resource and for a community that can help them deploy technology . " <p> However , she said projects which combined technology with social and environmental problem solving should still be cautious of unintended consequences . <p> " We 're getting all this data , we 're getting all this information , it could be fantastic , it could be transformative , but there are also other things to consider , " she said . <p> " Who is actually getting access to the data , are we making it easier for poachers for example to access animals , are there privacy concerns ? <p> " A lot of people get really excited by technology , and it is wonderful and it has such potential in my sector to have such a huge impact for good . <p> " But we do need to think about how we 're applying it and have the social discussions , have the ethical discussions , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices into the discussions about what we 're doing and how we 're deploying technology so it 's deployed for the benefit of all .

 the Realities of Domestic and Family Violence in the WorkplaceMonday , 19th December 2016 at 9:46 am <p> Workplaces can make a difference on many levels if they face up to their responsibilities in the quest to reduce family and domestic violence , writes Diversity Council Australia CEO Lisa Annese . <p> Many members of the not-for-profit sector will be acutely aware of the problem of domestic and family violence in Australia ; it has major societal impacts which the welfare sector is frequently called upon to address . However , this problem at home is also undeniably a problem for the workplace . <p> Of the 1.4 million Australian women who are living in an abusive relationship , or have been so in the past , about 800,000 are in the paid workforce and although precise data is not available , the vast majority of perpetrators are probably also employed in some capacity . <p> Corporate Australia must be educated and encouraged to face up to the realities of domestic and family violence . Not only is there a moral imperative for them to take action to overcome this crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2021 domestic and family violence will cost Australian businesses $609 million annually . <p> Absenteeism is possibly the most obvious evidence of how domestic violence impacts the workplace , but most victims of this abuse experience feelings of anxiety and distraction which can affect productivity and performance . Economic security is the single most important factor in whether a victim of domestic violence is able to withdraw from a dangerous situation . So it is vital that allowances are made by employers . To suspend or terminate someone due to unreliability related to domestic violence , is to victimise these employees further . Allowing flexible work arrangements is ideal in these circumstances . <p> It is pleasing to note that over the last five years many companies have introduced the option of domestic violence leave , but simply announcing that such paid leave is available is not enough . Detailed policies and implementation programs are needed if this is to really make a difference . <p> The recent Male Champions of Change report , Playing our Part : Lessons Learned from Implementing Workplace Responses to Domestic and Family Violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that employees should feel supported in accessing it and not required to provide onerous proof . Sensitivity in handling these matters is essential and confidentiality must be assured . <p> But what about the source of the problem ? Environments where gender inequality and the perpetuation of gender stereotypes go unchecked contribute to the problem of violence against women . Workplaces must therefore lead by example and embody policies that encourage respect for all and do not tolerate prejudice based on gender or indeed race , religion , sexual orientation , age or disability . <p> It is na ? ve to think that someone 's violent behaviour and attitudes only emerge at home . Workplace Codes of Conduct should outline how bullying , harassment and physical violence will not be tolerated . Furthermore , using work time and resources to engage in violent , threatening or abusive behaviour must not go unchecked . Domestic violence is a crime and there may be times when the police must be called upon , but at the same time establishing referral pathways for perpetrators is also important . <p> Telstra 's latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Change , includes guidance for managers about perpetrators . Following advice from subject matter experts who work in the Family and Domestic Violence sector , Telstra managers are encouraged to support perpetrators in being held accountable for their actions ( eg to attend court or behaviour change programs ) . <p> Workplaces can and will make a difference on many levels if they face up to their responsibilities in the quest to reduce the prevalence and impact of family and domestic violence . <p> About the author : Lisa Annese has been chief executive officer for Diversity Council Australia since 2 June 2014 .

 young people in residential care do not feel safe and believe " drastic changes " need to be made to improve their safety , according to a new report . <p> The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse released the findings of a study on Monday exploring the experiences of children and young people in residential care . <p> The report , the first of its kind in Australia to explore the issue from the perspective of young people , found most young people in residential care felt they were at risk of physical violence , sexual threats from their peers and from outsiders , and of ongoing bullying and harassment . <p> The study also found that children 's experiences of harm were often under-reported , and that children and young people could provide unique observations on the experience of abuse in residential care as well as how best to support children and young people in care . <p> Lead researcher Dr Tim Moore from the Institute of Child Protection Studies ( ICPS ) said the study highlighted that adult 's views about children 's safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young people felt they needed to be safe . <p> " It was really important for us to spend that time with children and young people and really glean from them what they needed in regards to safety within residential care and for us to be able to respond to that , " Moore told Pro Bono Australia News . <p> " We knew that residential care was problematic , but I suppose what has been understated in the past is that feeling of being unsafe . <p> " So even if kids are n't the victims of bullying or violence or what have you , if they are exposed to that and see their peers being abused or assaulted or reflecting some of that abuse via self harm or suicide or something then it takes a significant toll on kids ' mental health . " <p> Researchers from the ICPS at Australian Catholic University , with partners from Griffith University and Queensland University of Technology , spoke to 27 young people aged 10 to 21 years living in residential care in Australia . <p> They asked them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed residential care units were preventing and responding to abuse-related issues . <p> Moore said the key takeaway was that most children and young people said they did not feel safe , with a lack of stability , concerns about their peers and limited connections to trustworthy adults all highlighted as concerns . <p> " They advocated for safe residential units : those that were home-like , that functioned as they believed a normal home and family functioned , and where life was better than it was when they lived with their biological families or in foster care , " Moore said . <p> " They also identified a range of issues that compromised their safety within residential care . <p> " Many young people discussed bullying , physical and sexual harassment and violence , and felt ambivalent about staff members ' capacity to effectively prevent or deal with these types of issues , often feeling that they had to be responsible for preventing these issues themselves . " <p> In Australia , residential care is considered to be a placement of last resort for children and young people requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where other types of OOHC are unsuccessful or unavailable . <p> In 2015 there were 2,394 children in residential care in Australia , almost 5 per cent of the 43,400 children living in OOHC . <p> Moore said the participants " had a whole long list of ideas " about what could be done to improve their experience in residential care , including better matching of peers , involving young people in decision-making about placements , and limiting the number of moves from one unit to another . <p> " I think a few things came through quite strongly , " he said . <p> " Children and young people wanted to have a say about their placements , they wanted for residential care to be a port of last call but they were also aware that when ... every other possibility of care had to be exhausted first , that often kids were left in limbo for long periods of time , so they felt that if kids could n't be placed in other out of home care placements that really non-government organisations and child protection systems needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long period of time . <p> " They also felt that staff should develop a better appreciation of the risks of sexual abuse and other harms , and inform and educate young people about threats , how they are being protected and how they can protect themselves . <p> " I think also the study pointed to that fact that adults are n't always in the best position to know what kids need and that when we are designing child-safe residential care , we really have to start with understanding what children and young people feel they need and to respond to that . " <p> Moore said they would be keen to do further research into the issues . <p> " International studies have shown that staff attitudes and behaviours really influence the extent to which kids are safe living in residential care . So we would be really keen to explore that further , " he said . <p> " What training and support and supervision do workers in residential care need to be able to respond to kids safety concerns , how can they better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set up relationships with kids so that if a young person is worried they are going to be abused or exploited that they have someone to turn to for advice and for protection . " <p> Royal commission CEO Philip Reed said the research would directly contribute to the Royal Commission 's final report and may inform recommendations in relation to residential care or OOHC . <p> Moore said he hoped the report would show the commission there was a crucial part to play in facilitating children and young people 's participation . <p> " I think that to an extent I agree with other commentators saying that most residential care is n't safe and kids and we really need to change the way that we offer residential care , " he said . <p> " But that for a small group of kids it is the safest place and the place where they feel most safe and with some investment in staff and resourcing , residential care can have good outcomes for children and young people .

 philanthropists have favoured universities in 2016 , donating record-breaking amounts towards all aspects of tertiary education and university life . <p> Figures obtained by Pro Bono Australia News show that the biggest philanthropic gifts in 2016 delivered major Australian universities a share in more than $269 million more than double the estimated $117 million donated to universities in 2015 . <p> The top annual donation came from philanthropists Graham and Louise Tuckwell to The Australian National University after donating $200 million in the country 's largest ever personal philanthropic contribution to a university . <p> Graeme and Louise Tuckwell . Photo by Stuart Hay , ANU . <p> The billionaire couple , who donated $50 million to the ANU to establish the Tuckwell Scholarship Program in 2013 , announced in July they were funding the construction of two new halls of residence at a cost of around $100 million each , to ensure the long-term future of the program . <p> Graham Tuckwell , a former ANU student , said university education had transformed his life and he wanted to give more students the same opportunity . <p> " Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to help and encourage others to gain from a total university experience and to use it to benefit Australia , " Tuckwell said . <p> The second largest philanthropic gift to a university was from Sydney property tycoons Susan and Isaac Wakil whose foundation donated $35 million to the University of Sydney . <p> The funds are to be used for the construction of the Susan Wakil Health Building which will co-locate the faculties of nursing and health sciences with medicine , pharmacy and dentistry to provide a state-of-the-art , multi-service clinic . <p> In May , the Nelson Meers Foundation gave $1 million to the University for Sydney towards galleries displaying a mixture of art and artefacts at the university 's Chau Chak Wing Museum . <p> Meers , a former lord mayor of Sydney , set up the first prescribed private fund ( PPF ) in Australia in 2001 and his foundation has backed many arts organisations including the Miles Franklin Literary Award , the Australian Chamber Orchestra , the Art Gallery of NSW and many more . <p> Also in May Dr Susan Alberti AC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university 's scholarship funds . <p> Alberti also took out a top award as part of the Australia Day 2016 honours list receiving a Companion of the Order of Australia , for her philanthropic and fundraising support . <p> Alberti was recognised for her service to the community , particularly through philanthropic and fundraising support for a range of medical research , education and sporting organisations , as an advocate for improved health care services for the disadvantaged , and to young women as a role model and mentor . <p> The co-founder and managing director of the Group and vice president of the Western Bulldogs AFL club , Alberti is also chair of the Susan Alberti Medical Research Foundation and the former national president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) Australia . <p> In August , the estate of the late Paula Kinnane donated $8 million to the University of Queensland in what was hailed as the biggest ever donation dedicated to the arts in Queensland .

However , just over half ( 53 per cent ) indicated that their processes had changed significantly . <p> The research found that the motivating factors for Australian philanthropists were that giving can make a difference ( 92.2 per cent ) , their desire to give back to community ( 77.7 per cent ) and the desire to set an example ( 77.7 per cent ) . <p> Philanthropists were also influenced by causes they were passionate about ( 96.2 per cent ) , whether the charity had sound governance ( 92.3 per cent ) and that their grant would provide more " bang for their buck " ( 65.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also turned their attention to health , welfare and education as part of their 2016 giving . <p> In March two Sydney family philanthropic trusts donated $1 million to launch the new Centre for Family Based Mental Health Care at St Vincent 's Hospital . <p> The Grant Family Charitable Trust and the Crouch Family made the joint donation to the St Vincent 's Curran Foundation . <p> Both philanthropic families were driven by a desire to change the face of mental healthcare in Australia , saying the donation would enable new models of care at the hospital . <p> At the same time the $1 million gift would support the development of a new dedicated mental health nursing workforce , trained by the University of Sydney , to work with families to implement the program of care . <p> A collaboration by some of Australia 's leading businessmen and philanthropists , led by education reform advocate David Gonski AC , donated more than $5 million towards students in disadvantaged schools in 2016 . <p> The Pioneers in Philanthropy group plans to deliver financial support over five years to hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include Gonski 's wife Orli Wargon OAM , Roger Massy-Greene , John B Fairfax AO and Nick Fairfax ( representing their family foundation called Jibb ) , John Grill AO and his wife Rosie Williams , Ian Narev ( representing the Commonwealth Bank ) , Angus and Sarah James and Kerry Stokes AC . <p> Retford Park <p> Philanthropist James Fairfax AC donated more than $20 million to the National Trust of Australia ( NSW Division ) gifting his historic Retford Park home along with a significant endowment for the property 's ongoing conservation and maintenance . <p> Exel is founder of the Adara Group , a corporate finance for-purpose business that funds the core support costs of the Adara Foundation , which works with communities in Nepal and Uganda to deliver essential services for women and children . <p> Exel is a lawyer , specialising in international finance .

 with all of the reform programs going on across the sector and increasing pressure from government and other funders for the sector to effectively be doing more with less , we think the pace really needs to pick up and accelerate . " <p> However , he said the sector had progressed this year in a number of ways . <p> " One is around mindset ... we 've seen a real shift in mindset , particularly in leaders in the sector , and not just in larger organisations , I think from small , medium and large organisations , " he said . <p> " We 're seeing the evidence of organisations really incorporating technology into their strategy and their business planning cycle , and that was reinforced to me just a month or so ago at the ACOSS conference , for example , where ... we were talking about digital disruption and the opportunities to use technology more effectively for the sector . <p> " Also I think some of the large-scale reforms in the sector are really forcing the sector to think about technology a bit more strategically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're going to need effective client and case management systems to deliver their services effectively , they really need to think about digital marketing and website and social media if they 're going to survive in the era of the NDIS . <p> " And finally for me it was ... some of the reforms particularly around domestic and family violence and child protection . And what we 've seen , in some states at least , is organisations working a lot more closely together , and ... technology enabling what we call service coordination . " <p> He said a major accomplishment of some organisations in the sector was using technology to improve their service delivery and empower their clients . <p> " One of the things that 's most excited me is the consumer-focused tools that we 've seen come out , " he said . <p> " And one of them has been our Ask Izzy application that we developed for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to access services . " <p> In February , Infoxchange , with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mobile website that connects homeless people , or those that are at risk of being homeless , with service providers . <p> Its initial goal was to reach 100,000 people in two years , but they managed to meet that target in the first three months , and by October it reached 200,000 . <p> " For me that 's an initial example of where we can go as a sector , actually empowering people in need with the tools and resources so that they can find services themselves , and they can be a lot more empowered with their interaction with the service system , " Spriggs said . <p> " I 'm excited about similar tools in the future in that space , particularly around areas like disability for example , empowering people to find the services that they need , to connect in with those services and be taking a more direct role in terms of management of their care . " <p> This year saw the release of two tools , and Clickability , which serve as a TripAdvisor for the NDIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers . <p> New tap-to-donate technology , which operates like PayPass and payWave , is doing away with old-fashioned collection tins . <p> And from harnessing the power of Pok ? mon Go for fundraising to using virtual reality to enhance empathy for people living with dementia , not for profits have also used technology to connect with a broader audience . <p> Spriggs said the second area of achievement was the use of big data . <p> " There 's a huge opportunity for organisations in the sector to better understand the needs of the clients they 're serving , to improve their service delivery and then kind of move on to benchmarking their organisations against other organisations to better understand their impact , " he said . <p> " We 're seeing some projects in that space , but ... that 's probably just the tip of the iceberg . " <p> Infoxchange is one of the organisations that delved into big data this year . <p> Supported by $500,000 funding from Google Australia , it will use data from its Ask Izzy app to map demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time there was both a " huge opportunity " and " huge need " for the open data platform . <p> While Ask Izzy shows where services are located , there is currently no way of knowing whether they are located in high-need areas . <p> Several resources launched in 2016 which aim to help other not-for-profit organisations use data to improve their service delivery . <p> The Centre for Social Impact created Australia 's Social Pulse , a web-enabled tool that has synthesised existing but often inaccessible -- data on social statistics . <p> It examines " domains " , including education , employment , health , housing and life satisfaction , then breaks down each domain into groups , including gender , age , people with disability , socio-economic indexes for areas of disadvantage , people with psychological distress and Indigenous Australians , to assist with better-targeted services . <p> The Minerva Collective , a Sydney-based not for profit conceived by Data Republic , was set up to connect not-for-profit organisations with data and data analysts to help them solve social problems and measure their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third area where Spriggs observed progression was the use of technology to improve in-house operations . <p> " We 've seen ... the adoption of cloud technologies by the sector , which really is a no brainer , particularly when the major cloud providers like Microsoft and Google offer their cloud-based products to the sector at no charge , " he said . <p> " And that 's an area where we 've seen a lot more adoption in the last 12 months . " <p> Vermeulen said she also noticed this improvement . <p> " I think we 're seeing a lot of organisations get a bit more experimental with things like internal collaboration tools , like using Slack team communication at work for instance , " she said . <p> " There is this understanding that not just tactics or marketing tactics need to change , but how an organisation uses technology to leverage people 's skills to collaborate , to use cloud-based tools and technology . <p> " We 're seeing organisations much more open to that , where previously IT departments would shut that down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers or within their privacy policies . <p> " There 's a more open , collaborative environment really coming to life in organisations , which hopefully leads to better outcomes . " <p> " The challenge is around allocating enough budget for IT with organisations keeping abreast with what the changes are in the sector and what the opportunities are , having access to skilled IT resources , " he said . <p> " A huge element is NGOs are spending approximately 3 per cent of their budget on IT , and in this current era of significant change and opportunity for the use of technology , I think organisations really need to be reconsidering that and need to be allocating more budget into this space , if they 're going to have that level of change . <p> " So while there 's been progress it 's got better , still there 's a significant number of organisations that have been left behind . " <p> It became increasingly apparent this year that the danger of not allocating sufficient budget towards digital technology will impact a charity 's bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of the " charity bypass " , where crowdfunding and other technologies are allowing donors to engage directly with causes , cutting out the middleman -- traditional charities . <p> Keynote speaker at the ACOSS conference in November , Burkhard Gn ? rig , also warned not for profits about the phenomenon of direct giving through technology . <p> He is the co-founder and executive director of the International Civil Society Centre , a not-for-profit organisation helping international civil society organisations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their work . <p> " I have discussions with fundraisers and I say to them : ' You ask me to give money to Save the Children Germany ... and I know before it reaches the kids in East Africa you will have deducted about 30 per cent ... then I have to wait for a year until you send me ... a report about the project , ' " Gn ? rig said . <p> " If I give directly through digital means I get 95 to 100 per cent to the project and I usually have digital means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the donation , so I do n't have to wait , I have more direct contact , more of my money goes to the people . <p> " My bet would be the next generation of donors will not even understand the alternative concept because they have been growing up with the internet ... so I think we are losing that battle and that makes us similar ... to the politicians . " <p> In order to survive digital disruption , Spriggs said he would like to see not for profits continue to evolve their mindsets in 2017 . <p> " We have seen a shift in mindset , but I think there needs to be more and more of a push to putting technology more front and centre in terms of organisation strategy and business plan , " he said . <p> " And the number one recommendation that I 'd give to organisations is , if you do n't already , get someone with IT experience on your board , not to drive IT implementation , but so you 've got that skill set at a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to assist from a strategy perspective . " <p> Vermeulen also said digital strategy needed to be " one of the most imperative " items on a not-for-profit organisation 's agenda in the new year . <p> " You see organisations like World Vision that have taken that quite seriously by appointing a new CEO that 's a digital transformation expert because it is such a saturated market , " she said . <p> " Those that are a digital organisation are the ones that are the fastest growing , the ones that can relate to donors the best , the ones that can provide the best retention , the best impact reporting . <p> " You do n't necessarily see organisations with very traditional marketing approaches or skills ... growing quickly -- you see that they have steady growth or even a declining growth . <p> " The ones that are really digitally focused are not just growing quickly but they 're appealing to younger donors that are able to grow with the organisations that they 're in , so you 're not targeting a declining demographic but @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he is

I recently moderated a panel at the NFP People Conference in Melbourne , at the beginning of which I asked how many of the audience were willing to admit to a bad hire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given the way most HR processes are conducted , it 's frankly no surprise that this is the case . <p> In a recent survey commissioned by Xref , we uncovered the startling finding that almost one-third of respondents admitted to selecting an inappropriate person to act as their professional referee , including 16 per cent who had asked a friend , and 11 per cent who had elected to put forward a family member . <p> Of course , we can all see why people would do this after all , Aunty Margaret 's never going to give you bad feedback but it 's worrying that in today 's market , with all the platforms available to provide security and support to businesses to avoid these situations , it 's still so prevalent . <p> When you consider the risks of this kind of activity in the NFP sector , with organisations that are typically dealing with vulnerable people and sensitive issues , the need to crack down on it is heightened further still . With this increased threat , and the fact that Australia is home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers , you 'd think we 'd have some standardised approaches to HR processes . But what became more and more apparent as we chatted to attendees of the conference is that we definitely do not . <p> Governance , something that 's very familiar to HR professionals in the NFP sector , and recruiting the right people go hand-in-hand in an industry that is so people focused having solutions in place that can go some way to ensuring safe and reliable hiring decisions are made , is critical . <p> The added complications of healthcare recruitment <p> During the session I moderated , we heard recruitment services manager Sally Alacqua tell us about the challenges she 's faced since joining Melbourne Health , and the solutions she 's implemented to overcome them . <p> With Victoria 's second largest trauma hospital , the Royal Melbourne Hospital , and the largest mental health service , North West Mental Health , sitting under the Melbourne Health banner , the organisation can be looking after a large proportion of the population at any one time and it employs a staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant challenges in terms of how the organisation recruits and services its workforce . <p> Having been with Melbourne Health for more than two years , Sally has had time to assess and improve the processes in place . Given the public nature of the organisation , Sally identified the number one challenge facing the HR departments of organisations such as Melbourne Health being a lack of funding given that , quite rightly , any money made available will usually be put towards something that is directly focused on patient care . <p> However , beyond the confines of operating within a limited company , Sally also highlighted a challenge many HR departments struggle with a decentralised recruitment service . At Melbourne Health , the fact that more than 2,000 people are employed annually , but recruitment is handled by the staff who would typically spend the majority of their time focusing on other very specific and time-consuming tasks , such as employment contracts or staff delivery of patient care , was a cause of concern for Sally . <p> The lack of a centralised team , focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of going straight from screening CVs to conducting interviews , meaning a lot of time is wasted in discussions with individuals that are eventually deemed inappropriate for the role . <p> The lack of a dedicated recruitment team , can also have a detrimental impact on the efficiencies of the recruitment process . Sally mentioned that upon joining Melbourne Health she noticed that often , HR professionals across a range of disciplines would be paying for similar advertising for a variety of roles and , therefore , screening the same people for different opportunities resulting in time and money wasted . <p> Finding the right solutions <p> The key requirement identified by Sally was the need to plan for the future and establish a pipeline of talent . This is particularly necessary in the healthcare industry , where there are significant skills shortages . Rather than tackle the challenge alone , Sally set about establishing a network of recruitment , talent and HR managers from similar organisations to share their concerns and solutions . <p> Another common aspect of recruitment in the healthcare sector and indeed others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire at volume . When high-volume hiring is required , efficiency and security in the processes used to identify successful candidates is crucial . <p> Ultimately , every organisation is different . While there are commonalities that we can draw on , share and learn from collectively , really understanding your own organisation , the industry and the talent pool available is critical to identifying , attracting and retaining the best people . What is true across the board is that old , traditional methods must make way for new , more efficient ways of doing things . <p> Whether that means adopting new technologies , or simply a new way of looking at a problem ( such as sharing it with a group of like-minded peers ) , all HR departments will reap the rewards of a recruitment process and practice audit . <p> About the author : Mike Brett is a NFP specialist at Xref , a Sydney-based tech startup which provides online referencing solutions for companies , big and small , globally .

 <p> " And I think that it 's important to remember that second half because when it comes to giving a gift to a non-profit organisation , at the end of the day they are done person to person , eye to eye , heart to heart , and no technology is going to replace that . <p> " Technology is an interesting tool for identifying people , for learning a lot about people , for doing lots of mass campaigns where people make small amounts of money , and that 's very important . <p> " But when it comes to making major gifts and making major contributions , that is a face-to-face experience . " <p> In his consultancy work , he tells the story of one potential donor he was interested in , and the long process it took to secure a donation . <p> " His name was Roy Disney , he was part of the Disney family , and he lived part of the year in Ireland where he had a castle and he sailed a lot , and I managed to find through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met for a cup of tea and that was lovely , " he said . <p> " Then one morning I met him again for breakfast and I asked him for $5 million . But that meeting was two-and-a-half years after I met him for a cup of tea , it was the 29th time I had met him and was the first time I asked him for money . <p> " So I guess what I 'm saying is I put two-and-a-half years of my life into building a very , very close relationship with this guy who had capacity , he was a wealthy man . But he was n't necessarily inclined towards us , so it took quite a lot of time for me to build that relationship . <p> " And I think a lot of people in fundraising just think : ' There 's a wealthy person over there , let 's knock them up for some money , ' but of course it does n't work like that . In fact wealth and generosity are n't always related . " <p> While Disney initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he returned with a figure of $3.1 million . <p> " It was still , from our point of view , a very successful solicitation , " Aikins said . <p> " It 's really , really important that people realise that people give to people at the end of the day . <p> " I say you always need three things to raise money : you need a strong case powerfully articulated , you need a constituency of support and you need leadership ... at a staff level , at a board level and at a donor level . <p> " It 's like a stool with three legs , and if you knock one leg away you know what happens to the stool . So you need those three things to be able to raise money . " <p> Even in the face of the crowdfunding movement and campaigns run entirely online , Aikins advised not to favour technology over relationships . <p> " Campaigns excite organisations , they get them onto , if you like , a war footing , and campaigns is when you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something dramatic , and donors get excited by that more so than just giving money to pay for the wages or keep the electricity on , " he said . <p> " I have this concept called B-HAGS , which is big , hairy , audacious , goals , and the fact that you need to have really inspiring and lofty and aspirational objectives , that gets people excited about what you 're doing . <p> " All the research shows the number one reason people give money to a non profit is to bring about change and to see the mission of the organisation carried out , whatever that mission is . <p> " And missions always involve change , either solving a societal i 'll or building a building or doing something to change somebody 's life , it 's all about change , so you need to focus on that .

Today , I would add a fourth essential leg : the need for a credible , reliable and measurable evidence base . <p> One of the first pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a positioning paper highlighting the need to better understand volunteering in Tasmania . This paper became our first State of Volunteering Report research letting us finally measure and understand trends in Tasmanian volunteering . Since then , VT has released two more State of Volunteering in Tasmania reports ( 2012 and 2014 ) . Each sought to understand volunteering and its incredible social , cultural and economic impact in Tasmania . Despite this , I believe we really have only touched the tip of the iceberg . The volunteer effort still goes unrecorded , unmeasured and unseen . <p> Volunteers hide in plain sight as they are embedded in the very fabric of our community . I never cease to be surprised by the number of people that tell me they " do n't have time to volunteer " , yet I inevitably find out later that they donate their time to the community in some way , they just do n't identify as volunteers . In their mind they just do what needs to be done so that they can have the kind of community they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " movers , shakers and doers " . They donate 7.1 million hours each year to make our world better . That 's a lot of people showing up , stepping up and creating change . <p> Our evidence base shows that our volunteers are not just a " nice to have " in our community . Volunteers and the organisations in which they give time are key economic and social contributors . <p> VT 's 2014 State of Volunteering Report , produced in conjunction with the Institute of Project Management , has been an absolute game changer , making an unequivocal case for investment in volunteering . Its cost benefit analysis of volunteering showed that for every $1 invested in volunteering $4 in benefits are returned to the community . Volunteering is also one of Tasmania 's most economically valuable industries , contributing $4.9 billion to our community . <p> It has been two years since VT released this unarguable economic evidence for volunteering . We 've had time to absorb its impact . It 's now time to get serious about this industry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that we , our friends , families and neighbours do . I believe our state-wide Volunteering Awards , now in its second year , will help bring this about . My vision is that Tasmania becomes known as the " giving state " and that we never hear someone say : " I 'm just a volunteer , " again . <p> But as a society , we will still need to do more . If Tasmania continues to do what it has always done , we may , if we are lucky , sustain current levels of volunteering . But if we were to heed the economic evidence and get proactive and visionary in our approach , we would see real remunerative and social returns . <p> If we took a strategic approach to volunteering and made it our mission to grow volunteer participation by 1 per cent per year , we would add an average of $70.6 million per year in value to the Tasmanian economy . In today 's economic climate that is a significant return . <p> How do we get to this point ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves . We need to have a Tasmanian Strategy for Volunteering ; something that provides a blueprint for where we need to go and how we will get there . VT has advocated for this in our 2017/18 budget priority statement to the Tasmanian government . <p> There are many challenges facing Tasmania 's volunteering sector adapting to new trends in volunteering , managing our ageing population , and growing corporate and skilled volunteering , to name but a few . Now is the time to plan for this future . If we want to live in a Tasmania that is socially , culturally and economically prosperous , we need to create an investment in the cornerstone of our community volunteering . <p> Let 's work together to encourage people to give and be part of the change they want to see in their backyard . <p> About the author : Adrienne Picone is the outgoing CEO of Volunteering Tasmania . She is taking up the position as CEO of Volunteering Australia in January 2017. 
 <p> Charity op-shops and the NSW environment minister are urging the public to help prevent turning charities into a " dumping ground " for unusable goods in the wake of the Christmas period . <p> Each year charities in Australia receive almost 800,000 tonnes of goods , of which almost a third can not be reused or recycled , leaving charities to foot a multi-million dollar bill for disposing the unwanted goods . <p> On Tuesday , Minister Mark Speakman said the Christmas and New Year period saw a peak in the number of unusable donations and he called on the public to donate responsibly . <p> " During the holiday season , charities see a spike in unusable donations and even some unscrupulous behaviour of people using street-side clothing bins as dumping grounds for food waste and other rubbish , " Speakman said . <p> " Donating unwanted goods is a great way to help those less fortunate , but as a rule of thumb if it ai n't fit for a mate , then do n't donate . " <p> The NSW government is working with the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak organisation representing Australia 's charities and charity op shops , to create awareness about responsible donations . <p> NACRO chief executive officer Kerryn Caulfield said this time of year was " heartbreaking " for the volunteers and staff who return after the break to be faced with sorting through " piles of dirty , broken household rubbish dumped amongst the donations " . <p> " The summer holiday season is a hard time of year for many Australian families struggling with poverty , so donations of good quality goods are needed by the charities to raise funds so they can deliver their services , " Caulfield said . <p> " But giving unusable or broken goods to a charity bin or op shop is not a donation it is dumping waste and the cost of disposal of this rubbish takes away funds needed for the charities ' community programs . " <p> Caulfield said Australia 's charity recyclers stand to lose millions of dollars this holiday season disposing of rubbish and unusable donations . <p> " Our research in 2016 , showed that NSW charitable recyclers spent around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unusable donations , soiled , damaged and dumped items , " Caulfield said . <p> " That money should be going to help others . <p> " We hope that by educating people on how to make their donation count we can eliminate this drain on charity resources and the volunteers and staff who have the unpleasant job of dealing with the rubbish . " <p> NACRO has issued three tips for those wanting to make donations of secondhand goods : <p> Ask yourself , would you give this item to a friend in need ( ie it 's clean , undamaged , good quality ) . <p> Donate direct to the op shop during operating hours or call to arrange pick-up for larger items . <p> Anglicare operations manager for shops and factories Julie McAuley said there were a lot of ways a considered donation could assist the community . <p> " We are always grateful for the many people who donate generously and thoughtfully . As profits from our shops fund our community programs in Sydney and the Illawarra , their contribution not only helps the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " A simple piece of clothing that one person may no longer need can also be loved again by others and put to good use . There are a lot of ways a considered donation can assist the community . " <p> The Environment Protection Authority 's Reducing Dumping on Charitable Recyclers project , part of the NSW government 's $65 million commitment to addressing illegal dumping , offers charities grants to install surveillance equipment , lighting , fencing and gates to get donors " to do the right thing " .

" <p> " When they come to the need of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of trucks and moved to the next area of available land , whether it 's government , church , privately owned , there 's lots of available land out there . We just need to get better at utilising it . " <p> Under the agreement , the Department of Health and Human Services will hold the lease , set at peppercorn rent , and sublet the land to Launch Housing . <p> The lease will be set for an initial period of five years , with a 12-month notice to vacate clause if VicRoads requires the land . <p> Launch Housing also guaranteed to rehouse the tenants if they need to be relocated . <p> The deputy CEO and director of services at Launch Housing , Dr Heather Holst , said the 57 houses would support single adults and couples who are at risk of homelessness due to the rental affordability crisis . <p> " Single adults are one of the largest groups of people currently experiencing great difficulty accessing and maintaining affordable housing right now , " Holst said . <p> " This new partnership with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need a break . They ca n't get into private rental due to the high costs and they often do n't qualify or have to wait up to a decade to access public housing . " <p> Harris encouraged other donors to see social housing as a sector that requires a whole-of-community response . <p> " Homelessness in this country is not acceptable and the main cause of homelessness currently is not mental health or drug and alcohol use , it 's people just ca n't afford rent or housing , " he said . <p> " As a nation we need to do more to provide affordable and social housing , and this is one way to achieve it . " <p> The initiative , announced Wednesday , comes as the City of Melbourne removes homeless people from the CBD ahead of the Australian Open . <p> While sleeping rough in Melbourne is legal , it is illegal to camp in a public place . <p> According to the City of Melbourne , the operation is a routine clean up . <p> " We will continue to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area and to try and find suitable alternative living arrangements , " a spokesperson said in a statement to the ABC . <p> On Tuesday , the council also removed a camp underneath Sandridge Bridge , which connects the CBD and Southbank. 
 <p> A groundbreaking new study is set to be carried out in a bid to develop a set of best practice guidelines for crisis care and suicide prevention . <p> LifeSpan , an evidence-based approach to suicide prevention developed by the Black Dog Institute and the Centre for Research Excellence in Suicide Prevention , is calling on people with professional or lived experience of suicide or self-harm to participate in the survey . <p> Researchers will use the Delphi expert consensus method to draw on both lived experience and professional expertise in a bid to outline best practice for integrated crisis and aftercare for people who are displaying suicidal behaviour , ideation or self-harm . <p> In particular the guidelines will focus on improvements in the emergency department and hospital settings . <p> " There are things that have come out through our stakeholder interviews about what may or may not be a flag or a risk marker , or what may or may not make a difference in terms of prevention that are potentially new , so I 'm interested in seeing how they are considered by the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly excited by the value we are placing on lived experience . <p> " Because I think , the retail sector knows how to send a mystery shopper in and see if retail workers are supporting all the functions that are expected of them and what the experience is like for the customer . There are obviously ethical problems in doing that in a healthcare setting , but this is one way of really valuing that lived experience and understanding what it feels like to be someone who 's sitting in an ED in crisis . <p> " I think that if we can understand that better , we 'll go a long way to understanding how to improve practice . " <p> It comes as the LifeSpan program , a $15 million research trial funded by The Paul Ramsay Foundation , is currently being implemented across four pilot sites in NSW Newcastle , Illawarra Shoalhaven , Gosford/Wyong and the Murrumbidgee with other Australian sites in the pipeline . <p> Green said LifeSpan was the name given to what they call the Systems Approach to Suicide Prevention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nine interventions , nine strategies , that when delivered together at the same time within a defined region aim to have a greater cumulative effect on suicide rates than piecemeal strategies do on their own , " she said . <p> " It is a pretty big deal , it is the first time it has been done in Australia . " <p> The first of the nine strategies focuses on crisis- and after-care , which Green said was expected to have a strong influence on suicide attempt . <p> " If someone makes a suicide attempt and gets good care and good follow up they are less likely to make a subsequent attempt and therefore less likely to die by suicide , " Green said . <p> " We actually think about 20 per cent of impact comes from that strategy alone , so it is a really important one but it is also the hardest area . <p> " What we found when getting into the research for this area was there are a lot of guidelines , there are a lot of studies that recommend things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call knowledge translation . <p> " So people have studied a particular approach and said it makes a difference but the detail that one would actually use to implement what was studied is often lacking . <p> " There is a real challenge in translating research into change in health care settings . " <p> Green said this latest study aimed to bridge the gap in " knowledge translation " and provide evidence to back practices that have not previously been researched . <p> " In our consultations with the sector and with people around the country and other researchers and clinicians , we heard a lot about different , good bits of practice people were doing but most things had n't sort of made it to being studied , so there was n't hard evidence we could go to to see if something works or not , " she said . <p> " There was a lack of clarity around some of the things the evidence recommended in around either how you would do them or how effective they might be in different sorts of contexts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example that tell you you should set up a suicide prevention team , and that 's a good idea , but what the literature does not necessarily then tell you is who 's in the team , what does the team do , what does the membership look like , how often do they meet , what is their interaction with a patient , so you can see where there is gaps in actually implementing things and often that is a common barrier to implementing guidelines . <p> " So what the Delphi consensus study does is it draws statements about what you should do from all different sources of evidence , from published literature but also from interviews with key stakeholders and conversations with people with lived experience ... and then puts all that together in a survey type format . <p> " That is then issued in a way that is methodologically rigorous to develop consensus about which of the things that you could do , are actually most important . So in that sense we think it is quite an exciting piece of work . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one for those with lived experience . <p> " What that means is that the lived experience of having been in the ED feeling suicidal or being a family member supporting someone or someone bereaved by suicide , who has been through that crisis experience , is weighted equally to that of a clinician within an emergency department , " Green said . <p> " So we are actually really able to balance that lived experience with professional experience , and out of it we aim to produce information that makes sense of some of the existing evidence and guidelines and produces guidance on what best practice might actually look like . " <p> Researchers are also calling on health professionals working within emergency settings to join the study . <p> " That 's really important because guidelines and well-meaning writers of guidelines can have a tendency to come up with long laundry lists of all the things that an ED nurse should do without necessarily being in touch with the reality of work on the ground for an ED nurse who might be casual , who might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have come through a different stream of healthcare training , " Green said . <p> " Sometimes the expectations are wrong in terms of what 's actually possible , so a study like this actually gives those clinicians an opportunity to respond to all these different possibilities of what they could do and prioritise what they think is most important . " <p> The surveys will be run between February and March . <p> People interested in taking part in the study can find more information here . 
 <p> Welcoming the new year is an opportunity to reflect upon the year that was . The recent Giving Australia 2016 report suggests that last year Australians may actually have been giving up on giving . <p> According to the research , there 's been a 6 per cent decrease in the number of Australians donating to charitable causes in 2016 . <p> Tired of charity reps stopping you in the street or calling you around dinner time ? You 're not alone -- 64 per cent of Australians dislike street fundraisers , and more than three-quarters of us dislike solicitations by telephone . <p> Although traditional fundraising methods do seem to be falling out of favour , the 2016 Charity Reputation Index has found trust in charities to be at its highest level in six years . In other words , it 's not the charities people have a problem with , but rather the methods they 're using . <p> At the same time , Australians are increasingly discerning , and more interested in how fundraisers are operating , especially from an ethical point of view . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how a charity treats their staff and how much of their donation will actually be delivered to the cause . <p> With all of this in mind , charities need to be looking at new fundraising strategies that focus on the donor experience , allowing people to feel like they 're giving directly to the cause . <p> Crowdfunding is one of these non-traditional methods seeing early success . As the name suggests , crowdfunding is when money is raised for a cause or project through contributions from a large number of people ( see recent campaigns to rebuild the Buchan Pub , or to save Larry the Lobster ) . <p> The power of crowdfunding is that due to the large number of people giving , each person can contribute what they can afford be it $5 , $20 or more . Some crowdfunding platforms also seek out organisations and philanthropists willing to match donations , effectively doubling or even quadrupling the total funds raised . <p> In a time where the Australian economy is slowing and cost of living is growing , it 's great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount , it can still have a significant impact . <p> In my work , I 've seen Australian organisations raise over a million dollars in less than 24 hours through crowdfunding , bringing together communities to rally for a cause . <p> The empowerment of everyday people to contribute within their means to help achieve a larger , tangible goal creates a unique kind of energy that often encourages people to increase their donation <p> With philanthropists and high-net worth individuals seeing giving as a financial investment , they are increasingly seeking to know where their money can have the greatest positive social impact . Something like crowdfunding let 's a philanthropist see the scale of community support for a cause , and in donating , know the support of the community will also multiply their donation . <p> Despite a number of new crowdfunding platforms emerging , and popular campaigns raising both funds and positive media attention , only 4 per cent of Australian not-for-profit organisations utilised crowdfunding in 2016 . I suspect that number will grow next year . <p> Perhaps Australians are n't really giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to give within their means , and where they know they 're more likely to achieve something significant for a cause that 's important to them . <p> As we begin 2017 , those not for profits relying solely on traditional fundraising strategies might benefit from exploring non-traditional fundraising methods as part of their new year 's resolution . Crowdfunding is a good place to start . 
 <p> Vinnies has joined the chorus of welfare organisations demanding the government suspend the Centrelink debt recovery system , saying it should not be viewed as a " weapon " of deficit reduction . <p> The call follows Human Services Minister Alan Tudge 's comments on Wednesday that the system would be retained , despite hundreds of complaints from people alleging they have incorrectly received debt notifications . <p> He defended the debt recovery scheme , which seeks to recover $4 billion in budget savings and has generated 170,000 notices of potential overpayment since July . <p> " The system is working and we will continue with that system , " Tudge told the ABC . <p> " I 'm not aware of individuals who are completely convinced that they do n't owe money but have been given a debt notice . " <p> Welfare organisations have criticised the process , which uses automated data matching to check records of people 's income , without staff involvement or oversight . <p> CEO of the St Vincent de Paul Society Dr John Falzon said the government 's response to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government appears to be in deliberate denial about the effects of this debacle on people 's lives , " Falzon told Pro Bono News . <p> " But more to the point , the government does n't seem to understand that Centrelink is an agency that should be properly resourced so that people can be helped , rather than being used in this absolutely abominable manner of trying to take away from those who have the least in order to give the government an opportunity to avoid making sure that those who have the most pay their fair share . <p> " The government is viewing Centrelink as a weapon of deficit reduction , rather than as a means of helping people . This should never be the case . <p> " Centrelink is the means by which government can ensure that cash transfers can be made to people who are suffering the effects of inequality in prosperous Australia . It should n't be used in this absolutely unconscionable manner of hounding people and intimidating people for money that , in fact , they do n't owe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ombudsman launched an independent investigation into the system . <p> Falzon said the scheme should be suspended while the flaws are investigated . <p> " Let 's see the government put an immediate hold to this scandalous process of deliberately hounding people and humiliating people and intimidating people , " he said . <p> " There should be a cessation of the letters being sent out , and those who have already received the letters should not need to have anything to worry about . <p> " And let 's be honest , if there has been some kind of error made by Centrelink through no fault of the social security benefit recipient , then why should that recipient , who is struggling ... be placed in a situation where they are being hit over the head with an unmanageable debt . <p> " We need to think very carefully about the effects on people 's lives who 've been told all of a sudden that they 've got a debt that , in proportionate terms , is quite significant and they 're struggling to make ends meet from week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian Council of Social Service ( ACOSS ) also repeated its call for an immediate suspension of the debt recovery system . <p> " Centrelink has demonstrably failed in its duty of care to ensure accurate information is provided to recipients of income support and this failure is causing undue stress , anxiety and harm to some of our most vulnerable people , " acting ACOSS CEO Peter Davidson said . <p> " In December , we wrote to the minister calling for the immediate suspension of the debt recovery program because of the systemic problems with the data-matching system . <p> " The government has a duty of care towards people who call on it for support , especially those on low incomes . It has breached that duty of care with this debt recovery program , which is why the program must cease in its current form to prevent further harm . <p> " We are hugely concerned that people are paying back debts that they do not owe because it is too hard to prove that they do not owe it . Where people have issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Centrelink on the phone and are not receiving the help they need at Centrelink offices . " <p> The Greens went further , calling for the system to be scrapped entirely and for the investigation to be referred to a Senate inquiry . <p> " I 'm pleased the Ombudsman will be reviewing this debacle but the Parliament needs to hear from the people affected by this flawed approach , " Greens community services spokesperson Senator Rachel Siewert said . <p> " When Parliament resumes I will work with Senate colleagues to initiate a Senate inquiry into the debacle . We need clear answers on how this program went so wrong and what the real implications are . " <p> Falzon said the system was also having an impact on charitable organisations , who were dealing with an increase in requests for assistance . <p> " People are already struggling on a meagre income support payment and so organisations like Vinnies end up being the default means of providing the social security top up . This should end , surely we can do better as a nation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely frightened because they 've received a letter saying that they allegedly owe some proportionately enormous amount of money , then yes , they do come to organisations like ours . <p> " The government seems to be very insensitive to the fact that people are plunged more deeply into despair and fear when they receive letters like this . And then of course ... they need to depend more heavily on charitable assistance from us and from other organisations . It 's an absolute mess , whichever way you look at it . " 
 <p> Former cricketer Shane Warne 's charity has been cleared of any wrongdoing related to its fundraising activities after the wrap up of a Consumer Affairs investigation . <p> The watchdog began its 11-month investigation into The Shane Warne Foundation in February last year after concerns were raised about the charity 's reporting and accounting practices . <p> Largely this was due to the foundation 's " inconsistent and late " reporting about its financial affairs . <p> Consumer Affairs director Simon Cohen said in a public statement that no more-serious instances of misconduct were found . <p> " The inquiries demonstrate non-compliance by the foundation with some provisions of the Fundraising Act , in particular , requirements to submit annual accounts in a timely manner , " Cohen said . <p> " Importantly , the inquiries have not otherwise found evidence of unlawful conduct or a failure on the part of the foundation to give the net proceeds of appeals to named beneficiaries . " <p> However , he advised the foundation in October 2016 that he was considering whether to deregister it due to the low proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first five years of operation , from 2005 , the foundation reported that a high proportion of funds were delivered to its beneficiaries , approximately 70 per cent each year . <p> However , since then , the watchdog said the foundation had distributed a low proportion of funds to beneficiaries . <p> " A cause of this was the foundation 's high level of expenses when compared to its income , " Cohen said . <p> Fairfax also reported that from 2011 to 2013 the foundation passed on just 16 cents of every dollar it raised . <p> According to the fundraising registration guidelines , fundraisers that distribute less than 35 per cent of funds raised must justify why they should still be registered . <p> However , the foundation announced its intention to close in January 2016 , and then in December entered an undertaking with Consumer Affairs to wind up as soon as practicable and cease all fundraising activities . <p> Cohen said this meant no further action was required . Consumer Affairs will still monitor the foundation 's activities as it closes . <p> Warne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected CAV and the Commonwealth charity regulators have cleared The Shane Warne Foundation of any wrong doing besides one late lodging of annual accounts by the due date in 2015 , " he said on Facebook . <p> " The foundation , myself , management , ambassadors and the board have always maintained that nothing inappropriate had occurred and now it 's official after these thorough investigations . <p> " It 's disappointing one particular media publication continued to run inaccurate and baseless articles that mislead the public . Thank you to everyone for their unwavering support , it has meant a lot to all of us . " <p> The Shane Warne Foundation also released a statement announcing its next steps . <p> " The foundation announced its intention to wind up in January 2016 . Since that time , it has spent significant resources responding to inquiries from the Victorian and Commonwealth charity regulators , " it said . <p> " Now that those inquiries are complete , with no finding of any wrongdoing relating to its fundraising activities , the foundation will take all steps necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final distribution to its beneficiaries . " <p> The foundation said more than $4 million had been distributed to 130 charities that help sick and underprivileged children since its launch .

It has resulted in a significant increase in the number of current and former welfare recipients assessed as having been overpaid and required to repay debts . <p> But debt problems do not really appear to be the fault of IT failure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to reflect an over-simplistic application of policy to the complexity of workers ' lives in a flexible labour market . <p> Earlier , Social Services Minister Christian Porter , who is not directly responsible for Centrelink , described the approach as " about as reasonable a process as you could possibly derive " . He claimed the system was actually working " incredibly well " , with a complaint rate running at 0.16 per cent or only 276 complaints from 169,000 letters . <p> Porter also said that 20 per cent of review letters were sent to people who did not owe anything . <p> However , he claimed these were not debt letters , but simply asked for more information to explain a discrepancy between employment data held by Centrelink and the Australian Tax Office ( ATO ) . <p> The former head of the government 's Digital Transformation Office , Paul Shetler , has described this error rate as " cataclysmic " . <p> The current controversy appears to arise from changes proposed by the Coalition during the 2016 election campaign , and related changes introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported by Labor : <p> introduced an interest charge on the debts of former recipients of social welfare payments who were unwilling to enter repayment arrangements <p> brought in Departure Prohibition Orders for people who were not in repayment arrangements for their social welfare debts <p> removed the six-year limitation on debt recovery for all social welfare debt . <p> Centrelink 's procedures appear to have several problems that can give rise to incorrect debt assessments . One problem is the names of employers provided to the ATO and Centrelink do not always match , and some people are having the same income counted twice . This is because the assessment process appears to match names rather than Australian Business Numbers . <p> A more significant problem is that when individuals are asked to confirm their annual income reported to the ATO , the formula used by Centrelink can produce false estimates of debts by dividing by 26 the annual wages employers report paying . This approach will only work correctly if individuals receive exactly the same income each fortnight . <p> For students , this is very unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coincide with the tax year , so someone who combines part-time work and study , and then graduates and moves into full-time work , is likely to have six months at a much higher wage and therefore potentially incur a debt . <p> Similarly , people who move between different jobs , or who have short interruptions to work and claim sickness benefits because they are casuals and not entitled to paid leave , are also potentially exposed to debts under Centrelink 's approach . <p> So , apart from those who are deliberately understating their earnings , it is people who move from welfare to work who are most exposed to having debts miscalculated . <p> Systems do n't reflect the reality <p> A large share of Australians experience income changes over the course of a year . This reflects family and demographic changes in partnership status or numbers of children and labour market changes , such as starting , changing or stopping jobs . <p> Data for Australia suggest high levels of labour market flows . The most recent data show that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people changed their work status . While the average number of unemployed people in each month of 2011 was around 600,000 , overall 1.7 million people looked for work at some time during the year . But , of these , fewer than 150,000 ( 8 per cent ) spent the whole year looking for work . <p> The Australian Bureau of Statistics ' 2013 Labour Mobility Survey shows that in February 2013 , there were 11.5 million people aged 15 years and above who were working . Of these , more than two million had worked for their employer for less than 12 months . <p> About half of these had changed their employer/business in the last 12 months . A further one million had not changed their employer because they either were not working 12 months earlier , or they had multiple jobs , or were temporary or seasonal workers . <p> The degree of mobility is related to the type of job people held . Those most likely to have been with their current employer/business for 10 years or more were managers ( 38 per cent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative workers ( 28 per cent ) . <p> The occupation groups with the highest proportion of people who had worked with their current employer/business for less than 12 months were generally lower paid . They included sales workers , labourers and community and personal service workers ( all 25 per cent ) , and machinery operators and drivers ( 21 per cent ) . <p> The industry with the highest proportion of people who had been with their current employer/business for less than 12 months -- about one-third was accommodation and food services . This is an area where young people and students are particularly likely to work . <p> Between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the more than one million people who received Austudy , Newstart or various forms of Youth Allowance for study or apprenticeships in 2014/15 were not on any income-support payments in the following year . <p> Around half of the 375,000 people receiving either Youth Allowance ( other ) for the unemployed or Parenting Payment Single also completely left the income-support system in that year . This is because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been one of social security policy 's main objectives for all sides of politics for many years . <p> The debt controversy has sometimes been blamed on " faulty IT " or the application of inappropriate " big data " approaches . Rather , it is the assumption of regular and unchanging income that is a major problem .

 <p> Building a Culture of Social InnovationWednesday , 18th January 2017 at 8:05 am <p> Mike Davis , founder of Purposeful , explains how a positive workplace culture fosters social innovation in an organisation . <p> LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman recently presented a " Disobedience " award at an MIT conference on research and social innovation . The award for social innovation went to " those working to right society 's wrongs " . <p> This award evolved from an original blog post by Joi Ito from March 2016 on the same subject . Ito makes the case that social innovation requires a willingness of people to question the rules and systems , particularly where they appear to be producing unfair or unreasonable outcomes . <p> This made me think about the role that trust and courage play in the workplace . Are these key elements that organisations need to promote social innovation ? Are we creating environments where people speak out if they can see things are not working ? <p> Trust <p> If we want our people to speak up when there is an issue , they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued , wanted and actioned . Embracing trust allows you to find some great allies in the most unlikely places . <p> A true ally will give you honest feedback and tell you if there is something wrong with your idea or a way to enhance it . This honest exchange will then elevate the relationship and allow future safe open exchanges . <p> Wharton Professor Adam Grant makes the point that our workplace " challengers " or adversaries are our best friends when it comes to developing robust and creative ideas . <p> In Originals , Grant profiles Bridgewater Associates and their unique culture which prioritised original thinking , trust , honesty and openness above all else . <p> One of the guiding principles at Bridgewater Associates is : " Do n't let ' loyalty ' stand in the way of truth and openness . " This approach welcomes dissent , evaluates performance based on it and may even sanction people for not dissenting enough ! <p> Courage <p> We must reward our people 's acts of courage . Courage is being able to admit that you 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful that your own people are able to , and want to , challenge your thinking . <p> Courage is embracing failure and knowing that every failure brings you closer to success . Thomas Edison said it best : <p> " I have not failed 10,000 times . I have not failed once . I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work . " <p> Courage is often considered a character trait , but I 'd rather think of it as an attribute that can be cultivated and encouraged in the right environment . Everyone is capable of acts of courage and acting courageously . <p> We can express this thanks internally to all our people and create a space where the best ideas have the room to breathe and grow . To take this full circle , these ideas can be championed at all levels and our people can take ownership of them . <p> Since 1981 , Apple has given an annual award to people who exemplify courage by challenging Steve Jobs , and promoting them to run major divisions of the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation , but a good start might be to say it is the ability to leverage social capital to create inspired and passionate communities . <p> Organisations that foster social innovation build critical emergent , adaptive and generative abilities to solve problems . Knode 's diagram provides an excellent explanation of the drivers and potential of social innovation . <p> Here a few examples of organisations that have been able to socially innovate through cultures of openness , trust and courage to question : <p> Santropol Roulant is a meals-on-wheels organisation that also runs its own sustainable composting operation . This is what their people say about them : " It 's an organisation that focuses on the individual , on the human at the centre , " and : " This place grows goodness . " <p> Adobe are known for their ability to create innovative software and service solutions . Part of the reason for this is their trusting culture , where managers adopt the role of " coaches " and trust their people to use their talent and skills to produce the best creative solutions . Risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warby Parker makes beautiful glasses frames and prescription lenses . To ensure their early success , the founders of Warby Parker instigated regular 360 review sessions . This ensures that open communication , trust and honesty are built into business as usual and form part of the culture . Co-founder Neil Blumenthal attributes this innovation as core to developing Warby Parker 's open and honest culture . <p> Hopefully , the examples above have provided good food for thought and possible actions in what can be some of the biggest challenges for developing a workplace culture of social innovation fostering trust and courage . <p> About the author : Mike Davis is the founder of Purposeful , a social impact advisory dedicated to empowering businesses to grow their social impact and performance by adopting a purpose-driven approach to community , partnerships , strategy and people and culture .

" <p> Policy manager of Council for Homeless Persons Kate Colvin told Pro Bono News : " Recent coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention on the wrong end of the problem . <p> " Vilifying people sleeping rough does not help them , splashing the faces of people in crisis in the paper only further stigmatises and isolates them , and fuels public fear and resentment . <p> " Last year there was a series of stories about aggressive beggars and in the immediate aftermath people who were visibly homeless on the street reported an increased number of nasty comments and verbal abuse from passers-by . I think it gives permission to people to direct their anger at others when what we are seeing is a symptom of a failure of government policy . <p> " These are the people already suffering from the failure of government and to add to that already difficult situation this is only adding to their shame . It 's appalling . " <p> The open letter said : " The real shame was that this crisis has been with us for some time , and it is only now that it has become visible in our streets that there is outrage and reaction . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response with public health and safety , and homelessness services are working hard to engage with chronically disadvantaged people , some of whom have complex needs . <p> " But until something is done about the national housing crisis that underpins this problem , we are simply bailing water on a sinking boat . The irony of reading news coverage of property investor borrowing skyrocketing alongside coverage of the homelessness crisis is not lost on us . <p> These two issues are intrinsically linked , and until we join the dots , we 'll never solve the crisis . " <p> Colvin said reports of people on the streets declining offers of accommodation ignore the fact that the housing offered is usually a few nights in a rooming house , or a refuge . <p> " Like you and me , what people who are homeless want is a safe , affordable and , most importantly , permanent place to call home , " she said . <p> " To provide this we urgently need more public and community housing . The poor have been squeezed out of the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people waiting for public housing . " <p> The Victorian government has committed more than $600 million to social housing and homelessness support largely in response to the Royal Commission into Family Violence . <p> " However , we are still awaiting the Victorian affordable housing strategy , " Colvin said . <p> " Our federal government is a long way from having a plan to tackle this problem . Meanwhile , those on lowest incomes are being pursued by automated Centrelink debt notices , reducing their already meagre incomes . This will inevitably increase homelessness . <p> " We are already hearing from agencies where a number of people have mentioned they have received debt letters . We are waiting to see the fallout from this in the next few months as more people struggle to hang on to their homes . " <p> The CEOs of Victoria 's leading homelessness , housing and social service organisations said they have been raising this problem for a long time , and it was n't going to go away overnight . <p> " The way to solve rough sleeping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent , affordable housing , and , when needed , the intensive supports to go with it , " they said . <p> " We 're calling on the media and policy makers to maintain their focus on the real shame of the lack of action on housing affordability . <p> " We need to get on with making the hard decisions that will solve our community 's housing problem . So many people have more than one house and so many more have no home at all . "

Lina Caneva spoke to CEO Sarah Davies about the changes for 2017 and beyond . <p> Philanthropy Australia 's CEO Sarah Davies has now been in the top job since November 2015 . <p> Even in that short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving " have changed significantly both in Australia and globally and a new strategic plan for the organisation has required an evolutionary approach rather than a revolutionary approach . <p> " When developing our 2017 to 2020 strategic map , we had to balance our rich heritage with the ' now ' and the future . We had to recognise the incredible expertise and resources of our traditional members and to their commitment to philanthropy . But we also needed to acknowledge that philanthropy is changing , " Davies said . <p> " We needed to respond to the emergence of new types of philanthropists , social entrepreneurs , new ways of giving , new ways of investing corpus , changing and blurring relationships between ' givers ' and ' receivers ' and the growing realisation that the social sector was very much part of the philanthropic community and they have as much of an interest in our success as do the funders . We also understood that corporates and intermediaries are critical to the success of our community . <p> " We have spent a lot of time looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next five to 10 years . How do we adapt and accommodate and take advantage of the opportunities it presents and how to we defend ourselves against some of the challenges that it might present . " <p> She said for the organisation , the drivers for change were simply about how philanthropy as a broad practice was evolving and changing and adapting and growing . <p> However , Davies said one of the keys to Philanthropy Australia 's future success would be to change the way their supporters and members engaged with the organisation and the need to democratise the existing membership model . <p> One of the big ticket items in the strategic plan is a new business model around membership that moves away from determining grant-maker membership categories and fees based on annual distributions . <p> " This will mean that our members will be able to select the membership package that suits their needs , where price is related to the level of benefits offered and received , " Davies said . <p> " We need to be relevant and confident that we add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a business-like sense that is sustainable and viable . <p> " We are no different to any other not-for-profit organisation . Our business model is 40 years old and the world has changed rapidly and we need to evolve this model so that it is viable in the next five to 10 years and I have no doubt that in seven or eight years we are going to have to have another go at evolving it . <p> " We need a business model to address the changes in philanthropy that makes sense . <p> " It is not about adding a whole bunch of products and services to our portfolio ... that is not going to help anybody , but it is about being clear about our contribution to that community but the community needs to be broader and more inclusive . " <p> Davies was quick to point out that the membership re-categorisation would not take effect until 2018 . <p> " We will communicate the new packages and options well before the changes take place . " <p> Philanthropy Australia will also be seeking grant-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the advancement of philanthropy . <p> Davies said another key to their ongoing success would be changing from an incorporated association to a company limited by guarantee . <p> " In a really simple sense we are an incorporated association in Victoria which sort of means we can never hold an AGM outside of Victoria and that 's just not relevant in today 's world . <p> " We are a national organisation and we have members all over the country and we want to engage and service them nationally and we need to be flexible and agile in that . <p> " Secondly there are challenges in conceiving and designing and managing a skills-based governance structure for a council or a board ... because despite the desire and intent and the work that it does you ca n't actually deliver it . <p> " The third reason is around the use of language . Under the incorporated associations act the word ' member ' has a very clear meaning and also under the corporations act as well , but there is a greater restriction around how we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great strengths of PA is the membership culture and the membership behaviour and the membership value ... we really are committed to being a membership organisation in that sense but ... the use of that word in an incorporated association is currently a bit complex . " <p> Davies said the legal change would separate more clearly the appropriate structure and behaviour and expectation of governance and proxy ownership in a not for profit and the culture and the purpose of the stakeholder group . <p> " The traditional definition of the funder , , grant maker , grant-seeker they are all becoming incredibly blurred and so we really want to embrace the contemporary and future philanthropic actors and approaches as they evolve and emerge without being constrained . " <p> She said there was an expectation that PA will hold a special general meeting in the later part of 2017 to ratify any moves to changes the legal structure . <p> Davies said policy and advocacy would continue to be the core role of Philanthropy Australia in 2017 and that the current and emerging issues were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , as a membership organisation and a peak body , that at our core is the policy and advocacy piece and without a doubt it is our kind of beating heartland , " she said . <p> " I think our significant advocacy points in the next couple of years are going to be about defending philanthropy . <p> " My hunch is that as Australia faces the federal government 's revenue challenges there could be some storm clouds gathering over the suite of incentives that are used to encourage people to be philanthropic and make deductible donations ... that will be huge . <p> " We did ok on the franking credits last year and a lot of work was done and I suspect that will come back on the list at some point . <p> " There 's a DGR review going on . We have got to really watch that and be active in understanding what the implications are and what it might mean and the whole issue of advocacy and funding advocacy we know has a got a red hot vibe that we are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' provisions and what might happen there . <p> " As well there are the things that might just be urban myths and rumours or muted comments around limiting deductions in the financial period . So , you know , we have got some major issues . " <p> Davies said along with all these issues PA was pushing for innovation and incentives to grow philanthropy . <p> " So we are still pushing for different types of changes and structure and rules that will encourage and incentivise more philanthropy . One of the big ones is how to encourage more charitable . What are the range of models and incentives that we could put into play that people can take advantage of in their lifetime but actually guarantee increase philanthropic and charitable giving through . <p> " We are still pushing hard on ideas and innovation into how we continue to feed and grow the philanthropic ecosystem . <p> " We are only going to be as effective as the quality of our relationships with our members , with the philanthropic community , with the not-for-profit community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a lone voice . We can never be a lone voice . We are one part of this and I think we are pretty clear about the part that we can play but need to do it with everybody else . This is a collective . " 
 <p> Jack de Groot , CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society NSW , is determined to collaborate with governments and investors to boost the much needed affordable housing supply in that state . <p> While New South Wales Planning Minister Rob Stokes has shown a willingness to tackle the state 's housing affordability crisis , his recently released proposal to change planning laws does little to address the problem . <p> Minister Stokes has entered the 2017 year with resolve . Long may this initial foray to confront the housing affordability crisis facing tens of thousands of families continue to grow . The impact of the minister 's commitment will be measured by the inclusion of those currently excluded from social and affordable housing throughout NSW . <p> St Vincent de Paul Society NSW has started 2017 with a call to action , optimism and a sense of the possible . Research shows we need 100,000 new social and affordable homes in NSW over the next 20 years to combat the current 10-year waiting list for social and affordable housing . To remain hopeful at the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSW from the minister 's proposed amendments to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 . <p> As many start the return to work or contemplate their last weeks of camping , beach-time or staycations at home , let 's just remember that only weeks ago many families across the state on the cusp of poverty were receiving Christmas hampers from charities and dreading the mounting debts , low paid jobs or no work and possibly chronic illness , addiction and violence that await them . <p> Housing costs are arguably the single biggest driver of poverty and disadvantage in Australia . <p> With the cost of housing rising at twice the rate of inflation over the last 10 years , housing is the largest area of expenditure for Australian households . When over 30 per cent of income goes to accommodation , the result is housing stress . It is estimated 875,000 households in Australia are experiencing housing stress right now . <p> The release of Minister Stokes ' proposed changes to planning laws so far seem to do little to alleviate this problem . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane policies in terms of housing affordability . Social dislocation and economic disadvantage caused by the inability to deliver affordable housing requires urgent and meaningful measures . <p> Right now , we are n't seeing enough action on this front . We hear a lot about how Australian cities are ranked among the least affordable in the world for purchasing a home . The flow-on effect is the lack of affordable housing for those who will never be able to buy a property . So let 's resolve that the debate about affordability of housing gets creative and moves from mortgages to meeting the fundamental need and right for all to safe and stable housing . Minister Stokes can start to expand on his initial modest proposals . <p> So here is my resolution for 2017 in regard to housing affordability : <p> Commonwealth , state and local governments must work together with institutional investors and the not-for-profit sector to ensure that affordable and safe housing is available for everyone , regardless of their financial situation . <p> The Commonwealth parliamentary inquiry report into housing affordability released in mid-December made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed back to state and territory governments the need to address land supply issues . <p> We launched a petition late last year calling on the state government to change planning laws so that at least 15 per cent of new residential developments are set aside for affordable housing , where rent is less than 30 per cent of income . There is no mention of a target in Minister Stokes ' Summary of Proposals announced this week . <p> Our members are active in their local communities generating support and signatures and we have almost reached our target . When we have 10,000 signatures we will be delivering the petition to Parliament House , where the issue will then be debated . <p> We will also be making a submission as part of the government 's consultation process . <p> At the same time , local government should be commended . Sydney 's Inner West Council has announced that all developments larger than 1,700 square metres will have to include a 15 per cent affordable housing target . <p> This is the stuff of resolution that makes people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us crave as we start a new year . Vinnies is ready . We want to create a year that sees collaboration between <p> governments , industry and the community . A year where the gaps between the haves and the havenots does not grow any further . It 's time for resolution that sustains people through 2017 and the years to come . Minister Stokes is a key player in achieving that vision as he leads a reform of <p> planning laws that must aim to deliver inclusion and housing security for those most vulnerable . <p> About the author : Jack de Groot joined St Vincent de Paul Society NSW as chief executive officer on 1 August 2016 .

 <p> The deadline for most registered charities to submit their 2016 Annual Information Statement is now only one week away . Here are some submission tips from acting commissioner of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) David Locke ahead of the due date . <p> The deadline for most registered charities to submit their 2016 Annual Information Statement is now only one week away . Here are some submission tips from acting commissioner of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ( ACNC ) David Locke ahead of the due date . <p> As of now , approximately 17,000 registered charities still need to submit their Annual Information Statement before 31 January . I 'm calling on these registered charities to please not delay and to submit as soon as possible . <p> Here are a few tips to help your charity file its 2016 Annual Information Statement accurately , and on time . <p> Do n't leave it until the last minute <p> January is our busiest time of the year in terms of call volumes . In January 2016 , we received over 3,700 calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . So if you leave your Annual Information Statement until the last minute and need assistance , we may not be able to help you . <p> As you can imagine , with up to 17,000 charities logging into theCharity Portal over the next week , our systems are likely to be slower . This will be particularly the case in the last few days . Thousands of charities file in the last 48 hours . So do n't leave it till the last moment . <p> On or just prior to the Annual Information Statement due date we see an influx of requests for extensions . Most of these are refused , but they take up ACNC staff time where we could be helping people who are trying to submit . <p> The ACNC Act states that registered charities must submit an Annual Information Statement , and for medium and large charities annual financial reports , each year within six month of the charity 's financial year end . <p> This means that registered charities have a full six months in which they can file . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly and in other materials such as ACNC Quarterly and the Commissioner 's Column . <p> We do not provide extensions to charities that simply forget , or claim that they were unaware of the due date . Extensions can only be granted in certain circumstances , for example : <p> severe illness <p> natural disasters <p> catastrophic system issues ( not just system slowness ) . <p> Before you start , read/watch our guidance <p> To help charities submit their Annual Information Statement and annual financial report quickly and easily , we have developed a range of guidance materials . I recommend that charities review at least some of these before logging into the Charity Portal to start their submission . <p> Last year we found a significant number of reporting errors when reviewing the 2015 Annual Information Statements reported by registered charities . In fact , we contacted nearly 7,000 charities to request that they correct the errors that we had identified and re-submit their Annual Information Statement . <p> Some of the common errors included : <p> misclassifying the charity as a basic religious charity when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounding ( as opposed to entering the full number ) and decimal point errors <p> submitting incomplete financial reports , for example , forgetting to sign them where required or uploading the wrong document . <p> Please take care to avoid such errors when submitting your 2016 Annual Information Statement , as it will avoid the need to resubmit later in the year . <p> Update your charity 's responsible person details <p> A charity 's responsible persons are the people responsible for running the charity , normally the board or committee members . For the first time we have included the option to update these as part of the Annual Information Statement . Please make sure that we have all your responsible people listed and that their details are up to date . <p> Update your charity 's Address for Service <p> The Address for Service is the address the ACNC holds for your charity , it 's where we will send all official correspondence . <p> The vast majority of charities have an email address as their Address for Service . As is often the case in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . Similarly , people may leave the charity , taking with them the official Address for Service email account . <p> This is why we always recommend making your charity 's email Address for Service a generic , corporate style account , for example something like . <p> The 2016 Annual Information Statement gives charities an opportunity to check and update their official Address for Service . Please make sure the Address for Service we have for your charity is correct . If this is wrong then none of the ACNC 's correspondence or reminders will reach you . <p> Make sure you submit , do n't just save <p> It may seem an obvious point to raise , however hundreds of charities each year log on and complete their Annual Information Statement , only to forget to click " submit " , instead clicking " save " . The charity is sure they have filed , but actually is in breach . It 's an easy mistake to make , so please double check . <p> If you have successfully submitted , you will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you 've submitted your Annual information Statement , there 's no need to phone us to confirm that we have it <p> In addition to receiving a confirmation email , you can check your charity 's listing on theCharity Register to make sure that your Annual Information Statement has been submitted . It is published once you have submitted it . <p> There is no need to call us to tell us that you have lodged . <p> There 's no need to send in hard copy documents <p> Over the past three years many charities have posted a hard copy of their Annual Information Statement and associated documents even though they have submitted on line . Once the Annual Information Statement has been submitted via the Charity Portal , you will receive an email notification , there 's no need to send us anything in hard copy . <p> Remember , we 're always here to help <p> The best place to start is our range of guidance materials available here . <p> However , you can always call our friendly Advice Services team by calling 13 ACNC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need further assistance . <p> This is the busiest time of year and we receive many more calls than usual , so please be patient and use the resources available online if you can . 
 <h> Lack of Affordable Housing in the Jewish Community <p> Issues being raised by Victoria 's homelessness and housing organisations parallel the experience of being on the front line of the current affordable housing crisis in the Victorian Jewish community , writes Hugh Cattermole and Melinda Kidgell . <p> Lack of Affordable Housing in the Jewish , 25th January 2017 at 3:39 pm <p> Issues being raised by Victoria 's homelessness and housing organisations parallel the experience of being on the front line of the current affordable housing crisis in the Victorian Jewish community , writes Hugh Cattermole and Melinda Kidgell . <p> Jewish Care is an unfunded provider of housing services to our community . Jewish Care addresses the root causes of homelessness , and provides transitional housing support to those experiencing homelessness , or those at risk of homelessness . <p> Each issue raised in the letter parallels the experience of being on the front line of the current affordable housing crisis in the Victorian Jewish community . We also urgently need more housing the numbers just do n't add up . <p> There have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however what we have seen escalate in the previous 12 months is the numbers of people in the Victorian Jewish community being squeezed out of the private rental market . This has had a significant impact on the poor and those on a fixed or low income . <p> Over the past four weeks alone , Jewish Care has supported seven families and three individuals who have had their private rental agreements terminated , having received notices to vacate due to market-driven conditions ( rent increases in a competitive market , renovation , redevelopment and sale ) . Once these families and individuals are squeezed out of private rental , in many instances they will not be able to compete for the very few affordable rental properties still available within the community . <p> In the current market , those who have private rental arrangements or who are sustaining mortgages are paying 50 to 55 per cent of their income on their housing costs , which leaves limited funds to meet basic material needs of food , education , clothing , gas , and electric . Housing that is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's income . <p> In the absence of having additional affordable housing stock , we simply will not be able to keep up with the growing need . <p> Jewish Care has limited stock of available housing and provides interim support until much-needed , long-term accommodation is made available . In particular , the letter draws observation around rejected offers of accommodation . We believe this is especially relevant given the needs of the Jewish community . Unsuitable offers do little to alleviate the long-term issues and can in fact compound them . We know the strength of our community partly stems from the proximity to vital infrastructure that supports our connections . Access to schools , synagogues and community are all examples of this , and where an offer is made that is not supported by this infrastructure it may be incompatible for our community members in need . <p> Until now , there has n't been a more acute need for change in the community . When private rental properties have become unaffordable , and public housing is unavailable or unsuitable , the solution for housing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only come from the community . <p> We need to invest thoughtfully and proactively in housing options that address all parts of the housing continuums , which must include both the direct provision of social and affordable housing in the heart of the Jewish community , and considered interventions that address the social impact of the current private rental market . <p> Jewish Care welcomes the Victorian Government 's commitment of over $600 million towards social housing and homelessness support , and will continue to advocate for the needs of the individuals and families in our community . 
 <h> Breakfast is the Most Important Meal of the Day <p> Ian Steel OAM is the founder and CEO of KickStart for Kids , a not-for-profit organisation that helps school children achieve positive educational and self-esteem outcomes through breakfast , lunch and mentoring programs . <p> Breakfast is the Most Important Meal of the DayMonday , 30th January 2017 at 8:53 am <p> Ian Steel OAM is the founder and CEO of KickStart for Kids , a not-for-profit organisation that helps school children achieve positive educational and self-esteem outcomes through breakfast , lunch and mentoring programs . He is this week 's Changemaker . <p> In 2009 , Steel noticed that some of the at-risk primary children he was mentoring were always hungry and could not concentrate properly . <p> After consulting with teachers and students he discovered that on average 10 to 15 per cent of kids in lower socioeconomic areas were coming to school without breakfast and lunch . <p> Steel , a builder by trade , started making sandwiches to take to schools before he went to work . <p> In 2011 he founded KickStart for Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social or economic background , should have an equal chance . <p> Today KickStart for Kids supports more than 300 South Australian schools , providing around 40,000 breakfasts and 10,000 sandwiches a week . <p> The organisation has also grown to include mentoring programs and a vacation camp . <p> On Australia Day 2017 Steel was recognised in the General Division of the Order of Australia for his service to children through social welfare programs . <p> In this week 's Changemaker , he talks about making thousands of sandwiches , why education is power and the awful things that that rocked his world . <p> How did you go from being a builder to launching KickStart for Kids ? <p> I have worked with young , disadvantaged kids for a long time . Going out and mentoring young kids , going into lower socioeconomic areas of Adelaide , I did that with the education department for about five or six years and during that time I noticed a massive behaviour difference between the kids at the schools I was mentoring and , I 'm also a junior footy coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more affluent suburbs . <p> There were kids who were angry all the time , they had high levels of anxiety , they were getting asked to leave the classroom , they were late all the time or they were n't coming to school . So I started doing some research about the issue , just on my own , I would speak to teachers and principals and social workers in the area , and while I was doing that , the information I was getting was horrifying . So I then started to do some more research . I 'd go out and speak to these kids and speak to carers and guardians and go out to where they live and what I saw was amazing . <p> I saw kids that did n't have any toys , did n't have any belongings , did n't have any clothes , all they had was their school uniform . I saw kids living in cars , on their own , kids having to go down to the park and raid the bins to find food ... I found kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were starting school , did n't know what a book was when they were starting school , I found 11-year-old kids that had no hope at all , they were already downtrodden , they 'd already given up at 11 or 12 . There were 14-year-old girls getting pregnant , 10-year-old girls talking about getting pregnant , 11-year-old boys with needle marks in their arms , the list goes on really and so where I realised I could n't tackle all of the social issues they were having to deal with , what I realised was that they needed to get educated to pull themselves out of the poverty cycle that they were in and that their families had been in for generations and generations . The only way to do that was to get somewhere that they all go and that was school , so I got the idea of breakfast programs , so I started up a breakfast program and off we went . <p> What difference does having breakfast make to these kids ? <p> Basically I went out to the more fringe residential areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast program there before work and I filled up my ute , went down to the local shopping centre and told them the story and the bakeries donated a loaf and what have you , I went and loaded up my ute and set up a breakfast program and almost instantaneously the kids changed into normal , beautiful , fun-loving kids . They became happy , they wanted to make friends , they were n't angry anymore , they wanted to come to school and they wanted to be on time because they knew there was food at the end of it . <p> But you know how you feel when you get hungry , you ca n't do anything , you ca n't concentrate , you ca n't work , so times that by 10 and that 's how the kids are feeling and there 's no way that they can get educated . But as soon as they have breakfast they settle down and become valuable members of the classroom . It only takes three months . <p> We also run mentoring programs , so we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools as well as the lunch program , so we make 8,000 sandwiches every week as well , because obviously kids that go to school are hungry . <p> Kids that are coming to school with no breakfast or lunch are getting zero support at home because they do n't have parents as we see parents should be , so you get a child at 11 in year 5 or 6 and their reading age is that if an 8 year old , so as you can imagine , they are embarrassed about what they do n't know , and they are mucking up in class . All they do is muck around because that is their defence mechanism , as soon as we go in there and they get access to all of our programs , so they get breakfast , have lunch , they get a reading mentor and a mentor that grows their self esteem and in three months their reading age jumps too and they are proud of what they know , they 're putting their hand up they are enthusiastic about learning . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is power . Education enables our young people to make their own decisions in life . I have met , and I 'm sure a lot of other people in not for profits have met , 30 year olds who have never ever been taught in their whole lives and they are unemployable and institutionalised because they know how to live on $100 a week . <p> So education is power , education is the opportunity to be what they want to be , it gives them an opportunity to break out of the poverty cycle , it gives young girls the opportunity to be somebody and not to be at the beck and call of a male . It is just so important . <p> What does a typical day for you entail as CEO of KickStart for Kids ? <p> I 'm still in the construction industry , obviously because not for profits do n't pay a real lot and I 've got a family I 've got to look after , but I generally get to work about 5.30am because we are a not for profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got four vans that go out delivering product to over 300 schools in South Australia . So we have to keep the product out of the cool rooms and the freezers , we 've got to load the vans , we 've got to make sure that the drivers are happy , make sure they know where they 're going , because all of our drivers are volunteers . We 're a volunteer-driven not for profit , our drivers come in every week and drive for four or five hours out of the goodness of their heart . <p> Then we need to source all of our product , so we go through about a ton of fruit every day , just for an example . So we source all of our product and we need to source that free of charge as well . <p> And then we have volunteers that go into all of those schools and run the breakfast program , so that takes a lot of coordinating . Our volunteers go in at about 8am and set up breakfast and make breakfast , and interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the breakfast programs they are the front line of neglected and abused children . If anything untoward is happening to a child then we see it first at the breakfast program so we have to make sure that all those kids are happy and they have come to school and that they are feeling good about themselves . And then they pack everything up and then they go off to work most of them . <p> Then we have to make sure our sandwich makers have made their 8,000 sandwiches for the week , we 've got to make sure that that is all going on . We do that in a kitchen that is donated to us at a hospital , we have about 40 people that make sandwiches every week . <p> Then we have a mentoring program and a program so those people go into the schools at different times of the day that suits them . <p> And then obviously as other people who run not for profits know , there is a lot of relationship building that goes on in order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have also just started a vacation camp called Camp Kickstart . So all of the kids that we look after , we can get them through school time but during the holiday time , no one knows what happens to them . They are at risk when they are at home and one of the only places they feel safe is when they are at school so we started Camp Kickstart where we go and look after the kids during the holidays , they are the real at risk kids , we make sure they have fun , we do some numeracy and literacy programs , because research shows at risk and disadvantaged kids during holiday time , their numeracy and literacy levels drop off alarmingly so we do a bit of that . We create a fun environment so they all have fun . At Christmas time we went out into the South Australian community and collected 3,000 Christmas presents for all of the kids that we look after around South Australia . So you know it is more than a breakfast program that we do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This year we are going into more remote parts of South Australia , we 've got a really good sponsor and we 're able to use his distribution system in getting fresh fruit and veg and food weekly to all of the really remote communities in South Australia . And then hopefully we 'll go national . A lot of our sponsors are national companies and they would like to see us going into the other major capital cities with them . <p> You have just been recognised in the General Division of the Order of Australia , how does it feel to be recognised for the work you are doing ? <p> Look , we do n't do it for that . I 'm a builder , I just saw something that just rocks my world and I had to do something about it , like lots of other people in Australia . This thing has grown into what it is and look , it is very humbling and it is probably very satisfying to my family because they have sacrificed a lot for what I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and associates , because I call on them all the time . But at the end of the day when you walk into where a child lives and you would n't even let your dog live the way these kids live , it does n't really mean a lot . <p> How do you find the time for you ? <p> I coach four footy sides and one netball side , I sit on the board of another not for profit , I 'm president of another sporting club side . <p> I had a grandfather who I was very , very close to and he said to me : " If you 're not helping somebody , they you might as well not be on this earth . " So our job is when you get older , I 'm 50 now , our job is to go out and help people and make people feel better about themselves . When I go and talk to people about volunteering I always say : " Volunteering is great because it makes you feel good volunteering , but it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What inspires you ? <p> Just seeing children live in conditions where they should n't be living in , and seeing how these beautiful kids where , through no fault of their own , they have to live the way that they live because of the circumstances that basically they have been born into . It 's not fair . Every child should be on a level playing field when they are growing up and it 's not the case . We have got to give these kids the opportunity . I 've seen some awful things that just rocks your world and you just have to do something about it . <p> Do you have a favourite saying ? <p> I always like to say that " education is power " . Whenever I go out and talk to people , education is power and education gives people the right to make their own choices in life . 
 <p> In some ways men and women are n't all that different , so , in what has been described as a world-first partnership , the National Breast Cancer and Movember foundations will together fund research to find single treatments for gender-specific cancers . <p> In some ways men and women are n't all that different , so , in what has been described as a world-first partnership , the National Breast Cancer and Movember foundations will together fund research to find single treatments for gender-specific cancers . <p> In an announcement on Monday , the foundations said they would provide a combined $2.5 million for up to two research projects focusing on breast and prostate cancers . <p> In contrast to the current tumour-specific approach , the grant will bring researchers of both diseases together with the aim of advancing new treatments and methods of care for prostate cancer in men , breast cancer in women and men , and , possibly , ovarian cancer in women . <p> Despite the differences between breast , prostate and ovarian cancers , there are many similarities in their genetic basis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three diseases . <p> The executive director of programs at Movember , Paul Villanti , told Pro Bono News the joint research had the potential to fast-track results . <p> " We see with common genetic mutations across different tumour types a really exciting opportunity to get answers faster in respect of not only prostate cancer , but obviously other tumour streams as well , " Villanti said . <p> " So the idea of partnering with leaders in the field in other cancer tumours really represents an exciting opportunity to get results faster for the people we all serve . <p> " Rather than doing it all in isolation , combining and leveraging our funds , certainly from Movember 's perspective , is going to get results faster than doing it alone . " <p> In Australia , prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men , and one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime . <p> Villanti said these statistics highlighted the importance of the unique partnership . <p> " This area of targeting common genetic mutations certainly has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think now is the time to double down and really accelerate breakthroughs , " he said . <p> " To our knowledge , certainly in terms of the quantum of funds that are invested , this is the first time prostate and breast cancer charities have come together to invest a large amount of money to achieve results that benefit both men and women . " <p> The foundations are hoping the three-year research grant results in new treatments for the cancers . <p> " Where both Movember and the National Breast Cancer Foundation play is in taking the earlier risks , the earlier research , and so there 's already quite a lot of promise being shown in preliminary data in a lot of projects that we have funded . <p> " We 're hoping that this effort builds on those results and really drives that knowledge forward faster towards clinical trials . " <p> The director of research investment at the National Breast Cancer Foundation , Dr Alessandra Muntoni , said the partnership would combine two extensive networks in the research community . 
 <h> Controversial Thriller Splits Audience Over Portrayal of DID <p> Mental health advocates are calling for an open conversation about Dissociative Identity Disorder in the wake of claims the new psychological thriller Split " stereotypes and sensationalises " those struggling with mental illness . <p> Mental health advocates are calling for an open conversation about Dissociative Identity Disorder in the wake of claims the new psychological thriller Split " stereotypes and sensationalises " those struggling with mental illness . <p> The latest film from M Night Shyamalan , the director of Sixth Sense , follows the story of Kevin , a man with DID formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder who kidnaps and terrorises three teenage girls . <p> The film , which was released in Australia on Thursday and stars James McAvoy , is proving to be a hit at the box office . <p> However Blue Knot Foundation , the leading national organisation supporting the Australian adults who are survivors of childhood trauma , claims the portrayal of the lead character , who has 24 different personalities , " adds to the stigma " attached with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disorder that really has been historically very misunderstood and very sensationalised , " Kezelman said . <p> " The truth is , DID is a serious and debilitating condition , and generally surfaces as a result of continual and severe childhood trauma , including child abuse and neglect . <p> " For the person experiencing it , self-loathing is a common feature , rather than sociopathic violence . People affected are no more likely to perpetrate violence than the general population . <p> " When you have a film that perpetuates myths about the risks of people with this diagnosis , which are not based in fact , it is stigmatising , it is re-traumatising and potentially very damaging to those affected . " <p> According to Blue Knot Foundation DID is experienced by 1 per cent to 3 per cent of the general population worldwide approximately 225 million people . <p> Recent research has found that symptoms do not necessarily lead to criminality . <p> " The reality of the disorder is that most individuals who live through it suffer greatly and require the right support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , understanding of DID has progressed to some extent , though it has not been rigorously researched compared to many other mental disorders . " <p> said dissociation was often a coping mechanism . <p> " It actually helps children compartmentalise aspects of their experience and their memory and keeps them out of consciousness so their psyche is n't overwhelmed , " she said . <p> " So we need to understand that mechanism and not see it as something that we should be scared of but see it as something that we should understand and work with and help to normalise . <p> " When I say normalise I mean , we all have parts of ourselves , but with DID those parts are far more distinct and separate from one another but that is actually terrifying quite often for the person who experiences it . <p> " When we have a society that perpetrates myths around violence and sociopathic behaviour as occurring in the population , which are not true , that feeds right into that fear . <p> " People are already struggling because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to take responsibility for promulgating stereotypes . <p> " Obviously they 're in this to entertain or to push the boundaries but with that comes the capacity to reach a very large number of people and you representing something which feeds right into myths and stereotypes , it just reinforces those stereotypes , " she said . <p> " It actually does quite a lot to counteract the progress we 've made as a community around understanding mental health issues . " <p> Kezelman called on audiences to take the film " on face value " . <p> " While there has been a lot more research into dissociative disorders of late , DID needs to be further understood and this film only perpetuates , rather than debunks the myths surrounding this disorder , " she said . <p> " It is meant for entertainment purposes only and Blue Knot Foundation urges the public to take this film at face value . <p> " It does not accurately depict what happens in real life and viewers need to distinguish the difference between a character in a movie with DID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Blue Knot Foundation is now calling for an open conversation with the Australian community about DID to " educate and enable a greater understanding and support for those living with the disorder " . <p> " What we need is a proper conversation in the community which educates the community about what is a significant mental health condition which ... is very common but it is grossly misunderstood , " Kezelman said . <p> " Years ago it was n't ok to talk about depression and we 've seen a shift in that and we 've seen much greater understanding and we need to see that sort of informed conversation happen around the impacts of childhood trauma . <p> " Certainly with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse we 've seen quite a change in the public discourse , so we 've seen often daily media reporting , we 've seen public testimony , so we are seeing some degree of understanding around the fact that childhood trauma has long term impacts and hopefully we 're starting to understand that this is not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " But regarding something like DID , I think we are a long way from a public conversation . Because anything that has been released on it and this film is part of that , has often been very fear based . " 
 <p> The proposed WA National Disability Insurance Scheme model could cost taxpayers millions and leave people with disability in Western Australia worse off , according to Labor . <p> In a joint statement , the shadow minister for families and social services Jenny Macklin and shadow minister for disability and carers Carol Brown have raised concerns over the cost of the proposed model , just days before the WA government is set to enter caretaker period . <p> The pair claim Productivity Commission estimates put administration costs at around 8 per cent of the total cost of the scheme , equivalent to $140 million in WA . <p> They called on Minister for Social Services Christian Porter and WA 's Minister for Disability Services Donna Faragher to " come clean " and say exactly how much extra it will cost for WA to administer its own scheme . <p> " In every other state and territory the Commonwealth Government is paying for the cost of administering the NDIS , " they said . <p> " But in Western Australia the Turnbull and Barnett governments want WA taxpayers to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macklin and Brown also accused Porter of refusing to release the evaluation of the two NDIS trials in WA which was supposed to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the different approaches . <p> " What is Christian Porter hiding ? He should release the evaluation immediately , " they said . <p> " Labor is very concerned that the proposed WA NDIS model could leave people with disability in Western Australia worse off . <p> " The last thing we want is to see is Western Australia end up with the worst disability scheme in Australia . " <p> They said " at a minimum " the Barnett government should agree to not sign any final agreement until after the 2017 Western Australian election . <p> However Porter has dismissed their comments and said an announcement on the agreement has not yet been made . <p> " The Commonwealth and WA both committed to 11 key elements that would provide the basis for negotiations toward a final bilateral agreement . <p> " The 11 conditions were stipulated by the Commonwealth and agreed to by the WA government . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as eligibility and access , the WA Government funding 100 per cent of the administration and operating costs , and clear sharing of governance responsibilities . " <p> Porter said the Commonwealth was still " working closely " with the WA government to negotiate a final agreement . <p> " Recognising that these negotiations are complex and it 's important to get them right including ensuring national consistency , " he said . <p> " Both governments remain committed to working toward transition commencing in July 2017 and an agreement being finalised soon . " <p> It comes after the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments announced in December they were negotiating a nationally consistent but state-run NDIS . <p> Speaking at the time Porter said it remained the Commonwealth 's " strong preference " for WA to join the NDIS on a similar basis to other states and territories but he acknowledged " WA 's firm commitment to a model that builds on WA 's existing disability service system " . <p> Faragher said in December the lives of people with a disability , their families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the NDIS . <p> " The Western Australian government is strongly committed to the NDIS and is clear that eligibility criteria , the provision of reasonable and necessary supports and , most importantly , choice and control for people with disability in WA will be the same as in all other states facilitating a fully portable national system , " Faragher said . <p> " We have a strong existing disability sector in Western Australia and we want to build on this with the delivery of a state-run NDIS which is nationally consistent . <p> " WA is vast and unique in geography and diversity and the NDIS we roll out here must meet the needs of all West Australians no matter where they live . " <p> The state-wide roll-out of the NDIS is due to commence in Western Australia from July 2017. 
 <p> Controversial founder of not-for-profit Street Swags and former Queensland Young Australian of the Year , Jean Madden is to face six new fraud charges . <p> North Brisbane detectives charged Madden on Monday with fraud offences following what they said was " a protracted investigation " . <p> It is alleged that between January 2015 and June 2016 Madden committed a number of fraud offences relating to her role as the former director of the award-winning Madden , from Upper Brookfield , has been charged with six counts of fraud , one count of falsifying a record and one count of attempted fraud . <p> Madden was named Queensland 's Young Australian of the Year in 2010 for her work setting up the charity , which provides swags to homeless people . <p> She has been issued with a notice to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on 28 February.In May 2016 , Madden , who started Street Swags in 2005 , resigned from her roles as managing director and director of the board , and the organisation voluntarily agreed to work with the charity regulator , the Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . <p> Street Swags entered into a voluntarily undertaking with the ACNC after its investigation found a lack of financial controls and conflict of interest policies . <p> The charity which provides lightweight and waterproof sleeping bags for the homeless , agreed to address these concerns . <p> Street Swags director Paul Daly said the board was pleased to work with the ACNC in meeting its governance requirements . <p> A voluntary undertaking is an agreement between the ACNC and a charity to implement a number of measures in order to comply with its obligations under the ACNC Act and Regulation . <p> " We have no concerns about it , in fact we welcome the ACNC 's involvement , " Daly told Pro Bono News at the time . <p> ACNC assistant commissioner David Locke said at the time that a voluntary undertaking was appropriate when a charity had fully cooperated with an ACNC investigation and had made obvious attempts to comply with their regulations . <p> " Where appropriate the ACNC works with charities to address concerns and to ensure charities understand and comply with their obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully cooperated with our investigation . By entering this voluntary undertaking , Street Swags has made a commitment to increased accountability and transparency within the charity . " <p> According to the voluntary undertaking , Street Swags has until 24 February to implement both financial controls and procedures for managing conflicts of interest , as well as produce a 12-month strategy . <p> Daly said he was " extremely confident " that the charity could meet the ACNC 's requirements . <p> Madden is also facing possible civil action over the handling of the charity 's money . Street Swags is required to provide the ACNC with any related court decisions or findings relating to the matter . 
 <p> The Victorian Women 's Benevolent Trust has opened its 2017 general grants program with a specific focus of supporting regional women and girls . <p> Community organisations contributing to social inclusion and addressing disadvantage for women and girls in rural and regional Victoria are invited to apply for grant funding from a pool of around $150,000 . <p> VWBT general manager , Carolyn Munckton said the trust would support projects that address the needs of refugee and migrant families or women or girls who are experiencing socio-economic disadvantage , lack of educational or training opportunities , or who live with a disability or illness . <p> " VWBT has previously funded many outstanding projects across regional Victoria including research and support services delivered by the Ballarat Centre Against Sexual Assault ( CASA ) , Wimmera Uniting Care 's capacity building program for women with disabilities and Gippsland Women 's Health Service 's program to support teachers and nurses working with family violence , " Munckton said . <p> " The rural and regional focus of the 2017 general grants round continues the trust 's proud tradition of targeting significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their communities . <p> " It 's vital that we are reaching out to rural and regional Victoria with our 2017 grants . Supporting initiatives that specifically respond to the needs of rural or regional women and girls will deliver positive , impactful outcomes for local communities . " <p> said VWBT did not specify funding amounts but asked organisations to " say what they really need " . <p> " We try to get into the nooks and crannies of needs that other funders are perhaps not getting to , " Munckton told Pro Bono News . <p> " Last year we supported organisations that applied for $2,000 as well as $30,000 . We encourage applicants to look at previous grants to see what was approved . " <p> said the VWBT was the grant-making entity of the Victorian Women 's Trust and over 31 years had funded nearly $7 million in grants for more than 560 projects in Victoria supporting women and girls . <p> Applications for the 2017 general grants close Friday 24 March 2017 .

 <h> Significant Uplift in Australian NGOs Use of Online Technology <p> New international research has revealed the use of online technology by Australian non-government organisations ( NGOs ) is on par , and in some cases , above average in global trends in what is being described as a surprising turnaround . <p> Significant Uplift in Australian NGOs Use of Online , 1st February 2017 at 9:28 am <p> New international research has revealed the use of online technology by Australian non-government organisations ( NGOs ) is on par , and in some cases , above average in global trends in what is being described as a surprising turnaround . <p> According to the research , 98 per cent of Australian NGOs now have a website compared to the global average of 92 per cent . Of those , 78 per cent are mobile-compatible in Australia , on a par with the global average . <p> Australia 's use of social media by organisations also ranks highly on the global scale . <p> A total of 92 per cent of NGOs in Australia have a Facebook page ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small NGOs have an average of 3,014 likes , medium NGOs have 17,328 and large NGOs have . <p> Australian technology support not-for-profit Infoxchange partnered with Nonprofit Tech for Good on the research . <p> CEO of Infoxchange David Spriggs said Australia was now rating above average on the use of online technology and social media from a global perspective . <p> " I guess I was very pleasantly surprised to see the significant uplift if you look at where we were even a year or two ago as a sector compared to where we are at now , " Spriggs told Pro Bono News . <p> " Things like a significant increase in the number of mobile phone compatible websites for example where Australia was lagging behind significantly , it is really pleasing to see that in this report nearly 78 per cent of Australian NGO websites are now mobile compatible . <p> " Really pleasing as well are the figures around the use of social media . So this is a significant shift forward . " <p> Spriggs said that the survey results showed that the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge now is more how organisations are allocating their time and how they responding to this , " he said . <p> " In the survey for example it said that 39 per cent of NGOs have a written social media strategy . I think that 's still far too low . It 's ahead of where we were , but only 7 per cent of organisations have a full-time or part-time social media manager . <p> " So it becomes absolutely critical for organisations to work out what are the most effective channels for them and how are they using those channels rather than taking that scatter-gun approach of ' we need to be on Facebook ' and ' we need to be on Twitter ' and ' we need to be on Instagram and LinkedIn ' and everything else and you only have two or three hours a week maybe of a staff member 's time to manage the channels . <p> " We really need to kind of reflect how do you make the most of those channels and how do you be most effective in communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wake up call for the sector around the importance of using online technology . <p> " Now it 's kind of how we can make the most of it and how we can be most effective . " <p> The report also looked at executive and board level interest in the use of online technology . <p> " The use of online technology to communicate with supporters and donors often sees a lot of organisations struggle to make that connection from the board and executive , " Spriggs said . <p> " And again it 's what are the channels that are most effective and how do you prioritise your time . Just because a board member said we should be on Twitter , it 's about working through whether that 's an effective channel and what it is actually bringing to the organisation . " <p> He said the statistics about the effectiveness of social media were really interesting . <p> " Ninety-four per cent are saying it 's effective for online brand awareness but only 55 per cent agree that it is effective for online fundraising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of channels including the traditional direct mail through to social media and email and that whole mix . I think it is important for organisations to think about that mix . <p> " Statistically 27 per cent have been using social media for two years or less so when you think about it it 's still a very new thing for organisations and how can we provide resources for organisation to really get a better understanding of it and how to be able to track the effectiveness of it . <p> " Only 3 per cent of NGOs have been using social media for 10 years . " <p> Spriggs said another interesting result was around text messaging . <p> " Text messaging is low in Australia as a way of communicating with donors and supporters , " he said . <p> " I think that 's comparable to other developed countries like North America for example . But looking at Asia and Africa where 31 per cent and 39 per cent are using mobile text messages I think that 's the importance for international NGOs to see the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's been a move to accept more donations by text messaging so it is interesting that only 20 per cent of those that send text messages which is already a small per cent can actually accept donations ... whereas that is 40 per cent globally . " <p> Infoxchange has been a long-time partner of Nonprofit Tech for Good a global organisation which delivers training and looking at the effectiveness of the use of online technology . <p> " We will be using the results to inform the capacity building programs that we run with the sector in particular the initiative and using that as an awareness piece with the sector and also to target some of our programs and particularly from those areas we have talked about about how organisations can be allocating their resources and how to make some of those decisions and acknowledging that this is still very new for organisations , " Spriggs said . 
 <h> Conference Looks to Improving Outcomes in Out of Home Care <p> The call for national reform to extend out-of-home care for young people beyond 18 is gaining momentum , according to Paul McDonald , the chair of NFP organisation Home Stretch , who will be a guest speaker at the the Improving Outcomes in Out of Home Care conference in Sydney in May . <p> Conference Looks to Improving Outcomes in Out of Home CareWednesday , 1st February 2017 at 4:36 pm <p> The call for national reform to extend out-of-home care for young people beyond 18 is gaining momentum , according to Paul McDonald , the chair of NFP organisation Home Stretch , who will be a guest speaker at the the Improving Outcomes in Out of Home Care conference in Sydney in May . <p> The conference will take place on 3 and 4 May at the Sydney Boulevard Hotel . Book by 10 February for early bird rates . <p> In this article Paul McDonald explores the argument for extending out-of-home care for young people until the age of 21 . <p> Australia is increasingly isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in foster care , kinship care or residential care turn 18 . Regardless of the young person 's current circumstance , the support they have received under Australian state care must end by their 18th birthday . <p> This includes young people with a disability , those still at school or unemployed , those suffering from depression or a physical illness , and those who are new parents . It is the age of the child , not their readiness to live independently , that determines when care is terminated in Australian child welfare systems . So , every year over 3,000 young people in Australia are shown the door from their care environment when they turn 18 . <p> Poorer outcomes than their peers <p> International research shows that these children , unprepared for life on their own , have higher rates of homelessness , crime and drug use , as well as poor health and educational outcomes compared to their peers living with families . Australian research shows that these young people lack the social , emotional and domestic skills needed to live independently . <p> Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are homeless , unemployed , in jail , or a new parent . <p> Swinburne University 's national study of 400 homeless young people surveyed in 2015 found that 63 per cent had recently been exited from care . <p> In contrast , most children living with families stay at home longer . They do not have the resources or skills to go it alone ; 50 per cent of Australians between the ages of 18 and 24 have never left the family home . <p> We must now reconcile this double standard when supporting young people in a family home and supporting young people coming out of our state care system . <p> Social and economic benefits <p> Until now , the argument for extending out-of-home care until age 21 has been mostly a moral one . But now it is a financial one . A landmark study by Deloitte Access Economic , commissioned by Anglicare Victoria , has shown that governments would save money by extending out-of-home care . Indeed , governments would double their money . <p> The chorus for reform has become irresistible . Extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate inquiry report into out-of-home care last year which highlighted that those leaving care are struggling to cope independently . It suggested that Australia should consider extended care options . <p> Internationally , governments have realised the great social and economic benefits if care continues past 18 years . As a result they have raised this cut off age and have benefited from a range of direct outcomes . In both the UK and the US , where care is extended to 21 , homelessness rates have halved and education participation rates have doubled for this cohort . <p> As found by the landmark Deloitte Access Economics report , if Australia extended care to 21 we would : <p> halve homelessness for this cohort <p> reduce arrests by 36 per cent <p> slash alcohol and drug dependence by 84 per cent <p> double the education participation rates <p> improve mental health . <p> It is difficult to think of any reasons why our politicians should not be acting and ensuring we see these young people through to adulthood . Every state and territory must provide the option for young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul McDonald is the Chair of Home Stretch a not-for-profit organisation campaigning for young people to stay in out-of-home care until the age of 21 . He will be speaking on ' Understanding the drive behind the Home Stretch Campaign ' at the Improving Outcomes in Out of Home Care conference in Sydney this May . <p> Register now for the Improving Outcomes in Out of Home Care conference in Sydney 3 and 4 May . 
 <h> Trumping the Politics of Fear a Critical Role for the NFP Sector <p> If we want to trump Trump , the charities and not-for-profit sector needs to be much more active and effective in telling its stories , writes David Crosbie , CEO of the Community Council for Australia in his first article for Pro Bono News for 2017 . <p> Trumping the Politics of Fear a Critical Role for the NFP , 2nd February 2017 at 8:10 am <p> If we want to trump Trump , the charities and not-for-profit sector needs to be much more active and effective in telling its stories , writes David Crosbie , CEO of the Community Council for Australia in his first article for Pro Bono News for 2017 . <p> Safety ranks second on Maslow 's hierarchy of human needs , only surpassed by the need for physiological survival food , water and sleep . Fear and safety are powerful drivers of human beliefs and behaviour . The politics of fear has always provided fertile grounds for those seeking political power . <p> Trump 's discriminatory approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans safe , even though the decree he has enacted will do the opposite . Most acts of terrorism in the US are committed by homegrown citizens who have been radicalised in one way or another . <p> The best defense against extremist Muslim radicalisation is support for the " moderates " those who actually follow the Muslim faith . Bringing people together makes us safer , driving people apart makes us less safe . None of this is contentious or even particularly hard to understand . Unfortunately , in the world where a reality TV star commands more respect than a Nobel Laureate , it is politically powerful to stand on a platform of fear and claim safety as justification for divisive policies . <p> If the safety of the American people was the strongest rationale for presidential decrees , US gun laws would have been changed many years ago . According to the peddlers of " alternative facts " , guns keep people safe in the US despite the non-alternative facts that in 2015 there were more than 50 school shootings and over 13,000 people killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic example , the politics of fear can have a subtler presentation . <p> Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is apparently " too soft " . In recent days he has effectively transferred youth detention management to the corrections system after a " mass breakout of young offenders " from Malmsbury Youth Detention Centre lead to a " shocking crime spree " of stolen cars and police chases . The latest incident follows a series of issues within youth detention centres that are apparently increasingly difficult to manage . <p> The Victorian government had already been reviewing police car chase laws and the current bail system . Both apparently " need a dramatic shift in the presumption of innocence " after a bail magistrate allowed someone to be released on bail who then committed the unthinkable Bourke Street carnage using his car to kill and maim innocent people . <p> Having taught in prisons and youth detention centres , spent many hours in courts supporting families facing very challenging life circumstances , and read a great deal of the literature on crime and effective prevention strategies , I struggle to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make Victorians safer . <p> In Victoria , across Australia and around the world there are many charities and not-for-profit organisations demonstrating the value of considered interventions to reduce crime and recidivism . Strengthening their role , investing more in their work , has clearly been shown to make us all safer . <p> Unfortunately , the success of many interventions and support programs in achieving greater safety is not what we read about in our newspapers or see in our news services . The work of many in the charities and not-for-profit sector building individual and community engagement and capacity goes largely unheralded . We seem more likely to focus on the need for targeted investment in addressing the tertiary end of crime policing , our courts , our prisons , our laws . <p> The best return on investments to making us all safer will come from spending more in the systems that do make a difference family support , early intervention , education , housing , health services ( especially mental health and drug treatment ) , employment , cultural and recreational engagement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the value of our sector , sharing the success stories , showing how we make a difference . As a sector , we have not been very good at promoting our achievements or effectively communicating what our success means in real terms , like reduced crime.This is one of the drivers behind the CCA Australia We Want report and the solutions forums we will be running this year . <p> As we enter the second month of what looks like being a very interesting year ahead , it would be good to see more people in our sector seizing the opportunities to promote the value of their work . This " self-promotion " advocacy is critical , not only because it validates our clients , our community , our work and our organisations , but also because it helps focus the public discourse on solutions rather than schisms . <p> The politics of fear will always be part of how power is gained and exerted in the world , but demonstrating how we can and do make our communities safer is a powerful mediator .

 <p> It 's Up to Us To Tackle , 2nd February 2017 at 8:23 am <p> A new campaign , Up to Us , is urging everyday Australians to stand up to the rise of Trump-like politics spreading across the globe . <p> Created by the Campaign for Australian Aid , the campaign 's first major goal is to influence the federal government 's foreign policy white paper its first since 2003 . <p> Announced late last year by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop , the strategic document will provide a framework for Australia 's international relations . <p> The white paper , likely to be released in the second half of 2017 , is open to public submissions , and Up to Us is calling on Australians to have their say . <p> " We think it 's a really exciting opportunity for the public to have some influence over the future direction of Australia 's foreign policy , " Campaign for Australian Aid director Tony Milne told Pro Bono News . <p> " People can stand up to and resist the kind of agenda not just of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <p> " We 're seeing it in the UK , we 've seen it on the rise here in Australia . It 's the politics of nationalism and isolation that we 're really challenging with this campaign . " <p> He said Australians could " absolutely " influence global politics through collective action . <p> " We 've seen large numbers of people come together around a common vision , and with common values they can make a real impact , " he said . <p> " We saw that with Make Poverty History back in 2004 and 2005 where lots of young people , a lot of concerned people , a lot of church organisations came together , and that resulted in the government making changes around its foreign policy and taking more of a leadership role . <p> " So we think the public is really powerful and they can have a powerful influence over the direction of the country and ultimately the government 's foreign affairs white paper should reflect the views of the public , and that 's why we 're encouraging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid itself has a long wish list for the foreign policy white paper . <p> " We 're definitely encouraging the public to have its say and put forward its views , but we want to see an Australia that is compassionate , " Milne said . <p> " An Australia that has an outward focus to its foreign policy and that is part of the global community in terms of tackling issues such as climate change , such as global poverty , such as the humanitarian crises that we 're seeing all over the world . <p> " And we think Australia has a really important role to play and we want to see Australia be a leading global citizen and working with other countries to address those joint challenges . " <p> Following the white paper public consultation period , he said Up to Us would call on contributors to continue the push for change . <p> " By putting forward a submission they 're indicating that they have an interest in being involved on an ongoing basis and we 're going to go back to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Milne said . <p> " So that might be engaging with their local members of parliament to talk about why these global issues are so important and the role that Australia can play within them . " <p> Collective action against Trump and Trump-like politics , organised by a coalition of advocacy groups , has already seen millions of people globally take to the streets to protest . <p> Milne said Campaign for Australian Aid would use a similar approach , working with other organisations to achieve greater impact . <p> " We 're already a coalition of over 50 aid and development organisations , and church and community groups , " he said . <p> " We 're reaching out beyond just the aid and development community to those involved in refugee issues , people seeking asylum , the climate change movement , and we 're saying let 's all cooperate together to advocate for Australia to be a good global citizen and to play a leading role around these collective challenges we face , challenges that do n't respect national boundaries .

 <p> There has been a lot of public discussion about Centrelink 's automated system of data matching and resultant debt collection . It may come as a surprise however that Centrelink is not required to comply with normal debt collection rules . <p> Before considering the current rules , it is worth reflecting on their evolution . The first coordinated Australian consumer protection law was the Trade Practices Act , 1974 . Section 60 of the act prohibited corporations from engaging in " physical force , undue harassment or coercion , in connection with the supply of goods or services , or in connection with the payment for goods or services by a consumer " . <p> There were similar prohibitions in most of the equivalent state-based fair trading acts . Unfortunately , for many years section 60 failed to produce any meaningful action in response to regular reports of aggressive , bizarre and sometimes violent collection processes . That changed in 1999 when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) launched a report and guidelines on undue harassment and coercion in debt collection . The guidelines followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors knew the regulator was interested in improving conduct and compliance . <p> Investigations and even some prosecutions followed . So did a more coordinated approach amongst the key consumer protection regulators . In October 2005 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) joined the ACCC as joint publishers of the debt collection guidelines . The joint publication removed any doubt that the approach to appropriate debt collection in the provision of consumer services would also be consistent across financial services and credit industries . <p> One of the case studies that deputy chair Louise Sylvan referred to at the October 2005 launch contained issues relevant to the current Centrelink debate . It involved a young man who received a letter of demand for unpaid video rental fees . The young man was unsure he owed the debt and asked for more information that the collector failed to provide . <p> Sylvan noted that collectors need to be very sure that the person they are contacting about the debt legitimately owes the amount , otherwise demands for payment could constitute misleading or deceptive conduct . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community 's interests for consumers to feel threatened into paying a debt that they are not sure that they owe and may in fact not owe . " <p> The law has evolved since 2005 . The Trade Practices Act has been replaced by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 . The modern equivalents of section 60 of the Trade Practices Act now appear in the Australian consumer law which is a schedule to the Competition and Consumer Act . The Commonwealth , states and territories share responsibilities for supervising compliance with the Australian consumer law . <p> The ACCC and ASIC have maintained and updated the debt collection guideline consistent with changes in the legal landscape . Its most recent iteration was released in February 2016 . The guideline is not law . Laws are made by Parliament and interpreted by courts . It is however a highly-evolved statement about the type of conduct creditors and collectors should observe if they wish to avoid breaking the law . This is what the regulators think the law means and how they will decide when to intervene . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It recommends , for example , accurate record keeping ( clause 10 ) , providing information when it is requested ( clause 11 ) and suspending collection activity if there is a genuine dispute about the existence of an alleged debt ( clause 13 ) . Many of the reports in recent weeks detailing Centrelink 's approach to chasing data matched debts suggest actions at odds with the debt collection guideline . <p> Centrelink is not however required to comply with the Australian consumer law and the debt collection guideline only applies to government bodies engaged in business activities . In other words , Centrelink is not bound by the rules that apply to every consumer creditor and collection body in Australia even the much maligned banks . <p> Centrelink could opt to be bound by incorporating the debt collection guidelines into its service standards or operating procedures . Other industry groups have been doing so for years . Again , the banks attract considerable criticism for poor conduct but have adopted compliance with the debt collection guideline as part of their Code of Banking Practice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended to require compliance for Centrelink and all government collection activities . <p> About the author : David Tennant is the chief executive officer of Goulburn Valley Family Care Inc located in Shepparton , Victoria . He is a former chairperson of the national peak body for financial counsellors , now known as Financial Counselling Australia . <h> 2 Comments <p> What you say seems truly extordinary . Is this why Centrelink and the minister are ignoring ever-growing storm of protests over the robo-debt issue ? Centrelink are not breaking the law because in this case they are actually " above the law " so to speak ? Where do the boundaries lie in respect to what they can do that nobody else can ? <p> So even though the system is throwing up huge numbers of perverse outcomes , punishing those not guilty of any wrongdoing the best we can hope for is that Centrelink are ultimately forced by whatever process to comply with the law as it applies to all other Australians in the future ? <p> Also , does this mean that no-one will ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are committing it , they are legally free to do so ? Retrospectivity will not be applied to them the way they are applying it to hundreds of thousands of others ? 
 <p> The distance rendered between the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) and education from its inception is symptomatic of the continued authority of the special education industry in Australia . <p> That the NDIS was founded at least in part on a common understanding that educational attainment for people with disabilities in Australia was ( and continues to be ) at a crisis point , is an unfortunate consequence of this authority . <p> Education is also the most used " mainstream " service among current NDIS participants . Instead of maximising these outcomes , however , the NDIS is framed in a way that develops a certain policy problem . <p> Despite the policy priority across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries of increasing lifelong learning opportunities , fragmented NDIS policy in Australia prevents people with disabilities from achieving this ideal . <p> Education and the NDIS <p> While equity in education is better served by progressive social and political theoretical bases than diagnostic categorisation , as with the NDIS , funded support in schools is tied to diagnosis . <p> This is similarly the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higher Education Disability Support Program provides funding to some institutions to offset the associated costs of providing access to students with disabilities . In the main , this program is not made available to providers of vocational education . In terms of accessing the NDIS , public services such as health , education , housing , transport and justice are considered " mainstream " , and though they are taken into account in the planning phase of an IFP ( individual financial plan ) , funded support is kept strictly separate . <p> In a document entitled Principles to Determine the Responsibility of the NDIS and Other Service Systems , the NDIA delineates what can be funded in an IFP for people in relation to their education , and the costs that are the responsibility of education systems . <p> These principles take into account the responsibility of the education system to provide all people , including those with disabilities , equitable access to curriculum , assessment and reporting , described as " educational attainment " that relates to " teaching , learning assistance and aids , school building modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsory schooling specific disability training is not offered to educational staff , there is scope to integrate this into funding in vocational and higher education . At the same time the NDIA commits the scheme to funding supports " not directly related to educational attainment " but rather to the impact of the person 's impairment on functional capacity , relating to personal care and transport . <p> There is a particular focus on resources . The principles establish any need for equipment and aids for a person 's education , such as assistive technology , modified textbooks and software as the responsibility of education systems , as well as collaboration with allied health professionals . The NDIS will , however , provide funding for both of these requirements away from formal education if they are deemed valuable for building capacity . <p> On the whole , these principles uphold the privileging of expert knowledge over the voiced explanations of service users about their needs in relation to their ambitions for educational attainment . Further , the disjointedness between the NDIS and education services to this end exacerbates the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the planning phase of NDIS participation . For one , education providers are kept from collaborative planning with potential participants , inherently because of the distance rendered between the scheme and education systems . <p> Even though packaged supports are created with families of school-aged children and participants seeking access to lifelong learning opportunities , this fragmentation ensures that a formalised and constructive pathway to enhance educational opportunities for students with disabilities remains , because educators are silenced , while participants are privileged only limited possibilities to speak . <p> What participants might ask for in planning is impacted , as they are steered away from asking for any provisions that might support their education . While it is unmistakably the responsibility of education systems to provide specialist training for school teachers as part of the funded support they receive from state and Commonwealth governments , it is uncertain in other circumstances whether or not training , resources and/or therapeutic support is the responsibility of either service . <p> By keeping them strictly separate a participant will be kept from receiving a coordinated programme that will incorporate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in relation to the detachment between health services and the NDIS for people with severe disabilities who require constant care . <p> Similarly , having identified young people with autism as the highest proportion of funded NDIS participants , it seems enigmatic that specific disability training for staff of compulsory educational settings in relation to students on the autism spectrum is not offered , but that it could be made available to further and higher education providers . <p> Teachers of compulsory education have expressed ambivalence over their confidence to adequately educate students on the autism spectrum in addition to other disabilities , pointing to the necessity to increase professional development opportunities . <p> While there is a call for greater funding to this end , the NDIS is absolved of responsibility in the compulsory sector . An irony persists , however , in that disability training is offered to further and higher education providers . However , the likelihood of students on the autism spectrum reaching this level of education is made improbable through inadequate support in the compulsory phase . Therefore , funding specific training in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to assistive technology , aids and physical resources such as books in braille , a challenge seems inevitable whereby equipment provided by the NDIS that could immediately benefit a student 's education will not be permitted for this use . Likewise , equipment provided by education jurisdictions will not be serviceable outside educational settings . <p> The restrictive consequences on a person 's education , owing to policy and liability concerns , will further regulate their access and participation in learning . <p> On the whole , that the NDIS makes this series of demarcations , while at the same time having been founded on principles of providing limitless access to services , particularly education , so as to leverage the social and economic inclusion of people with disabilities is indicative that the NDIS in its current form is inadequate to meet the multifaceted needs of people with disabilities . <p> It instead produces and exacerbates a policy problem wherein diagnostic categorisation , functional limitation and silencing of participants ' ambitions determine financially supported outcomes . Under this regime , formal education is rendered unnecessary for scheme participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . <p> Conclusion <p> The narrative of the nascent NDIS is that in its design it will leverage social participation of people with disabilities across Australia by providing for choice and control over life goals.This is unprecedented legislation whose comparable complexity has not been implemented elsewhere around the world . At the same time , however , access to funded support is contingent on medical assessment , economic rationalism and silencing , and any potential crossovers with mainstream services such as health , education , transport , justice or housing are instantly restricted . <p> In this way , the NDIS currently " mediates the dominance of the medical and neoliberal models of disability without necessarily challenging their legitimacy " . These competing discourses resonate with disability policy contexts elsewhere that limit inclusive capacity . <p> Entrenching this concern in relation to the NDIS specifically , is the limited choice available within the marketplace from which NDIS participants can purchase supports , itself further legitimising the supremacy of expertise in the life worlds of people with disabilities and silencing their agency . <p> The constituted subject of the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is still one of an impecunious , imprudent receiver of benevolent welfare . <p> The opportunity to develop a progressive disability system that will provide seamless access to appropriate services and support has unfortunately not been realised . The distance rendered between the NDIS and education from its inception is symptomatic of the continued authority of the special education industry in Australia . <p> That the NDIS was founded at least in part on a common understanding that educational attainment for people with disabilities in Australia was ( and continues to be ) at a crisis point , is an unfortunate consequence of this authority . <p> Education is also the most used " mainstream " service among current NDIS participants . Instead of maximising these outcomes , however , the NDIS is framed in a way that develops a certain policy problem . <p> Further , the problem is exacerbated ; increased participation represented by NDIS policy is not conceived broadly enough because access to lifelong learning opportunities are not made explicit in the policy platform . As a consequence of this framing , the NDIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicised extent . <p> About the authors : Dr Ben Whitburn , Professor Julianne Moss and Associate Professor Jo O'Mara are from the faculty of arts and education at Deakin University . 
 <p> Disability advocates welcomed the release of the long-awaited NDIS quality and safety framework , but expressed concern about the significant number of people outside the scheme who wo n't be protected . <p> The COAG Disability Reform Council , led by Social Services Minister Christian Porter , said the framework would be nationally consistent and would establish the responsibilities of National Disability Insurance Scheme providers . <p> " Worker screening and reducing restrictive practices are key components of the new framework , and responsibility for this will be shared between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments , " the council said in a statement . <p> " The Commonwealth will establish a national complaint and serious incidents system and an NDIS code of conduct for providers and their staff . <p> " The Commonwealth will also establish a national registrar responsible for registering providers and overseeing their compliance with registration requirements , including compliance with the national standards for disability services and mental health services . " <p> For NDIS participants , the council said the framework would provide access to information and support in dealing with providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be expected to deliver person-centred , quality services , as well as develop and maintain a trusted , competent and skilled workforce that reflects the values and principles of the NDIS , " the council said . <p> People with Disability Australia welcomed the release of the framework , in particular the registrar who will monitor overall performance of providers and introduce a risk-based worker screening tool , the commissioner who will respond to complaints and serious incidents and have powers to conduct own motion investigations of providers , and the senior practitioner who will progress national work to eliminate restrictive practices . <p> However , the organisation said it was concerned that the quality and safeguarding mechanisms appear to apply only to NDIS participants and providers " leaving a significant gap for those people with disability who are not NDIS participants but who experience violence , abuse , neglect and exploitation " . <p> PWDA advocacy project manager for violence prevention Dr Jess Cadwallader said the majority of people with disability were left out of the framework . <p> " Despite the fact there 's been some fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past few years , this is focused on the NDIS , " Cadwallader told Pro Bono News . <p> " The NDIS probably at full capacity will include about 10 per cent of people with disability , so we have some concerns about people who fall outside of services that are funded by the NDIS where the safety and quality in their service provision is going to come from . <p> " What we 've been calling for for a while now is ... a statute body that has a responsibility for investigating any and all occurrences of violence against people with disability . <p> " Some of the structures that are built into the framework are really great , but because they 're only limited to NDIS services , and in fact rely quite heavily on the structures of the NDIS to , for example , sanction providers that are doing the wrong thing , we have concerns that there 's not adequate protection for people with disability as a whole group . " <p> She said PWDA was also concerned about people on the scheme who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the registrar and the complaints commissioner have quite limited powers to respond to issues , including violence , that may arise in a situation where someone is self-managing , " she said . <p> " I understand there are some protections built in to who gets to self-manage , under what circumstances , but there is just a bit of ongoing concern that there may not be adequate sanctions for those who are using unregistered service providers . " <p> However , Cadwallader said putting " human rights front and centre " within the framework was a step in the right direction . <p> " That 's a very positive thing given that the NDIS is such a central part of Australia 's fulfillment of the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disability , " she said . <p> The states and territories will continue with their current , individual safeguarding practices until the framework is implemented . <p> The COAG Disability Reform Council said it would continue their consultation with key stakeholders , including people with disability , carers , providers , peak bodies as the framework is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supporters to respond to the government consultation processes throughout 2017. 
 <p> Charity peak body , Community Council for Australia ( CCA ) is mounting a campaign to name and shame ministers and senior bureaucrats that block the harmonisation of fundraising regulations in Australia . <p> CCA CEO David Crosbie said charities across Australia were frustrated with governments not acting to remove red tape and duplication that was costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year in lost productivity . <p> " Charities have had enough . Governments talk about cutting red tape , but when it comes to freeing up charities to do their work , responsible ministers fall into the arms of ill-informed bureaucratic advisers and wave more forms in our faces , " Crosbie said . <p> " Fundraising regulations are a classic example of feral bureaucracy . " <p> Crosbie told Pro Bono News there was now a majority of states and territories understanding the need to harmonise fundraising regulations and that they were willing to do it . <p> " It 's being blocked by really a handful of people , mostly senior officials , who just do n't think it 's an issue or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For us , that 's incredibly frustrating and annoying to get this close and find that a handful of people can stop thousands of staff in offices across charities all across Australia having to spend their time doing ridiculous red tape administration . <p> " There is no point to the current dog 's breakfast of regulations . They cost thousands of hours of staff time in wasted compliance activity . " <p> Crosbie said there was an easy fix if all governments agreed to work with the information already collected by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission rather than duplicating and collecting their own . <p> " For more than a decade governments have been saying they will fix it . Time is up . Please get out of our way and let us do our work , " he said . <p> Labor 's shadow minister for charities , Andrew Leigh , said : " Reducing reporting duplication would make a serious difference for small charities and local not-for-profit organisations like community centres and pre-schools , which often had few staff and resources . <p> " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist operators within this key area of social policy . " <p> He said the Turnbull government had failed to appoint a minister with specific responsibility for charities and not-for-profit organisations , and had continued Tony Abbott 's efforts to strip environmental organisations of their charitable status . <p> CCA is a signatory to the campaign along with over 150 Australian charities and professional bodies . <p> In September 2016 a coalition of peak bodies called on all Australian governments to provide charities and other NFPs with a nationally-consistent fundraising regime that will deliver more than $15 million in savings every year for charities alone . <p> The group said , currently , NFPs were forced to spend significant amounts of time and money to meet outdated and fragmented fundraising laws that differ considerably across Australia . <p> " Charities and other NFPs are wasting millions of dollars on outdated and unnecessary regulation funds that should be going to Australians in need , " the Australian Institute of Company Directors CEO , John Brogden , said . <p> " Across Australia 's seven different fundraising regimes , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each stage , from when and if a licence is needed , to how long a licence is valid , right through to what must be reported and when . <p> " This duplication and confusion means charities and NFPs are having to spend time and money on red tape rather than pursuing their missions . " <p> Justice Connect CEO Fiona McLeay said : " For smaller groups , it can be particularly difficult to navigate these complex laws . For larger ones , resources are redirected from service delivery to compliance , with spending on fundraising ' admin ' a significant deterrent to public giving . <p> " There is a simple way to provide a better regulatory framework for fundraising clarify and improve how it is covered by the Australian consumer law and repeal existing inconsistent and out-of-date state and territory legislation . " <p> Governance Institute of Australia CEO Steven Burrell said : " The motivation of NFPs to support as many people as possible often means they spend considerable time and effort raising funds from the public . <p> " However , the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barriers to innovation , and negatively impacts the sector 's sustainability and growth . " <p> make minor amendments to the Australian consumer law to ensure application of certain provisions to a broad conception of fundraising activities is clear <p> repeal state and territory-based fundraising laws <p> work with the sector and self-regulatory bodies to continue to improve fundraising conduct ( work is already underway to develop a single fundraising code ) . <p> Director of Justice Connect 's not-for-profit law , Sue Woodward said on Thursday : " It is a solution that could be put in place now . The recent interim report of the Australian Consumer Law review says the ACL already applies to most activities of not for profits , including fundraising . <p> " Governments need to act . Why wait ? As one charity told us : fundraising laws are just bizarre . Governments not doing anything to reduce this waste is just as bizarre . "

 <h> NFPs Welcome Ratification of Convention Against Torture Protocol <p> The not-for-profit sector has welcomed the federal government 's move to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture ( OPCAT ) describing the move as a positive and historic step in the campaign to end torture . <p> The not-for-profit sector has welcomed the federal government 's move to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture ( OPCAT ) describing the move as a positive and historic step in the campaign to end torture . <p> The Attorney-General Senator George Brandis announced on Thursday that the government would ratify the OPCAT which is designed to " strengthen the protection of persons deprived of their liberty against torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment " . <p> Law Council of Australia President Fiona McLeod said the council had long pressed for ratification , arguing that OPCAT would assist in preventing torture from occurring in any place of detention in Australia , as well as encouraging a culture of transparency and accountability . <p> " Ratification will build upon Australia 's history as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman and degrading treatment at home and abroad , " McLeod said . <p> " It will enhance the protection of the fundamental rights of people in detention in Australia and improve conditions in detention facilities where required . Independent and regular external scrutiny will provide an incentive for those running detention facilities to develop effective prevention strategies . <p> " Ratification of OPCAT provides an opportunity for Commonwealth , state and territory governments to work together to address long standing human rights concerns relating to the treatment of Indigenous Australians in custody , and conditions in youth and immigration detention facilities . Our concerns regarding the over representation of Indigenous people in jails and lock ups across Australia are well known . " <p> Internationally the OPCAT has been in force for over five years with 17 countries listed as signatories . <p> McLeod also said the federal government 's announcement was timely , with Australia campaigning for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for 2018 to 2020 . <p> International children 's agency UNICEF Australia also welcomed the move to ratify OPCAT . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of abuse , especially for children , who are particularly vulnerable . Liberty is a fundamental human right and depriving children of their liberty carries serious responsibilities , " UNICEF Australia 's director of policy , Nicole Breeze , said . <p> " Recent events at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre and similar reports involving other youth detention centres across Australia indicate that children have been subjected to extended periods of isolation and mechanical restraints . This is unacceptable and demonstrates a real need for improved practices through monitoring and accountability . <p> " The federal government 's commitment to ratify OPCAT is a significant and positive development . Preventative monitoring will ensure better protection for children who are held in places of detention . This development enhances Australia 's commitment to the UN Convention Against Torture which binds Australia to treat people humanely under international law . " <p> Breeze said the OPCAT requires the Australian government to establish a national preventative mechanism to monitor places of detention in Australia , as well as all relevant offshore locations such as immigration detention facilities or sites used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ombudsman will perform this role , " she said . <p> " The ratification of OPCAT will reinforce the important work of the National Children 's Commissioner , the Australian Human Rights Commission and others who have worked for ratification for some years . It also signals a commitment by the federal government and others to prevent abuse in detention facilities . UNICEF Australia looks forward to seeing increased protections for people in detention , including children . ' ' <p> Brandis said on Thursday that the government intended to ratify the OPCAT by December 2017 , following consultation with the states and territories on our proposed model for ratification and implementation . <p> " This will be an important reaffirmation of Australia 's deep commitment to preventing torture and other mistreatment in our places of detention , " Brandis said . <p> " OPCAT creates obligations regarding oversight of places of detention . These are intended to assist states to better protect people in detention from torture and mistreatment . The aim is not to shame ; it is not to engage in an act of moral vanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a tangible improvement to the treatment of people in detention . <p> " Ratification of OPCAT will see Australia establish and maintain what is known as a National Preventive Mechanism to prevent torture and mistreatment . In implementing OPCAT , our focus will be on what might be termed ' primary ' places of detention , such as prisons , juvenile detention , police cells and immigration facilities . Any environment in which the state deprives a person of his or her liberty poses unique challenges ; such challenges are perhaps at their most acute in such places . " <p> He said recent events had reminded Australia of the human , financial and other costs of mistreatment in detention . <p> " The government is of the view that ratification and effective implementation of OPCAT will encourage continuous improvement to inspection and conditions of detention .

 <p> Webinar Makes Workplaces Part of the Solution for Gender , 13th February 2017 at 8:47 am <p> Workplaces are being called on to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem when it comes to gender violence . <p> 1800RESPECT , the national sexual assault , domestic and family violence counselling service for people living in Australia , is set to host a webinar on Tuesday to help people better understand why gender-based violence is a workplace issue and how to respond . <p> The aim is to start a conversation about what people can do to ensure the health and safety of women , both within the workplace and their homes . <p> The webinar will be presented by The Full Stop Foundation , which was established by Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia . <p> " The whole concept around it is that in the first instance domestic violence will cost about $1.9 billion a year for employers so it is a great cost to our economy , " Willis said . <p> " Mostly that is in people needing to take leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids or just because they have spent the night before being yelled and abused and just really ca n't go to work today . <p> " And in the past what has happened is employers just decided that it was all too hard and it was the employee that was at fault and they got the sack , which of course even further reduces that employees options in terms of escaping . <p> " So employers nowadays are saying : ' We want to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem ... we have a valued employee going through a rough trot , if we give them a hand , we can assist them to safety and recovery and we will continue to have a valued employee . ' " <p> The webinar , Workplace Responses to Gender Based Violence , will cover : <p> trauma and other impacts of sexual assault and domestic violence <p> how a traumatised person may present in the workplace <p> skills in responding compassionately to a person who has experienced sexual assault and/or domestic or family violence <p> workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by perpetrators . <p> Willis said it was a question of having appropriate policies in the workplace and making sure the first responders were trained to know how they can support the person and how to develop a safety plan . <p> " What workplaces need to do in the first place is develop policies , around what they will do and how they will do it , " she said . <p> " Then they need to make sure that those who might be the first responders , so whether that 's the team leader or HR or whatever , is trained so that if someone comes to them and says : ' I 've experienced domestic violence , ' they know what to do . <p> " Now that is not about being a counsellor , but it is about knowing what the organisations policies are and also knowing the things to say and not to say , and also to think a bit about workplace safety planning . <p> " So it might be in discussion with the employee , that maybe there needs to be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what time they come to and from work , or another location where they can park their car or a desk at the back just incase the offender decides to come in the front door or a change of email because the offender is harassing them via email , so there can be a whole range . " <p> Under national employment standards , employers are now required to make flexible arrangements where an employee might be experiencing domestic violence , and many employers have included a range of different responses around domestic violence leave . <p> Willis said there had been a definite shift for employers to take the issue seriously and have processes in place . <p> " Ten years ago , this was n't even on the radar and workplaces would be saying : ' I do n't even see why we should be thinking about this , ' " she said . <p> " Now we get lots of requests from workplaces saying : ' Can you come and run the training and do things with us ? ' or : ' Can you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us some advice ? ' <p> " What we do know , over the years there have been incredible acts of kindness . I remember one woman I was working with a long time ago , awful violence and needed to do a runner and the boss showed up with a truck and half a dozen of his mates and loaded everything out of the house and in the truck and had another mate who had a flat that was for rent : ' There you are , you can stay there until you get organised ' and while they were unloading he recognised that the fridge was just about to die and next minute he 's back with a new fridge and set that up and gold . <p> " Human beings that you just want millions of them , can we clone you mate ! <p> " So there has always been people who do that but more and more now than ever , and having a formalised process in the workplace , this is part of the suite of services that employers offer our employees : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to be part of the solution , we do n't accept that domestic violence is acceptable in anyway shape or form and if we can do our bit in this workplace to help someone be safe from that , then we might not be able to change the big picture but we can do out bit here .

 <h> Public Support Grows for International Aid in the Face of Isolationism <p> Australian values of " a fair go " and equity for those " doing it tough " are standing strong in the face of a " global trend of eroding trust " , according to a new report which reveals public support for international aid is increasing . <p> Public Support Grows for International Aid in the Face of , 14th February 2017 at 8:39 am <p> Australian values of " a fair go " and equity for those " doing it tough " are standing strong in the face of a " global trend of eroding trust " , according to a new report which reveals public support for international aid is increasing . <p> The latest statistics from the Australian Council for International Development showed donations from Australian communities increased by 10 per cent , or $83 million , between 2014 and 2015 . <p> According to ACFID 's annual report 2015/16 around 1.6 million Australians ( up 7 per cent from 2014 ) donated a total of $921 million to 130 Australian aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time to international causes . <p> CEO Marc Purcell told Pro Bono News that while Donald Trump and the politics of isolation were " getting a lot of media " , this evidence pointed to " something else that is very strong in the Australian community " . <p> " Despite the global rhetoric of isolation , millions of Australians are not asking : ' What 's in it for me ? ' Instead , they are resolutely sticking by longstanding values of a fair go , equity for those ' doing it tough ' and generosity to help others , " Purcell said . <p> " The statistics show that Australians have the courage of their convictions . <p> " In the face of calls to withdraw from the world they continue to proudly support humanitarian and development aid to help people overseas and tackle the most pressing global challenges , like extreme poverty . <p> " I think the election of President Trump has really sent a shudder through the international system and people are worried about protectionism and isolationism , and we can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population is present in Australia as well , as America and England of course with Brexit . <p> " But what this information shows is that there is a very solid base of Australians that are engaged with organisations , connected and helping others in the world . And they are doing that because they believe it is important to assist others , to cooperate internationally on common challenges and problems , and demonstrate the Australian values ; that we are a country , an island , and we get on with others by doing the right thing by others in the world . " <p> According to the latest report support for small aid and development NGOs also grew , with overall funding more than doubling from $21 million to $53 million between 2014 and 2015 . <p> In the same period , Australian communities raised over $143 million to help nations through humanitarian emergencies such as tropical cyclone Pam and the catastrophic earthquake in Nepal . <p> On Tuesday , an analysis of community support for international aid and development across each federal parliamentary electorate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minister for international development and the pacific , Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells , will launch the electoral snapshots at a reception in Parliament . <p> Purcell said it was important to take the message to Parliament . <p> " From the prime minister 's electorate of Wentworth to the leader of the opposition 's electorate of Maribyrnong , community groups , churches , schools and businesses support NGOs working overseas , whether it 's through donations or giving their time to an issue they care about , " he said . <p> " Many Australians proudly uphold personal connections to another country through family or friends , or they are volunteers who have returned from overseas . <p> " These people-to-people connections help nurture enduring relationships between nations and act as a way to build international collaboration . <p> " We really want to take this message into our Parliament , to our politicians because I think they have been too inwards looking the last few years and they really need to recognise that there is a substantial base there in the Australian public that care about being engaged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to look more closely at their aid programs are as well . <p> " It would be good if our politicians showed a bit more support for the government 's own aid program , which has been a bit of a whipping boy with budget cuts over the last few years .

" <p> Since it was launched , Pollinate Energy has sold more than 18,000 products and has impacted the lives of more than 80,000 people . <p> Pollinate Energy Australian national manager Anna McGregor told Pro Bono News said the model was working well in Lucknow and the latest funding would benefit a lot of families in need . <p> " So we scouted Lucknow in July of last year and we launched in September ... and Lucknow 's been doing amazingly well , " McGregor said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that probably has n't had the kind of support that they need for particularly transient migrants . <p> " So people that we typically service in some communities have come from rural and regional areas to find work , so they are very poor , they are literally the poorest of the poor , and providing access to products such as our solar light and our solar fans , and water filters , are just critical for helping them to have a safe and healthy life while they 're sorting themselves out and finding work . <p> " Lucknow has been doing really , really well and we 've actually started to use Lucknow as a base , to start looking at other areas , close to Lucknow ... this funding is allowing us to expand out to those other regions . <p> " We 're finding that there are so many cities just outside Lucknow that are hugely unelectrified , so definitely families in need there that are certainly going to be benefitting from this funding . " <p> The partnership follows 12 months of discussions between Pollinate Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long 12 months " but definitely worthwhile " . <p> " They spent 12 months really , talking with us , meeting our Pollinators , visiting families , and really taking a thorough look at our strategy going forward and ensuring that their funds were going to be helping us grow in the way that we had sort of identified that we needed , " McGregor said . <p> " So it was a really long 12 months but definitely worthwhile and we 're very proud to have proven that . <p> " As a very small Australian social enterprise , it 's very exciting , it is a big deal and the support that they are providing is ongoing in terms of their resources and access is pretty great too . <p> " I think it is just going to be incredible for the people we are trying to help essentially . <p> " It means we can just continue to keep getting out there and working hard and keep getting to some other areas that perhaps we otherwise would n't have . " <p> The social enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucknow , sells products , the most needed of which is the solar light , to people living in makeshift urban slums . <p> People are then able to pay off their solar lights , which are environmentally friendly , reduce the harmful effects of kerosene and are significantly cheaper in the long term , over several weeks , having purchased them from a locally employed workforce of salespeople called " Pollinators " . <p> The model creates jobs for people from disadvantaged backgrounds , giving them the skills and tools to generate a sustainable income and a valuable role in supporting their local communities . <p> It also has an environmental impact , reducing the reliance on kerosene and lowering carbon dioxide emissions . <p> McGregor said it was an " incredible model " . <p> " It really never was meant to be what it is today , and I think that is the case for any business ... but we are providing employment for disadvantaged and vulnerable women and for people with disabilities as well as switching people 's need for kerosene to solar lamps and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't actually give them those lamps , " she said . <p> " So it is an incredible model . " <p> McGregor said the aim is for all of the cities to break even . <p> " We are currently seeking stage funding to grow our cities to reach break-even , " she said . <p> " It is quite a different model , so basically we are working towards our cities being sustainable and self-sufficient , and so that we wo n't need ongoing funding like this . <p> " Each new city takes 18 months to reach it 's own break-even point , so once it reaches that point , we are then able to reach a certain number of people with a certain number of Pollinators and then the income that those Pollinators generate through their sales can then help us move into that next new city and continue to grow . <p> " So by the end of 2017 , we aim to double our impact from 85,000 to 170,000 people with access to life changing products , so that essentially is really going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have . <p> " Our longer term goal is to be operating in 20 cities by 2020 and that will equate to a reach of over one million people , which is a huge milestone . And if we are reaching that many people the social enterprise will be sustainable . So it is very exciting . " <p> Ganesh Neelam , head of technology and innovations for Tata Trusts , said it was an exciting partnership . <p> " Given the strong connection between reduction of poverty and access to sustainable energy , Tata Trusts support and implement energy projects that are replicable and scalable , " Neelam said . <p> " Tata Trusts is excited to be working with Pollinate Energy , which continues to drive our mission of assisting communities to access the clean energy services that they deserve .

 <p> In the wake of a tumultuous 2016 , new opportunities for business to address social problems have emerged , writes social impact consultant Elise Harper . <p> In the throes of the major global shifts that 2016 delivered , 2017 dawned . <p> In its mere 365 days , 2016 brought instability across the spectrum : political , economic , social , cultural . We saw millions of people seek safety across the world as refugees , dividing ideology , rhetoric and response . We saw unexpected political outcomes from every corner of the globe send waves of shock and give voice to rising protectionism . We saw populist movements rise and rally , and leaders take bold stances in areas like climate change and cyber security . <p> While the challenges were certainly plenty , 2016 also saw a great awakening . More and more organisations have staked their role in solving global challenges : from tackling health and food challenges , to pursuing ambitious climate targets , to taking a role in changing narratives and behaviours in areas like social inclusion . <p> Organisations are becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collaborative in their approach . <p> For Australian organisations , these trends present major opportunities to define , activate and improve their social impact efforts in 2017 . <p> Use the SDGs to grow and thrive <p> " Sustainable business has the potential to unlock at least $12 trillion in new market value . " <p> The initial hoorah that launched the sustainable development goals ( SDGs ) in 2015 has calmed , and the movement has progressed from inspirational speeches to the need for consistent , coordinated , cross-sector effort and investment . So far , the goals have given the social sector a framework to refine and improve their work , and seen a small but notable group of companies such as Nestle , Unilever , Novo Nordisk and Maersk publicly align their core business or major initiatives with the SDGs . The response has been promising , but a mass of opportunity lies untouched . <p> This year presents huge opportunities for organisations to use the SDGs and its growing selection of associated tools such as the SDG Compass to guide their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining long term strategic plans around emerging and entrenched impact areas , increasing access for underserved communities and growing markets , and enhancing brand trust and transparency through shared purpose . <p> Empower employees as agents of change <p> For any organisation , employees are its first level of social impact , and have the potential to be its greatest advocates . Numerous studies have shown that employment contributes deeply to people 's sense of meaning , fulfilment and identity , above providing security and structure . Younger generations , in particular , are demanding work that aligns with their value systems , giving them broader social purpose , and involvement with causes and issues that they care about . <p> As the world outside of work seems increasingly out of their control , employees of all ages are hungry for opportunities to contribute to society , deeper than the yearly charity run . <p> In 2017 , organisations should harness the power , passion and skills of employees to deepen social impact and strengthen the organisation . The major opportunities are in building an employer brand around purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for community , environment or broader social impact initiatives that are deeply embedded in the organisational strategy . <p> Co-design things of value <p> Over the last 10 years , the search term " design thinking " has increased on Google by a huge 2,567 per cent . Beneath the buzz , there is tangible value for organisations of every structure and size . <p> In short , design thinking is a human-centered method for tackling complex problems . It focuses on the needs of the people who would be using the solution , not on those of the designer . <p> Over the last decade , design thinking has guided leading companies , like IBM , to create products and services that address consumer wants and needs intimately , and reduce inefficiencies and waste . The practice has also been embraced by governments across the world to design policies and services that effectively address social problems . <p> 2017 will continue to see design thinking solve problems big and small . For Australian organisations , the opportunity is ripe to design products and services that solve real problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reframe the business or social problems that need action now and in the future . <p> Collaborate to succeed and innovate <p> Collaboration across organisations is difficult . Fortunately , the last five years have seen new and updated models emerge that create value for companies and drive systemic change like collective impact and shared value . <p> When it comes to solving social problems , the imperative for collaboration is clear : real results and real impact simply ca n't be achieved alone . Social problems arise from , and persist because of , a complex combination of actions and omissions by players in all sectors . Therefore , they can be solved only by the coordinated efforts of those players , from businesses to government agencies , charitable organisations , and members of affected populations . <p> A home-grown example is that of NAB Care : a collaboration between NAB , Kildonan Uniting Care and Lifeline . NAB Care , an evolution of NAB 's collections department , helps vulnerable customers prevent and lift themselves out of financial hardship , reduces loan defaults and saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 , the collaboration opportunities for organisations are in building long-standing , cross-sector partnerships that link self-interest to shared interest and common purpose , to solve social problems that limit the success or growth of multiple organisations , or an entire sector . The opportunity is to foster mutually-beneficial innovation through the convergence of sectors and disciplines . <p> Report what 's relevant , creatively <p> In 2016 , we saw social impact , CSR and sustainability reporting take another step away from the old tokenistic nod to stakeholders , or expression of basic compliance . Increasingly , organisations are embracing storytelling , imagery , and digital and interactive experiences to bring their social impact to life , and create a genuine connection with employees , consumers and stakeholders alike . <p> A couple of notable offshore examples include Patagonia 's image-laden , high-energy report , and Heineken 's unique video with Dutch spoken word artist Kevin " Blaxtar " de Randamie , accompanied by an online game where users play through the brewer 's CSR commitments . <p> We predict that 2017 reporting will progress towards focusing more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This requires a more nuanced understanding of what 's genuinely important to people , and what metrics measure our evolving definition of progress and prosperity . <p> In 2017 , the major social impact reporting opportunities are in using innovative research methodologies to define what impacts are relevant to individual people and communities , connecting to relevant regional , state , national and international frameworks , and using digital experiences and data to tell individual and macro stories . <p> Conclusion <p> In 2017 , the opportunities to address new or ingrained social problems will continue to emerge across sectors and regions , and the tools and systems to support action will continue to strengthen and commoditise . The role of business in society will continue to evolve , presenting opportunities to achieve results that benefit shareholders and measurably strengthen the complex social and environmental ecosystem that enables growth . <p> For Australian organisations across all sectors , the path ahead is more innovative and collaborative than ever , and the best is yet to come . <p> About the author : Elise Harper is a senior consultant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy , communications and design agency based in Melbourne .

 <h> Investing in Our Future and the Role of New Capital Markets <p> If Australia wants impact investing to work better , the charity sector needs to be actively involved in the critical discussions , including the current government consultation process , writes Community Council for Australia CEO David Crosbie . <p> Investing in Our Future and the Role of New Capital MarketsThursday , 16th February 2017 at 8:08 am <p> If Australia wants impact investing to work better , the charity sector needs to be actively involved in the critical discussions , including the current government consultation process , writes Community Council for Australia CEO David Crosbie . <p> In many charities there is a delicate balancing act between investing in doing more and investing in the capacity to do better . <p> Imagine if there was a national charity infrastructure investment fund with hundreds of millions of dollars available on very low interest rates on appropriate terms for investment in improving the capacity of charities . <p> Imagine if this fund could be leveraged with in-kind and volunteer support , philanthropy and a level of government underwriting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me , provision of more dignified surroundings for clients of charity services is just one area of charity infrastructure I believe is ripe for impact investing . Too many services operate in run-down buildings with inadequate infrastructure . I also see potential in setting up a large scaled back office support capacity for hundreds of charities in areas where savings from scale and purchasing power could generate real return on investment . <p> There are many great examples of impact investing working to create better communities in Australia and around the world . The possibilities for new investments into the charities sector are increasing in so many ways . Whether we can and do take advantage is increasingly up to us . <p> The Australian government has been making positive noises about impact investing ever since the Financial Services Review suggested there was potential to better achieve some social outcomes if the impact investing market could become more active and effective . <p> Treasurer Scott Morrison has already highlighted the potential of impact investing to be used to alleviate some of the shortages in affordable housing and talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing in the UK . ( See ProBono News story last week ) . <p> The government 's recent discussion paper on impact investing very clearly sets out some of the issues with the state of the impact investing market in Australia . <p> The social impact investing market is only at an early stage , particularly in Australia . There are a number of challenges for the growth of the social impact investing market in Australia : <p> impact investments , especially at this nascent stage , are generally small scale , bespoke and illiquid ; <p> high due diligence costs for investors and intermediaries , due to the small scale of investment opportunities in Australia and the developing evidence base for social impact investments ; <p> the impact investment ecosystem is still developing : there are few mainstream advisers or wealth managers who are willing to provide advice on social impact investments ; <p> deals can have high transaction costs , often driven by the need to use specialist lawyers , finance professionals and intermediaries to establish the projects ; <p> a lack of accessible , high quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and payment ) for particular social impact investment projects ; <p> limited capacity in the community sector to deliver projects , with many organisations still grant-focused and lacking the resources for complex contract negotiation and robust outcomes-measurement ; <p> the narrow application of social impact investment : as discussed earlier , not all social problems could or should be targeted through social impact investment and it takes time to identify opportunities for social impact investing ; <p> the difficulty in clearly articulating and agreeing to social outcome measures ; and <p> the time frames involved in achieving and measuring outcomes may not satisfy investors . <p> Two main themes emerge here -- scale and measurement . Scale is an issue because if it costs $150,000 to set up a deal meeting costs , legal costs , business cases and appropriate expert advice then even a deal of $2 million has already lost 7.5 per cent before it starts so the investment needs to return over 13 per cent to be worth pursuing . <p> If the deal is for $200 million ( much bigger scale ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less than 0.1 per cent . Larger scale investments with lower returns become more feasible . <p> Measurement remains an issue if the benefit is about social outcome . Most of us are aware of the complexity of not just counting the economic outcomes ( employment , reduced hospital , justice or social security costs , etc. ) but also the ongoing impact on others -- family and communities . <p> On top of these issues , there are often hurdles such as effectively managing the higher level of risk and the challenges associated with equity and liquidity can I sell out or get my money out early if I need to ? <p> Impact investment is not the answer to all social problems and will not alleviate the need for government support of critical services . At the same time , there is a lot of good work already happening here . At the very least we need more capital in the charities and not-for-profit sector . <p> All this makes the Treasury discussion paper and consultation process on impact investing critical for most of us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discussion to ensure the outcomes of the review are not driven by a finance sector trying to get more profitable deals done or a government seeking to reduce costs . There is nothing wrong with doing deals or saving government costs , but the motivation needs to be around improving services and achieving better outcomes for our communities . <p> If we want impact investing to work better in Australia , the charities sector needs to be actively involved in the critical discussions , including the current government consultation process . <p> CCA is making a submission to the Treasury consultation process and welcomes all views from members and others on what the priorities for impact investing in Australia should be . <p> About the author : David Crosbie is CEO of the Community Council for Australia .

 <p> The Soft Bigotry of Low ExpectationsMonday , 20th February 2017 at 8:43 am <p> One of the biggest barriers to people with disability getting a job is the culture of low expectation , writes Kelly Vincent MLC from Dignity Party . <p> In Australia , 82 per cent of people without a disability are in the workforce , compared to only 53 per cent of those who have disabilities . <p> Unfortunately , an Australian survey shows that fewer people with disabilities are participating in the workforce than they were 20 years ago . <p> It feels at times as though we are slipping backwards . The statistics indicate that there are still significant barriers to people with disabilities getting a job and , importantly , getting a position that provides them with a living wage . <p> Some of those barriers are physical -- ramps , adjustable desks , screen readers and accessible toilets -- everyday , practical kind of things . Transport to and from work can also be a barrier to overcome . However , the bigger issue , and the one that ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face from potential employers and workmates . <p> It is safe to say that politically I do n't have much in common with George W. Bush , former president of the United States , but he used a phrase to describe institutional discrimination and bias that seems as apt today as when he spoke it , back in 2000 . He described it as the soft bigotry of low expectations . Even today in 2017 , it is a real thing and it is forming a barrier around people with disability every day and in all aspects of their lives . <p> When it comes to employment it seems that there exists this culture of low expectation , there is also fear , and there is a view that it is absolutely fine to pay someone with a disability $3 ( or less ) an hour when the rest of us are supported by laws that guarantee us a minimum wage . <p> Time and time again I hear about the resistance , ignorance and outright prejudice of employers when it comes to having a conversation around employing people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the South Australian public sector embarked on a special three-month long campaign aimed at increasing the number of people with disabilities employed by the government . You could see it on their website , they had a big push internally to find positions for people with disabilities . I can report that this campaign resulted in just eight new positions for people with disabilities . Now , with a public sector workforce in SA of 103,000 I know we can do better than that , and to do that we must become part of creating the inclusive future we want to see in the world . <p> It is important that we look at how to overcome the barriers to employment , especially the understanding the community has about people with disabilities . <p> We need to devise effective programs to increase the level of disability awareness and values training in the community . This needs to happen in schools and universities , in business and in government . It is preferable that this training be delivered by people with disabilities , as sharing our lived experience has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finding work that is meaningful makes such a difference to people 's overall health and wellbeing . It 's also important that we do n't seek short-term runs on the board in terms of placing people with disabilities in employment . It is not enough to have a job for the sake of having a job . We need to get individualised programs in place to properly prepare people for the job market , and raise their skill level , and their expectations . <p> In Australia we have an ageing community ; it is estimated that four in 10 workers will be aged 45 or over by 2020 . We know that disability increases with age , so clearly there are some significant workplace implications with this ageing workforce that will increasingly include more people with disabilities . <p> Australia is also facing skills shortages and , economically , our employers and service providers simply can not afford to ignore this substantial market segment of the community . The most significant barrier for people with disability , however , continues to be stereotypical assumptions and attitudes of employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is clear that people with disabilities must have equal work opportunities and equal pay when they perform work of equal value . <p> About the author : Kelly Vincent MLC is the youngest woman ever elected to an Australian parliament , the first elected on a disability rights platform and leader of the Dignity Party in the SA Legislative Council .

In their 100th year , they are awarding $2 million in grants of up to $10,000 each year for three years to deductible gift recipient ( DGR ) registered youth-focused organisations across Australia . <p> A recent grant recipient is SISTER2sister , a mentoring program for at-risk girls . Jessica Brown , the founder of the program , was teaching music at a South Western Sydney high school . Brown was extremely passionate about helping her students who were struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their potential due to challenging home lives and external factors such as abuse , neglect or were suffering trauma . In 2013 , She conceived the SISTER2sister program with the aim of addressing the core issues that come from the intergenerational continuation of poverty . <p> Today SISTER2sister is a year-long mentoring program . The little sisters are girls from disadvantaged backgrounds , aged from 12 to 18 years old . They are matched with a big sister who is a trained volunteer who acts as a mentor , role model , coach , and a friend to the little sister during the 12-month journey . The program kicks off with a weekend " butterfly camp " , that provides a safe place for the sisters to meet , bond , and build trust , launching a year-long structured program . With monthly workshops teaching life-skills , healthy eating , personal hygiene and sexual health , the program helps build their confidence while teaching the participants coping strategies . <p> The little sisters also receive professional help from doctors and psychologists to address mental health issues such as suicidal thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the year , the little sisters learn new skills and strategies to empower them to turn their lives around . The results of the program speak for themselves ; a long-term study of little sisters found that 82 per cent graduated school and are now undertaking further education or are employed . A truly amazing result . <p> Brown said : " The hardest thing about running SISTER2sister is knowing that there is a long list of girls in-need in areas of Australia where our services do not exist . Our program has a proven track record of long-term positive change and we wish we had the funds to service all areas where girls need us .

 <p> A new grants program will help not-for-profit organisations explore the " huge potential " of impact investment and attract investors . <p> The Impact Investment Ready initiative , launched Tuesday by Impact Investing Australia and Philanthropy Australia , will support not for profits with Discovery Grants , as well as for-purpose organisations with Growth Grants . <p> Philanthropy Australia 's Chris Wootton , who manages the Discovery Grant arm of the program , said impact investment was a significant opportunity for not-for-profit organisations to secure funding . <p> " It 's a much larger source of funds , it 's potentially 20 times what is available in grants . " <p> Impact investing is a growing field where investments are made into organisations and projects likely to produce positive social and environmental outcomes , along with a financial return . <p> It evolved in response to large and complex social challenges which can not be addressed or funded by government and philanthropy alone . <p> Grants of up to $50,000 will help not for profits prepare for impact investment . <p> " A lot of not for profits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wootton said . <p> " There 's a gap in terms of not for profits either being able to identify what makes a good impact investment proposal or in actual fact they do n't have the capacity either internally or at the board to develop such proposals . <p> " So the aim of the grants is to build capacity of a not for profit to better identify and/or develop impact investing ready proposals ... that 's the genesis of it . <p> " With the Discovery Grants ... they could engage a third-party intermediary , someone with that expertise to work with the board and senior management , to actually help them identify proposals . " <p> The first-round funding pool of $500,000 , with half supplied by NAB and half by funding partners , aims to support the sustainability of the sector . <p> " In order to address the social and environmental challenges facing Australia , we need a strong and vibrant not-for-profit sector with the capacity to develop and implement high-quality impact investing programs . The Discovery Grants aim to kick-start this process , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wootton said many not for profits did n't understand the potential of impact investment . <p> " There 's a whole range of ... opportunities in terms of businesses , in terms of services , in terms of other products or things that they do where they would normally apply to government for a grant , or apply to philanthropy for a grant , " he said . <p> " It opens up a whole new set of funding . We all talk about a not for profit having a good funding mix , so they 're not over reliant on government funds , or they 're not over reliant on philanthropic funds . <p> " But it 's on a different basis . It 's got to be where there 's an income stream of some kind or at least there 's got to be some sort of return for the investor ... and that return can be reduced , it can be a low-interest loan , it could be a zero-interest loan . " <p> He said the Discovery Grants were unlike anything offered in Australia , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a whole lot of accelerator programs , a lot of the accelerator programs have been picked up by individual entrepreneurs but not by staff within not for profits , " he said . <p> " We think not for profits have the size and scale to be doing this , but also ... the resources and the knowledge of what 's needed in society .

 <p> Optimism for Fundraising Future as Sector Moves to Clean Up Code of , 23rd February 2017 at 8:33 am <p> There has never been a more exciting time for fundraising , a conference has heard as the national peak body released the draft of a new code of conduct for the sector . <p> The 40th Annual FIA Conference , It 's Chemistry , got underway on the Gold Coast on Wednesday bringing together more than 700 delegates over three days and attracting international speakers including Derrick Feldmann and Alice Ferris . <p> Coinciding with the launch of the conference , the Fundraising Institute of Australia released an exposure draft of a revised fundraising code for the sector in a bid to reflect best practice and meet community expectations . <p> Speaking at the opening of the conference , FIA CEO Rob Edwards said he was optimistic about the future of fundraising , following a review undertaken by the organisation 's Substantiality Task Force , which identified a number of areas where fundraising practices could be improved . <p> " I have to say that I am more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time in the six years I 've been with FIA , " Edwards said . <p> " The reason for my optimism is simply this : thanks to the good work of our sustainability task force , that comprises senior fundraising leaders who will soon have a much better story to tell about how fundraising is conducted in this country . " <p> The latest review was triggered by a letter from Malcolm Turnbull , then communications minister , who expressed concern about the conduct of some fundraisers . <p> " What he was especially concerned about was their conduct towards vulnerable people , " Edwards said <p> " Now it is well over a year since I received that letter and the task force has been looking at issues like , are we over communicating with donors and prospects , are we respecting donors , what about people in vulnerable circumstances , are we showing care and compassion when we have one of those folk on the line and equally importantly , how can we make charity boards more aware of the issues of fundraising and how important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> " So what did the task force find ? Well , to be frank , they found room for improvement . " <p> Edwards said it was time to have a conversation about a new system of self-regulation . <p> " We have a draft code , and we want your feedback on the code itself , " he told delegates . <p> " But effective self-regulation is more than just words on a piece of paper , the solution for long-term donor support will come through better monitoring of the performance of your businesses and your operators , it involves compliance training for your staff . " <p> reduced in length by removing duplication and by using plain English drafting <p> new protections for people in vulnerable circumstances , including help to be removed from any contact lists <p> a new compliance framework involving " spot checks " and compulsory code training for all professional fundraisers . <p> He said it was a very important step for the sector . <p> " We 've all seen some negative media about fundraising over the past couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted and deliver a self regulatory regime for the sector that the sector can be proud of , but more importantly that the governments are very happy to support , " he said . <p> " It is about transparency , it is about being honest , it is about giving donors a choice , this code reflects those values . " <p> The announcement was made at the opening plenary session of the annual conference , which promised to build on previous years and offer a more eclectic mix of sessions . <p> Under the title , It 's Chemistry , the conference set out to put fundraising " under the microscope " and learn from the " experiments " of others . <p> Edwards said this year organisers had " approached it differently " . <p> " We have got some new ideas , " he said . <p> He was followed on stage by Achieve president and " millennial expert " Derrick Feldmann who gave the keynote address exploring the future of fundraising . <p> Feldmann changed the tone of the opening to explore the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why people do what they do " . <p> He said the key was in taking people " from belonging to believing to owning a movement " . <p> " Your job , constantly as fundraisers and marketers is to move people from belonging , to believing in the work that you do , " Feldmann said . <p> " It is so easy to attract attention today , it is so easy to get the kind of stuff that we think makes people believe in your work but I hate to tell you this but every time that we do the research around it , those people really do n't believe in you yet . <p> " That 's a fundraisers role , that 's what we 're here for , our job is to move people that have interests to action to deeper action for the incredible work that you do . " <p> He said it was important to remember that people believed in the issue , not in how an organisation is structured . <p> " Belief statements transcend age and gender and demographic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as a 75 year old , " he said . <p> " We need to start using statements that help us believe and attach to the work that you do , not because you are so well run , or because you have got the best board in the world and you have ended up in the black for the last 38 years , those things are wonderful attributes that the general population get excited about ... but the general population involved in a movement is just looking through you and looking to be a part of something . <p> " So we have to create messaging that we can believe in , and we have to lead with those . " <p> He ended with a list of eight key pieces of advice for fundraisers he had gleaned from his research into what makes a social movement leader : <p> get out of the office , be with people <p> talk about the issue , remove yourself <p> have an outcome , fight for something <p> ignore technology , get the message clear first <p> build believers <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there ) <p> make it about others . <p> " This is about the issue you address and the people that are so important that receive your services , they need you , they need you out there to connect the two together , because the vast majority of the population wo n't ever experience those people , " Feldmann said . 
 <h> Housing Affordability Watchlist for 2017 <p> When it comes to affordable housing Australia needs to triple its efforts to catch up to the growing need , writes Community Sector Banking CEO Andrew Cairns who offers his housing affordability watchlist for 2017 . <p> When it comes to affordable housing Australia needs to triple its efforts to catch up to the growing need , writes Community Sector Banking CEO Andrew Cairns who offers his housing affordability watchlist for 2017 . <p> We farewelled 2016 and recovered from the festive celebrations but now it 's time to consider what 2017 holds in store . <p> Here 's a 2017 housing affordability watchlist , where we expect to see the most momentum on this hot button issue from the key players , including government , not-for-profit organisations and financial services . <p> Increasing supply of affordable housing <p> Last year , reams of data made it clear that Australia needs far more affordable housing . As we prepared to ring in the New Year , a new survey was released that showed the biggest concern for young Australians is -- you guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most survey respondents believe it will take up to 20 years for them to be able to purchase their first property , while 12 per cent do n't feel they will ever be able to own their own home . It 's deeply concerning that so many young people believe they face a future of insecure housing . Thankfully , growing awareness of the size of the problem has resulted in a patchwork of action to increase the supply of affordable housing . For instance , last year we saw New South Wales councils setting targets for affordable housing in new developments . <p> I expect to see further action to increase the supply of affordable housing in 2017 , with more councils taking the initiative to set affordable housing targets for developments not only those in inner city areas , as reports show that the housing affordability crisis is spreading to regional areas , including the Central Coast of New South Wales , and will pressure local governments to act . We also expect to see more initiatives from private and not-for-profit players , such as the flatpacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be great to see innovative affordable housing projects flowing from New South Wales $1.1 billion affordable housing fund , yet it may be optimistic to predict much action on this front until the later half of the year at least . <p> Escalating need for aged care and disability housing <p> Rapidly rising demand is also expected to drive activity in aged care and disability housing in 2017 . An aging country , Australia currently has around 2,725 aged care facilities housing more than 160,000 elderly people . But demand for aged care accommodation is expected to balloon in coming years -- by 2050 , the percentage of Australians aged older than 85 years is projected to increase from just 2 per cent population to up to 9 per cent . <p> Meanwhile , the National Disability Insurance Scheme faces a major shortfall in disability housing , which 6 per cent of the 460,000 participants are estimated to require . Most of the specialised disability accommodation , which at least 27,000 people will need , has yet to be built . As such , we expect to see increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not-for-profit organisations will also increasingly collaborate with other players to innovate solutions and overcome the numerous challenges faced in developing aged and disability housing . A great example of this is the Summer Foundation , which has undertaken several demonstration housing projects for people with disabilities , in partnership with housing and finance providers . <p> New financing models to broaden affordable housing options <p> New financial models are key to solve our affordable housing crisis , which is why we watch initiatives to this end with excitement . It helps that we at Community Sector Banking are also involved in much behind the scenes work to foster and innovate such financial models . One key action area we will watch in 2017 concerns new rental financing models . <p> Last year state and federal treasurers unanimously supported recommendations from the Affordable Housing Working Group , which included a bond aggregator aimed at improving the supply of affordable housing for low income families . How will it work ? Simply put , bonds need less debt servicing , due to their fixed and long-term tenor . This will free up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to increase supply of new housing . <p> Most importantly , down the track it could provide more safe housing for the growing number of Australians being shut out of our increasingly unaffordable rental market . This year , we hope to see governments set to work on implementing the report 's recommendations and await the launch of the bond aggregator a potential game changer for the affordable rental market . <p> Beyond shelter -- social services shift to deliver a holistic response <p> Lastly , the days of affordable housing being about just shelter are over . Instead , we expect to see not-for-profit organisations and other social services players in this space increasingly shifting to adopt holistic responses . This means going beyond providing just shelter for clients to deliver crucial supports and services that improve their wellbeing , such as training linked to job opportunities . For instance , in Melbourne , social enterprise HoMie is running a 12-month Pathway Project , partially funded by a grant from Community Sector Banking , which will see young people experiencing homelessness trained as retail workers who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On . <p> The great thing about the start to a new year is the heightened enthusiasm , momentum and action that comes from considering a fresh slate with many possibilities ahead . After unwinding over the break , we 're ready to kick into higher gear . When it comes to affordable housing , we need to triple our efforts to catch up to the growing need . <p> About the author : Andrew Cairns is the CEO of Community Sector Banking .

 <p> Beyond a Strong Fundraising Code of , 24th February 2017 at 11:54 am <p> While a revised fundraising code of practice is welcome , the responsibility for any charter in this space is to be visionary and bold , writes Good2Give CEO Lisa Grinham . <p> This week we welcomed the Fundraising Institute of Australia 's revised fundraising code for the charity and not-for-profit sector . The exposure draft addresses key public grievances towards fundraising practices of late . Namely how we approach people in vulnerable circumstances and the due diligence charities carry out when working with fundraising contractors . <p> These are important steps firstly because it 's the right thing to do . But also because it helps to avoid future scandal , something that as a sector we frankly ca n't afford . Preserving trust is indeed important , but will it equate with donations to the tune of billions ? I doubt it . <p> If we are going to effectively fund organisations to meet growing community demand in the coming years , there is a responsibility for any charter in this space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo , and focused on innovating and improving fundraising to engage donors in new and meaningful ways . <p> So why is this code needed ? As Rob Edwards , CEO at the Fundraising Institute of Australia , highlighted at the recent FIA Conference , over a year ago there was a direct call from the then federal communications minister to curb unethical behaviour directed at vulnerable people . And last year a number of third-party companies conducting traditional fundraising were drawn into the spotlight . Not for their invasive techniques though you would n't have to travel far to find someone to complain about that but for mistreating employees . Reports of bullying and underpayment made national headlines . It 's not the first time that some third-party fundraisers have been hit by undesirable attention . Theirs is a reputation stained by an array of criticism from for door knocking , phone calling or on-street fundraising . <p> The complaints have been from the media , mayors , politicians and the regular uproar from a hijacked pedestrian who just lost their coffee to a forceful handshake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shamed as a result , and you might say that 's fair enough , but the wider sector suffers as a result . It 's reputation damage that we ca n't afford . It 's funding that those charities ' beneficiaries certainly ca n't afford . <p> So , with such high risk and possible brand damage , why do we continue to see charities invest in these practices ? And importantly , why are n't we actively driving towards smarter ways of raising funds ? It 's pretty simple : traditional fundraising methods work . And have done so for decades . But you know what else works ? Change . <p> It 's about the money , right ? <p> Australia 's largest study of charitable giving in over 10 years found that while 64 per cent of people dislike being approached by street fundraisers , close to 20 per cent still made a donation to them . That figure went up to 25 per cent when approached through a phone call , and 57 per cent when met at the own home by a door knocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached 50,000 people every day through face-to-face fundraising . An effort that raised $800 million for key Australian charities in 2016 . Even with the potential of losing up to 60 per cent of donations to the fundraising company it 's a service that still manages to make its case . These fundraising methods are a valuable source of income for many critical services and programs . Those services come with a price tag , and the money has to come from somewhere . And increasingly that 's not going to be government . <p> So let 's find a new way to give <p> Please . It 's time . We 're already hearing noises that 2017 will be a hard year when it comes to raising funds , but it is the year 2017 and there are plenty of emerging technology solutions and fundraising initiatives that can shift the sector out of the era of shaking a tin . It 's not just digital innovation for hipster cred , it 's where our community operates . And it 's just a smarter way to raise funds -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of my favourites . <p> Vodafone last year had customers donate their phone data for the Garvan Institute big-data research . Woolworth 's latest initiative to add a donation to your shopping basket online or in their store . And Share the Dignity 's handbag drive has taken off not just in my office . My colleague 's Facebook feed was flooded with pictures from friends . <p> There are smarter ways to give through simple text messaging , and NAB 's latest rewards program that we recently partnered with , that enables credit card holders the opportunity to donate points to their charity of choice . We 're seeing groups like The Funding Network take off , and there 's Good2Give . <p> We have 20 per cent of the top ASX 100 companies offering their staff our online Workplace Giving Platform . Across a client base of more than 100 companies , 70 per cent match their employees ' donations and effectively double the charitable impact . That 's before mentioning the ridiculously low admin fees and fundraising costs to the charity who last financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> Let 's be real though -- even though we 're a not-for-profit organisation we do charge modest fees so we can turn the lights on and pay our amazing staff . It 's through the generosity of the companies we work with who pay the majority of our fees that we can then deliver such low-cost funding to charities across Australia and NZ . Perhaps at Good2Give we think about things a little differently . We are all about how people like to give and making it easy for them to do so . That means bringing charitable engagement into their lives in ways that resonates and has meaning to them . <p> Putting the " fun " back in fundraising <p> Fundraising should not be a dirty word . Nor should it be an outdated one . The act of raising funds for a good cause is synonymous with words like : generosity , contributing and supporting . Why should that be anything but positive ? Community giving initiatives should bring us together and make us proud as a society that when one of us falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we spend on carrying the guilt of poor practice in fundraising and harnessing the generosity of Australians with traditional methods , let 's invest in new approaches , utilise and adapt evolving technology and consider what other smart systems people are already using in their everyday lives to make it easy , to make it resonate . <p> A shared code that we uphold as a sector collectively is one thing . The incredible transparency we gain from existing regulation is another . And while these lie important foundations , they should n't be offering a level of complacency in preserving how we 've once raised funds and how we continue to do so moving forward . In sum , they 're not an excuse to press set and forget . We need to do more as a sector to actively invest in methods of giving that represent charities as a movement for excellence , for positive change . <p> We frankly need to stop irritating supporters because the negative sentiment is there and it can not be ignored . So let 's provide and invest in giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supporters who manage their lives digitally , do n't sign up for anything on the street and often do n't have a landline available to their rental property . <p> It 's only then that we 'll tap into the generosity that exists in Australia and will bring the communities who we serve along for the journey . <p> About the author : Lisa Grinham is the CEO of Good2Give , a not-for-profit organisations that works with companies to encourage corporate philanthropy. 
 <p> Social Impact : The Use of Language and Why It , 1st March 2017 at 8:05 am <p> As language is increasingly used to obscure truth , Alan Kay , coordinator of the UK 's Social Audit Network , explains why the meaning of social impact is also at risk . <p> In this world of a Trump presidency in the USA and Brexit in the UK where facts and " truth " are being stretched to a frightening degree , I am reminded of George Orwell and his concept of doublethink . In 1984 he writes : <p> War is peace . Freedom is slavery . Ignorance is strength . The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world . Lies will pass into history . <p> This idea of words and language being used to manipulate thinking is at the heart of Orwell 's work . He recognised that language and words are crucially important . <p> As we enter a world of post-truth and increasingly instantaneous information and communication , we are going to have to be more scrupulous in filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been designed to influence the way we think . <p> Of course , language can be used to explain and clarify things . The late James Cameron in an article in the Guardian in the 1980s wrote about how he did not really know or understand his opinion on things until he had tried to express it in words . He relates how he became surprised at the opinions often strong opinions that he held which only really come to light when he put his thoughts into words . <p> This resonated with me at that time and it still does -- as it reveals the strong link between our culture the way we think about things in the world , and the language we use to explain it to ourselves and to others . <p> But language can also be used to confuse and obfuscate the truth intended in the meaning . <p> Often there is a difference between what people say they are doing and what they are actually doing . This lack of a clear link with reality may just be the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulate how others think about things and what they do about it . <p> In the world of social enterprise , words are used in ways that intend to influence . Indeed , the term social enterprise originated from the French , economie sociale , and its early use was not to explain economic activity in " social " ways or in benefitting people . Rather the term was used to explain that the economic activity was ownedby people . For me this is an interesting distinction , and one that is often forgotten . But , of course , the term has evolved from its roots into what we understand social enterprise to mean today , that is , the impacton people . <p> Another example from the history of social enterprise ... <p> A precursor to social enterprise in the UK was the Scottish community business movement that started in the 1970s with rural community co-operatives supported by the then Highlands and Islands Development Board ( now Highland and Islands Enterprise ) . <p> The idea of community ownership of economic activity spread to urban areas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This movement flourished , became established and mainstream . In the early 1990s it came in for a lot of criticism ( some of it quite valid ) but this led to people changing the terminology if not the concept . They started to refer to these types of organisations as " community enterprises " . Not the old guard , " community business " , but the fresh and new , " community enterprise " ' . <p> Similarly , in the early 1990s a range of versions of community-owned businesses emerged . In my view , they were more or less the same thing but with a new twist : " development trusts " , " social firms " -- to name but two . Old wine in new bottles . The newly formed terms new concept . <p> Turning to the world of " social impact " there are similar things happening . <p> I have been actively involved in social accounting and audit for many years . We started to use this term in the early 2000s replacing " social audit " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of social accounting and social audit . As you can imagine it is not a particularly popular term and we thought of changing it into something more immediately appealing like , SEE Visioning or similar . <p> It was thought that a change of name might attract those that associated accounting and audit with arduous and stressful connotations . For better or for worse we stuck with the accuracy of social accounting and audit . You get what is says on the tin . <p> More recently I have become aware of a subtle change of word usage in the social impact field . <p> A few years ago , the term impact measurement was on everyone 's lips . We were being encouraged to " measure " the change that happens on people , the environment and on the local economies . If we could not , the argument was that the impact could not be managed -- or so we were told . <p> The Social Audit Network has always disputed this and said that just because one can not measure something , one can still put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that most people personally would value in their lives , can not be measured like love , close friendship , the warmth of company , the delight in a beautiful view , the exhilaration of achievement , and so on . Others in this area of social impact insisted that measurement was key . <p> Inevitably , those who insisted on measuring things and often reducing the good things in life to a financial value are now recognising that they may have been wrong . But instead of accepting that yes , you are right they change the words . " Impact management " has been introduced . Recognising the absurdities of trying to measuring everything , which one can not sensibly do , let 's change it to managingand understanding our impact . <p> Perhaps what is not so strange is that those advocating impact management now are not a million miles away from what social accounting and audit has been suggesting for decades . <p> So the use of language may just be a minor skirmish within the social impact . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the way we use language and what we really mean . <p> I can see that in a future more nationalist , more fearful , more defensive and exclusive world , the connection between language and " truth " will become more divergent . <p> The writing of Orwell will no doubt come back to haunt ( or is it taunt us ? ) . In his work , Politics and the English Language declared aims , one turns , as it were , instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms , like a cuttlefish squirting out ink . <p> I am not sure what a cuttlefish is , but there seems to be a lot of them about . <p> About the author : Alan Kay is a founding board member of the UK 's Social Audit Network a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates the exchange of information and experience between practitioners of social accounting and audit in the social economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience in community development and social enterprise support in the UK and overseas . He co-authored the 2005 Social Accounting and Audit Manuals and more recently wrote the New Guide to Social Accounting and Audit . 
 <p> The aim of the program is to invest in South Australian based not-for-profit organisations ( or those delivering programs in South Australia ) that are building organisational capacity and effectiveness . <p> AET said funding would be provided to eligible not-for-profit organisations that demonstrate leadership through adapting their organisation and revenue models , developing capability in their staff , volunteers or partners through professional learning opportunities , and developing new and innovative programs . <p> The AET Discretionary Grants Program has two underlying programs : <p> The AET Learning for Impact Program which supports organisations that recognise and value the role talented staff play in delivering outcomes for their organisation and the communities they serve . <p> The AET Small to Medium Investment Program which aims to provide untied investment for South Australian based organisations that are considered small to medium in size ( approximately $5 million or less in annual turnover ) . <p> The program forms part of the nearly $6 million AET will distribute to Australian charities in 2017 as manager of over 100 charitable trusts . <p> AET head of philanthropy Ben Clark said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are excited by the opportunities this will provide through building organisational capacity in not-for-profit organisations . <p> " This year 's program demonstrates our continued commitment to funding South Australian programs and recognises the needs and critical role of small-to-medium not-for-profit organisations . " <p> The funding round for the program opened 27 February and will close 1 May 2017 . Successful applicants will be notified by 30 May 2017 with funding agreements expected to be finalised before 30 June 2017. 
 <h> The Tipping Point ? <p> The charities sector has experienced unprecedented growth over the last decade , but there is increasing evidence that the trend upwards is at best levelling out and at worst starting to head down , writes CEO of Community Council for Australia , David Crosbie . <p> The charities sector has experienced unprecedented growth over the last decade , but there is increasing evidence that the trend upwards is at best levelling out and at worst starting to head down , writes CEO of Community Council for Australia , David Crosbie . <p> The findings released by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission ( ACNC ) and the Centre for Social Impact ( CSI ) over the past month about the charities sector make for interesting reading . Total income across the charities sector has grown from $122 billion to $134 billion -- an increase of 10 per cent . Similarly , staff numbers are reported to have increased from 1.1 million to 1.2 million . These increases continue a pattern stretching back a decade . <p> In 2007 total turnover was estimated to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector has been increasing at over 10 per cent every year for a decade . Employment levels in 2007 were around 700,000 . <p> Based on these figures you might assume everything is going gangbusters across the charities sector . This kind of growth means the charities sector is clearly outperforming any industry group in Australia . But these assumptions may well be wrong . The reality is a little more complex and the story not so positive for the whole sector . <p> ACNC and CSI conducted their own internal comparison of 30,000 charities where they had relatively good comparative financial data between the 2014 and 2015 financial years . What it revealed is that most charities are not experiencing any increase in their income , and this is especially true for smaller charities . In fact , on average across all the 30,000 charities in the comparison , total income rose by less than 2 per cent below the annual rise in the CPI which amounts to a real reduction in income . <p> Professor Myles McGregor Lowndes from QUT has spent a professional lifetime analysing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle " to describe the process where a charity repeatedly cuts back on administration and infrastructure when money gets tight to try to protect their services and activities . When I talk with many of the smaller charities from different segments of the sector , and in different parts of Australia , it seems to me that the starvation cycle is being applied . <p> There are also some indications from more in-depth research into segments of the Australian charities sector that the level of reserves held by charities is slowly being depleted . <p> Most would agree that in recent years , growth in government funded programs has stalled , philanthropy and giving are not increasing in the same way they were before the GFC , and income from fees and services is increasingly contested . The drivers of charity growth appear to be levelling out . When you combine this lack of growth in income streams with a significant increase in competition within the charities sector for all sources of funding , and the growing encroachment of for-profits into areas previously largely dominated by charities , the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most charities . <p> The Charities Aid Foundation in the United Kingdom recently published a new report , The Social Landscape 2017 , the largest survey of UK charity chief executives . Key findings indicate that the UK charities sector is facing some very real and immediate challenges : <p> The biggest challenges identified by charity leaders in the coming year are generating more income and achieving financial sustainability , meeting demand for services and a reduction in public and government funding . <p> Almost one in five fear their organisation is struggling to survive , rising to more than one in four among charities with an annual income less than ? 1 million ( million ) . <p> More than a third had to dip into their reserves last year to cover income shortfalls . <p> Three in five say they either have restructured in the past 12 months or will be doing so in the next 12 months . <p> One in three has reduced or is set to reduce staff numbers and downsize the organisation over the same period . <p> More than a quarter say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares to 19 per cent who said this was a case when the same research was carried out in 2015 . <p> It is difficult to say with any authority that the Australian sector is in a similar position . We do not have the same data . But for the first time , with the potential to look more closely at the details in the ACNC data , we are starting to see beyond the headline figures and the story is not quite what the headlines might suggest . <p> Perhaps part of the explanation lies in an apparent significant increase in the size of the education and research segment of our sector ( now $60 billion annual turnover ) and the fact that less than 60 organisations in this area now have a combined total annual income of over $34 billion . I am sure more informative findings will emerge as the CSI researchers begin interrogating the ACNC data in greater depth . <p> At Community Council for Australia , we are concerned about the trends across the broader charities sector . It is hard to sustain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . There are many charities performing very well , increasing their effectiveness and capacity , growing their income and their impact . At the same time , the trend , at least for smaller organisations , appears to be more negative than positive . <p> The charities sector has experienced unprecedented growth over the last decade , but there is increasing evidence that for most charities , the trend upwards is at best levelling out , and at worst , starting to head down . <p> Maybe we are at the tipping point ? <p> About the author : David Crosbie is CEO of the Community Council for Australia .

 <p> The contentious issue of not-for-profit board remuneration caused a heated debate at the Australian Governance Summit on Thursday . <p> The not-for-profit director session , called Profit is Not a Dirty Word , began with an opening address from the head of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission , Susan Pascoe AM . <p> While the focus of the panel was financial sustainability , it was a question from the audience that divided the panelists , philanthropists and international directors Allan Myers AC and Laura Anderson , and independent journalist Gideon Haigh . <p> " One of the big pieces of dialogue I 've experienced in my role in a not for profit is : ' Do we pay directors ? ' " the questioner said . <p> " You could be glib and say : ' You pay for what you get sometimes , ' and ... my feeling 's always been we should n't be adverse to paying directors -- prioritise that a bit more highly and not be as pious sometimes about why people come to the boards of not for profits . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found almost 14 per cent of not-for-profit board members were currently receiving payment for their services a drop from a 17 per cent high in 2012/13 . <p> The authors of the report said respondents were passionate in their responses to the topic . <p> On the panel , Myers , who founded the Grattan Institute and chairs the National Gallery of Australia Council , led the debate , strongly opposing board remuneration . <p> " I 'm on the other side of the debate , let me say that right at the beginning ... Do you think you 're going to get better people by paying them , that 's the first question , " Myers said . <p> " What 's the evidence that you 'll get better people by paying them ? There are plenty of people in our society who have the time and the energy and , if you like , the financial background , they 're in a comfortable financial position to serve on boards . <p> " At least you 're sure if someone comes onto a board , if he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for something other than the money . " <p> Myers , who was valued at $671 million in last year 's BRW Rich List , said " strong and vibrant " voluntary support of charitable causes was a hallmark of Australian society . <p> " It 's a sign of the health of any pluralist society that people are prepared to give in the interests of society without being paid , " he said . <p> " I think if you start paying people just because your organisation has money , you wo n't improve the quality of those whom you get , you might even put off some who want to be volunteers , they want to do good without payment . I 'm all against payment . " <p> However Haigh , prolific sports journalist and contributor to the debate on governance in sport , argued remuneration facilitated diversity on boards , which , he said , " people seem to regard ... as a commendable outcome " . <p> " There are good people who can not afford to be on boards , who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There was recently a discussion that the AFL needed an Indigenous commission member , but really , there are very few Indigenous people who are capable of devoting the necessary amounts of time to be an AFL commission member without some sort of financial incentive . " <p> Anderson , director of the Fulbright Commission and Epworth HealthCare , and chair of The Good Foundation , said there were means outside remuneration to achieve board diversity . <p> " I do like diversity and I do want to bring others along , I actually architect the meeting time and agenda to suit people who have to work full-time , but they want to get that experience and engage , " Anderson said . <p> " I agree with what you were saying Allan , I do n't think you get better performance just by paying someone at all , I do n't think that works . <p> " I also think it 's important for inclusion to include the diversity of aspiring contributors who may not have the financial resources behind them to engage ... again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Myers then reiterated his argument that remuneration would not attract better directors . <p> " If you 're talking about people who are volunteering , they 're not going to be , mostly , young people who are making their way along in life , for example , who might have children and are trying to get established in an occupation , business or profession , " he said . <p> " A lot of this volunteering is for old girls and old blokes like me , who can do something useful which requires experience which has been reflected upon , which produces what is called wisdom . <p> " And I just do n't know that you 're going to get better people by paying them . I 'm not against ensuring people who ca n't afford to be out of pocket by being on a not for profit are not given passage money , or sitting fee or something like that , but not salaries for goodness sake . " <p> At this point the facilitator ended the debate , moving onto the next audience question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said paying directors could lead to better board performance . <p> " Some organisations now , in the not-for-profit space , are handling very , very large sums of money . Therefore they have higher and higher expectations of directors , and in order to get directors to pay the necessary amount of attention to their responsibilities , it seems to me common sense that in certain cases payment should be de rigueur , " he said . <p> " I think lack of payment tends to affect what organisations are prepared to ask of their directors , it might mean that you only ask your directors to come together six times a year , or you do n't really expect them to read board papers all that closely , and that , to me , is inherently sub-optimal . " <p> Haigh said directors should reflect the communities not for profits serve , which requires remuneration . <p> " If they really want to be representative of the wider public , then they have to be prepared to encourage interest from people who are n't independently wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to donate their time , " he said . <p> " I think as a general principle , you can just be too puritanical about these things . <p> " Your services are not simply going to be allocated to the independently wealthy , or the 50-plus or the white male . If you want to be genuinely representative , then you actually have to have a board that reflects that , and I fear sometimes with not for profits that they 're restricting their own gene pool of influences .

 <p> Tackling the Magnification of Recruitment Risk in the NFP , 7th March 2017 at 7:59 am <p> Not for profits of all sizes can use the global online candidate referencing system Xref to protect themselves against fraud and breaches in discrimination and privacy while saving time and money . <p> Visit Xref 's website to find out how they can help your organisation get the best candidates and make better hiring decisions . <p> The not-for-profit sector undoubtedly has its unique challenges . However , at the heart of any organisation , the key priorities remain the same ensuring productivity and an optimal service for end users by finding , securing and retaining the best people to be successful . And that quest for success is arguably more important for not-for-profit organisations , given the sensitive nature of the problems many are tackling . <p> Finding the right people is not just vital for commercial gain but also to ensure that the service delivered to potentially vulnerable individuals is of a consistently high standard , and that the valuable funds spent on personnel is defendable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a success ? To be blunt , without a magic eight ball , there really is no guarantee , but there are steps that can be taken to ensure an organisation is as well-placed as it can be to make good hiring decisions . <p> One of those steps is in streamlining and bullet-proofing the reference checking process . After all , a candidate may be able to represent themselves well on paper or during an interview , but it 's the people who have worked with them previously that will be able to validate or question their claims . <p> The reality is that many not-for-profit organisations are n't doing reference checking well , because they do n't have the vast recruitment teams seen in large corporate organisations , they are relying on archaic , manual , phone-based methods of collecting the data , and they have no measures in place to ensure they are even speaking to legitimate referees . Not only is this wasting valuable time and resources , it is also putting NFPs at significant risk of making a bad hiring decision and employing someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical role of the organisation . <p> Xref recently conducted research to demonstrate just how serious this issue is . Although it 's somewhat socially accepted that jobseekers will bend the truth a little when applying for work , the results of the survey , which included responses from 1,000 Australian jobseekers , highlighted the alarming number of people willing to deceive potential employers . <p> So , what were the key findings and what do they mean for the not-for-profit sector ? <p> 1 . Australian jobseekers are willing to " fake it to make it " <p> The research found that 71 per cent of respondents admitted to having exploited flaws in the reference checking process , most commonly by avoiding choosing someone who might give a bad reference ( 56 per cent ) and choosing an individual likely to provide a good reference , rather than the most appropriate person ( 51 per cent ) . These statistics are n't so alarming until you hear that 42 per cent also admitted to having deliberately lied to a potential employer , through exaggeration and misrepresentation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents were willing to admit they 'd actively encouraged a referee to lie on their behalf . <p> Although one would like to think those looking to work in the not-for-profit sector would be a reputable bunch , the desire to land the perfect role will often unfortunately outweigh moral values . The result is an immense risk for not-for-profit organisations , should the worst happen , they would have little in the way of an audit trail to defend their hiring decisions , if traditional reference checking processes were used . <p> 2 . Employers are also failing to comply <p> Beyond the issues associated with candidates , Xref also found that inconsistencies and a lack of experience driving reference checking led to 29 per cent of those who had acted as a referee being asked discriminatory questions about the candidate . These included the candidate 's age ( 15 per cent ) , whether the candidate has children ( 11 per cent ) , their marital status ( 10 per cent ) and their sexual orientation ( 7 per cent ) . <p> The issues of equal opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation but none more so than the not for profits , which would come under huge scrutiny should a candidate be seen to have been turned away illegally . <p> 3 . Resources are being wasted and talent lost <p> With the ease at which candidates can apply for multiple roles , it is rarely the case that an organisation will have no competition for the best talent available . We found that 84 per cent of respondents had applied for two or more jobs in the past two years , and 30 per cent had applied for 10 or more . <p> What makes this more worrying is that 42 per cent of candidates had abandoned their job applications , specifically due to delays at the reference checking stage . <p> Getting that process right while being able to complete it efficiently , is absolutely critical to ensuring you get the best people through the door before they go elsewhere . Given the constant scrutiny on not for profit spending , money wasted on recruitment processes that are seen to deliver no results due to their inefficiencies , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 . Reference checking is a critical process regarded as a chore <p> Picking up the phone to discuss a candidate is often left to the most junior person on the team , given it 's laborious and time-consuming nature . It 's seen as a burden and a distraction from other more valuable work . Perhaps because of this , Xref 's research identified that 19 per cent of references go completely unchecked . <p> When time and money is tight , it can be tempting to cut corners to get people through the door . The irony is that when the process is not done properly , it can actually take longer , produce less insight , and put the organisation at risk in the long-term . <p> For a sector in need of efficiency , validity and accuracy , the use of automated , secure solutions such as Xref to overcome the risks and downfalls of tired , old business processes such as reference checking will ensure that NFPs not only survive but thrive into the future . 
 <p> also wants the government to convene a digital inclusion summit to be held in the second half of 2017 to explore more ideas of how to address digital disadvantage with the aim of boosting jobs and opportunities . <p> According to the Australian Digital Inclusion Index ( ADII ) , SA performs poorly . The South Australian ADII summary score is 51.6 points , which is 5.3 per cent below the national average of 54.5 , and 13.5 per cent lower than the ACT which is the best performing jurisdiction . SA rates second last above Tasmania . <p> " We know that large numbers of disadvantaged South Australians do not have the phone and internet access needed for job-hunting and training , and to interact with businesses and government departments , " Womersley said . <p> " This digital disadvantage is coupled with continuing high levels of unemployment and underemployment . " <p> He said the issue was not just one for young unemployed people or older people . <p> " It 's a combination at both ends of the spectrum . And the other group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may be refugees or they may be people who have been here for many , many years but have not developed their literacy and they rely on family members to keep them connected , " he said . <p> " research released late last year identified that low-income people struggle to afford essential telecommunications services which is why we are also recommending the provision of un-metered free access to all sa.gov.au websites . <p> " We need a strategy to boost skills in IT and to boost affordability and access . We want to see SA lead the other states in digital inclusion within the next 10 years . <p> " The digital world is not stopping . We need a statewide plan and a national plan . " <p> He said , by convening a summit later this year , South Australia could take into account where it was placed in terms of digital inclusion and the challenges ahead . 
 <p> After speaking to purpose-driven leaders , Mike Davis , founder of Purposeful , has distilled his learnings into three elements of great not-for-profit leadership . <p> Recently , I have been thinking more and more about leadership and the key traits that are important in how great leaders can get the most out of their people , resources and organisational strategy . <p> Earlier in the month I was lucky enough to be offered a discounted ticket to see Simon Sinek speak at the Growth Faculty workshop at Melbourne Convention and Exhibition and Centre . <p> Simon reminded us that bizarrely -- there is still no universal and established definition of " leadership " or what makes great leadership . Although , there are a number of models , frameworks and well researched and published theories . <p> A few weeks ago , I was interviewed by Victor Perton of Australian Leadership to further develop my thoughts . I have also been lucky enough to join some of Australia 's most inspiring purpose-driven leaders as part of our new fortnightly Humans of Purpose podcast . <p> Here are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my short career working in the public service , with not for profits , social enterprises , purpose-driven businesses , SMEs and as founding director of Purposeful . <p> Great leaders are resourceful <p> This means they know where the relevant capabilities are in the organisation and how to deploy them . <p> They will also take this further by understanding how people want to grow , what challenges will allow them to grow and how they can delegate tasks so that they can be the best version of themselves at work . <p> Some of the best leaders I 've worked with are also able to generate great gains in human capital and people development by assembling diverse teams with skills and capabilities in complementary areas . <p> Great leaders are inclusive <p> The best leaders I 've seen and worked with have always placed a great emphasis on making sure victories belong to the team and not the individual . <p> They also tend to understand the importance of pulling people into projects and organisational development in a way that makes the most of their latent capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior team members with key tasks and deliverables important to the project 's success and then to praise their contribution as pivotal to generating successful outcomes . <p> Great leaders are empowering <p> I 'm a firm believer that people have unlimited potential to learn and develop new skills , but also to master them and become really great at deploying them . <p> The best way to enable this is to empower and trust junior team members with tasks and responsibilities outside their traditional workflows and comfort zone . <p> An empowering approach will call for more support , mentoring and encouragement , but will ultimately produce a stronger group of performers with diverse skills . <p> So what do all these traits have in common and why are they important ? They will all allow you to make your people feel safe at work , feel trusted and come to work motivated by a shared purpose . If you are a leader or want to become one , consider Sinek 's simple but profound advice : <p> " Be the leader you wish you had .

 <p> The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission wants to see secrecy provisions that prevent it from revealing details about charity wrongdoings removed in this year 's review of the ACNC Act . <p> The ACNC 's second Charity Compliance Report , released Wednesday , said there were many lessons charities could learn from compliance matters and sharing this information would contribute to a " robust , vibrant , independent and innovative sector " . <p> While the report on ACNC activities from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016 included the names of 28 charities that had their registration revoked , two charities that entered into enforceable undertakings and one charity that received a statutory warning , further details could not be provided . <p> The case studies and other statistics , including the ACNC 's 69 finalised investigations , relied on aggregated data and de-identified information . <p> " To be honest , the secrecy provisions that the ACNC has in the legislation really gives us difficulty in carrying out our purposes properly , " Locke said . <p> " What we would like to do is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out what the findings were and what the basic facts were around that . <p> " We think that would provide much better accountability for us to the community , and people would be able to understand what 's going on , whereas actually it 's very hard . Journalists are digging around trying to see what actually is the case here , and we 're not able to say anything . <p> " So we think it 's not satisfactory . " <p> He said it was one of the issues the ACNC would like to have looked at when the act is reviewed in December . <p> " Built into our legislation is a five-year review , and we 've got a list of things that we think could be significantly improved , one of them is this , " he said . <p> " We think at the conclusion of an investigation we should be able to set out what our findings are and what some of the facts are . <p> " Of course when we open an investigation , some of these can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , or actually everything 's wound up . <p> " But it 's still right that we actually , where there 's serious concerns , make findings as to whether they are proved or disproved . <p> " If there 's allegations that somebody 's stolen money from the charity , it 's right that the regulator identifies whether that 's the case or not . " <p> Locke said the secrecy provisions were just one item on a list of improvements the ACNC would like implemented . <p> This includes the scope of punishment when a charity has its status revoked and the ACNC 's compliance powers . <p> " The ACNC can revoke a charity status but actually the charity is able to continue operating , it just is n't able to access Commonwealth tax concessions , " Locke said . <p> " In some jurisdictions , such as New Zealand and Canada , there are provisions in tax legislation that require the entity to be wound up within the defined period of time , and the assets transferred over , so I think things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACNC 's powers in respect of compliance , many of them are limited to whether a charity is federally regulated or not , and that 's a constitutional question that requires legal advice . " <p> The regulator also wants to see the act changed to allow improvements to its Charity Register , benefiting both charities and the wider community . <p> Currently , the register can only include information that 's specifically outlined in the ACNC Act and regulations . <p> " For example , the register does n't show whether a charity is a DGR or not , " Locke said . <p> " But actually if you 're looking at it as a member of the public and wanting to give money , then that would be a very useful piece of information on there . <p> " The regulations do n't say you can put the charity 's charitable purpose on the register , which is clearly an oversight . <p> " We 've got a piece of work that we 've started at the moment looking at how we can significantly improve the register , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to do that . " <p> Locke said another important change would be regulations around who can be a board member of a charity . <p> " If you look at the people who are disqualified from being a board member of a charity , really it 's anybody who has been removed as a board member by ASIC or by the ACNC commissioner or is disqualified under the ASIC legislation , " he said . <p> " That means people who are undischarged bankrupts or who 've got serious convictions for dishonesty are disqualified . <p> " But somebody is n't automatically disqualified even if they have , for example , convictions for child sex offences or convictions for terrorist-related activity . <p> " So we do think there 's probably a need to have a look at whether the list of disqualifying offences is sufficient really because obviously those would be issues of serious concern in terms of harm to beneficiaries ' application of charitable funds . " <p> The report highlighted the increased media scrutiny the charity sector has faced over the last several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Over the two-year scope of the report , the ACNC received 1,872 concerns about charities , mostly from the public or people working in the sector . <p> In the foreword , ACNC commissioner Susan Pascoe AM said this was a " significant increase " from the previous two years when the regulator received 1,307 concerns . <p> The ACNC opened 149 per cent more investigations in response to the additional concerns . <p> Locke put the increase in complaints down to greater awareness of the ACNC . <p> " I do n't think it 's a big surprise , I think there 's a bit of a lifecycle with charity regulators and probably other regulators as well , " he said . <p> " The first few years , really , you 're concentrating on ... education , guidance , explaining to the community and to charities what the new regime means , what organisations have to do . <p> " And then it 's really about , as we 've done , go through the process , identify which charities are active , and tidy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports and providing financial information , you have much more information and intelligence about where the risks are in the sector and what 's going on . <p> " And also ... as the agency gets higher-profile , then you get more complaints and concerns . So for us , we 've always realised there 'd be more compliance activity over time . " <p> He also reiterated that the vast majority of charities do the right thing . <p> " What this concentrates on is the cases where things have gone really badly wrong in organisations , and you can see from the numbers that we 're not talking about massive numbers of organisations , considering there 's over 54,000 charities on the register , " he said . <p> " It 's about getting it into proportion ... yes , this concentrates on where there 's big issues , big governance failings or where there 's fraud and corruption , but actually it needs to be read in the whole context of the sector . " <p> However , in light of increased media and public scrutiny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not necessarily immune from the charity trust crisis happening in the UK . <p> " A lot of the issues that have happened in the UK ... have been to do with fundraising and to do with either the use of donor 's data information , or to do with fundraising methods , and third-party providers , " he said . <p> " Do I think that we 're immune here ? I do n't . <p> " I think that there is a real need for charities to take seriously the governance of the information that they hold about people , and also in terms of the fundraising methods that they undertake . <p> " In short I 'm saying there 's a real need for us to learn the lessons from the UK and not repeat the mistakes . " <p> Over the next 12 to 24 months , the ACNC said its compliance focus would be on fraud and financial mismanagement , terrorism , harm to beneficiaries and political activities . 
 <p> What Is the Role of Funders in Social Impact Matters ? Wednesday , 15th March 2017 at 8:10 am <p> Often philanthropists are not familiar or experienced enough in local issues to be dictating how social impact is reported , writes Alan Kay , coordinator of the UK 's Social Audit Network . <p> " He who pays the piper calls the tune " is an old British saying . <p> The explanation in Cambridge Dictionary : " The saying is said to emphasise that the person who is paying someone to do something can decide how it should be done ... " <p> This saying is widely used and often in connection with funders and investors those who provide funds to enable social economy organisations to get on and do things that have social or community benefit . <p> There is a fine dividing line between those that provide the financial resources and those organisations that carry out the work . How much right have funders in dictating what the work should be , who should do it , how it should be done and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy and straightforward relationship , as often the funders are not always fully aware of the context , do not always understand the difficulties in the delivery of services , and , at times , can get overly involved in how the delivery organisation is managed and how it reports . <p> At times those who provide the money can overstep the mark . I used to work with overseas aid organisations and UK government departments that provided much of the funding in the 1980s and they used to dictate to the aid organisations which consultants they should use , what suppliers they should buy from and so on . In a benign way , this may have been meant to be helpful ; but at worst it could be seen as interfering and dictatorial . <p> In the distant past when I worked for a community enterprise support organisation in Scotland we received a grant from the local council . Each year we were expected to report on how the money had been spent . They trusted us to deliver beneficial impacts arising from how the money had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation has changed dramatically . Organisations in receipt of funding are now asked to provide proof of the positive differences that they have made -- and , on top of this , the funders themselves are increasingly getting involved in how an organisation reports on its social and community impact.This may be very positive but I feel it is important to understand that there is now a shift in the relationship between funders and the recipients and that this shift may not be entirely positive . <p> It comes down to who actually is guiding the social and community change . Should it be funders with often limited staff most of whom have distribution and monitoring roles ? Or should it be the delivery organisations who know the social and community needs , the local situations and the way needs can be addressed ? <p> As the UK currently appears to be turning its back on Europe and aping the culture and traditions of the United States , we are placing more emphasis on philanthropy as a substitute for state funding especially in areas of social and community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying trend as economically successful individuals are now resorting to use the profit they have gained from neoliberal business practices in doing " good " . Often , they will want to give " something back " through redistribution to those less well-off . There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this , but the nature of the relationship between the philanthropic funder and the recipient requires more open understanding . <p> There are a number of factors that can be considered in understanding this relationship : <p> Funders often want to fund organisations that are familiar to them in what they do , and how they practice . <p> Funders are sometimes remote from the sharp end of delivery . What do they really know of juggling social and business objectives , of having to lay people off , of struggling to make ends meet ? <p> Funders will often talk of working in partnership . But is it really a partnership when one partner wields financial power over another ? <p> When it comes to reporting back on the difference made by the recipients of the funds are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real change that has happened or just on a bunch of targets . <p> So now turning to social impact . In the Social Audit Network we believe that the monitoring and evaluation process should be owned and controlled by the organisation . Without doubt , the recipient of funds should report back to a funder on what has been done with the money and what difference has occurred -- but the control of the evaluation should be empowering the organisation and not undermining it by funders pushing for only their agenda to be addressed . <p> We argue that accounting for social and community change is an integral part of what a social economy organisation should be doing . And perhaps more controversially , we feel that funders are just one of a number of stakeholder groups that have to be reported to ... they are often highly influential stakeholders but should not be dominant . <p> Another important element to reporting on social impact , is that mechanistic and highly structured impact reporting can miss the point . <p> I read an Australian article recently called The Politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Active Citizenship " . The author , Jenny Onyx , argues that we can get too bogged down in filling out output , outcome and impact boxes that we miss the point of how a community-based organisation can have a wider impact on local and active citizenship with all the socialistic , caring , roles and responsibilities attached to that . <p> So , having said all this what 's to be done ? I met a representative from a large funding organisation in Scotland recently . They stressed listening , partnership , exchange , trust , openness and I agreed with them . <p> But the relationship is often precarious but here goes with some suggestions : <p> Trust is often quoted glibly but it is crucially important as the basis between a funder and a recipient . The thing about trust is that it takes time and shared experience to build up and , unfortunately , can be broken easily and suddenly . <p> Linked to trust is for both parties to adopt a more enlightened attitude to failure . If funders recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new things tried , and importantly learning can result from failed attempts . <p> If possible , funders should be less prescriptive in how an organisation reports on the difference it is making . Of course , some parameters need to be set down and agreed but the contextual situation should be understood fully by both parties . <p> There is also an issue over size and familiarity . Generally , those providing funds want to deal with larger organisations with recognisable " business " systems and procedures . This is often to the exclusion of smaller organisations . This tension around " size " will not go away especially when neoliberal economic systems measure success by how much entities have " grown " . There may be a way of getting round this but I am not sure what it is . <p> Finally , and to go back to the quote at the beginning arguably " he " in the saying should learn from social economy organisations how to play the pipes and learn the tune before putting his hand in the funding pocket ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the UK 's Social Audit Network a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates the exchange of information and experience between practitioners of social accounting and audit in the social economy and voluntary sectors .

 <h> Victoria Takes a Lead in Fundraising Reform <p> In the coming months Australia 's charity sector has an opportunity to take a huge step forward in fundraising regulation reform , with Victoria leading the way , writes CEO of Community Council for Australia , David Crosbie . <p> Victoria Takes a Lead in Fundraising , 16th March 2017 at 8:37 am <p> In the coming months Australia 's charity sector has an opportunity to take a huge step forward in fundraising regulation reform , with Victoria leading the way , writes CEO of Community Council for Australia , David Crosbie . <p> On Wednesday Victoria took a major step forward in supporting the campaign . A court decision and an agenda-setting speech from a minister in the Victorian government have boosted the case for reform . <p> Most readers of Pro Bono News know that fundraising regulations in Australia are a classic example of ineffective regulation , duplication and red tape.The existing regime is grounded in an outmoded hangover of federalism requiring charities to comply with seven separate sets of administrative requirements . Perhaps just as importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 50,000-plus charities do not comply with all the requirements , even if they are engaged in fundraising . <p> For more than two decades charities have been seeking to make the system workable . Academics like Professor Myles McGregor Lowndes , not-for-profit law specialists and even the Productivity Commission have all pushed for reform . <p> Over the next month or so , the charity sector has an opportunity to take a huge step forward in fundraising regulation reform . The current review of Australian consumer law ( ACL ) is an important doorway to harmonisation . The ACL can easily be clarified and amended to ensure charities are required to meet a clear set of consumer-focused expectations and requirements in all their fundraising activities . We do not need seven sets of onerous and ineffective regulations . <p> CCA understands that the main barrier to achieving reform is not a lack of a policy solution or even state reluctance to let go of their regulatory role , the problem appears to be that key ministers and policy makers could not be bothered because it is not considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape for business is essential , cutting red tape for charities is not . <p> When the Victorian Federal Court handed down a judgement on the fraudster Belle Gibson in a case brought by the Victorian Commissioner for Consumer Affairs , the decision highlighted how the existing consumer law can be applied to someone misleading people by saying they are providing money to a charitable purpose when they are not . This is an important judgement because it clearly demonstrates that the consumer law can be an effective way of addressing inappropriate fundraising practices . Breaching Victorian fundraising regulations was not at issue . Breaching consumer law was . <p> What made this action and decision in Victoria even more significant was the statement made by the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs Marlene Kairouz at an invitation only meeting of consumer affairs ministers and policy makers on the same day . <p> In part of her speech , she said : " The review of the Australian consumer law concludes next month when consumer affairs officials present their final report to all consumer affairs ministers for consideration . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build its evidence base and I know that many of you present today have contributed your knowledge and experience , whether that be in survey responses , face-to-face interviews , or formal submissions . Thank you for your input . <p> I 'm also aware that among the issues you have championed is that of nationally consistent fundraising regulation to both improve the clarity of the ACL 's application and to reduce regulatory burden . <p> " Research undertaken for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in 2016 showed that state and territory regulation of charities ( including fundraising regulation ) imposed costs to registered charities of over $15 million per year . <p> " This is money wasted and just one reason why I support your calls to overhaul this aspect of the ACL . While I would hope that my colleagues in other jurisdictions are of a similar mind , the reality is that evolution for some looks akin to revolution for others and achieving a consistent view will be a challenge . <p> " Nonetheless , I will continue to advocate for national reform while taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for profits operating in Victoria . <p> " Legislation currently in the Parliament will enable me to exempt an incorporated association or a class of associations from annual financial reporting requirements where they are also registered with and reporting to another regulator . " <p> Clearly Victoria gets it . We know some other jurisdictions are now on the same page . But we still have quite a way to go to achieve the goal of harmonised fundraising grounded in the appropriate application of Australian consumer law combined with the registration role of the Australian <p> Charities and Not-for-profits Commission . The federal government is yet to offer support and at least two jurisdictions have adopted the " why bother " policy position . <p> CCA is a member of the campaign and will be part of proposed activities over the coming months . <p> If we do not campaign and campaign hard on these issues , they will yet again slip off the policy agenda , and we in the charities sector will be left wringing our hands wondering why our concerns are not being taken seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the charities sector and responding . <p> I look forward to a vigorous campaign over the coming months to ensure the federal government and other jurisdictions get on board .

 <p> A " game-changing " new partnership has been formed in a bid to raise awareness of mental health and change workplace culture so " it 's OK to not always be OK " . <p> Disability not for profit EPIC Assist ( EPIC ) has joined forces with Mental Health at Work ( email protected ) , a consultancy aimed at improving wellbeing and productivity of people and workplaces , to educate employers through a series of workshops . <p> As part of the partnership EPIC , who already run Disability Awareness workshops , will extend their suite of training to include face-to-face Managing Mental Health in the Workplace workshops with content created by email protected founder and managing director Ingrid Ozols . <p> Ozols said they wanted to support employers to " be brave and employ people with mental health challenges and disabilities , and not fear doing this " . <p> " Because at the moment , there 's still a hell of a lot of stigma , and that 's just making things worse , " Ozols said . <p> " We need to enable all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have some confidence in having . <p> " Our goal is to change the culture of workplaces ; to create organisations where it 's safe , it 's supportive and it 's OK to not always be OK . " <p> Ozols founded email protected 16 years ago after she identified a prevalence of mental health issues in the workplace , but found no resources available to help those that needed them most . <p> " I 've always been someone that people came to with deeply personal information , and the further involved in HR I became , the more time I spent listening to people 's problems , " Ozols said . <p> " I was required to speak to people about performance issues at work , but my gut was saying , ' there seems to be more of an issue here ' . Their work performance was being impacted , but it was because of these other health issues . " <p> Ozols also has lived experience of mental health . <p> " All my life I 've been living , loving and working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived her life , especially during my childhood , in and out of psych hospitals , " she said . <p> " I was her carer from a young age , but we never talked about it . All I knew was she had ' bad nerves ' and we had to walk on eggshells around her . <p> " I was diagnosed with a mental illness which first showed up when I was seven or eight . I 've had thoughts of suicide , and did in fact try to kill myself several times when I was 18 or 19 . <p> " As I went through university , having Bipolar Disorder was really , really difficult . I did n't know what I was dealing with , I just thought I was weird . <p> " As my working life started , I began to see that this was quite common and a lot of people experience all sorts of mental illness , but we never talked about it and never knew what to do with it . " <p> Ozols , who has held leadership roles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supported Decision Making Committee and Wild at Heart , said she wanted to use her knowledge where she felt it would be " best placed " . <p> " I took a lot of what I learnt back to the workplace because I knew that was where they needed the help , because of what I 'd experienced , " she said . <p> " When I went looking for help to get skills , there was nothing out there . I knew I needed it and was sure a whole lot of other HR managers needed it too . " <p> She said there was still a widespread reluctance for employees to disclose mental health issues which was having a detrimental impact not only on individuals , but on organisations more broadly . <p> " Most employers and workplaces have already got a lot of people with these challenges , but they may not be aware of it because there 's still a real reluctance to disclose , " she said . <p> " People are afraid to say ' look , I have this vulnerability or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their job , or be managed out of their job , or ignored . " <p> She said there has been a rise in awareness but there was still work to be done . <p> " There 's been a lot of awareness but now we need to take it to the next level , " Ozols said . <p> " Through this partnership , we can actually make a difference to a lot of people 's lives , to help them get employed and stay employed . " <p> Ozols said she was pleased to be teaming up with EPIC , to make " an even greater impact in workplaces " . <p> " This partnership will bring together disability , mental health and suicide prevention , because we know a lot of people who have a disability also experience mental health issues , " Ozols said . <p> " We are human and there is that overlap . We 're not one or the other , we 're both . " <p> The first phase of the partnership is now underway with Ozols training a group of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops , with two more mental health trainers set to join the team in the near future . <p> As a prerequisite to becoming trainers , EPIC staff were required to have either lived experience of mental illness , or qualifications in mental health and training . <p> " She is a remarkable person . Ingrid 's decision to impart her knowledge through this partnership will mean a real change in the lives of countless Australians , " Gamack said . <p> " An increase in mental health awareness in Australia in recent years means many new mental health workshops have been coming out of the woodwork . But the value of true expertise like Ingrid 's can not be overstated , and I have no doubt this will shine through in our workshops . " <p> EPIC identified several benefits to employers to being well-informed and confident in managing employees with mental illness : <p> increased tenure and fewer absences <p> reduced recruitment and retraining costs for the business <p> competitiveness in procurement and tender processes <p> improved staff morale , staff feeling safe at work <p> a diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining confidence to disclose mental illness <p> increase your status as an employer of choice . <p> " We spend so much of our lives at work ; fostering a supportive and accepting work environment is a win-win for employees and employers , " Gamack said . <p> " Employees that feel supported and understood at work carry that confidence into other parts of their lives .

She is this week 's Changemaker . <p> Dr Nicky Howe is an author , leadership and management coach , and CEO of Southcare , an award winning not-for-profit organisation in Western Australia offering aged and community care services . She is this week 's Changemaker . <p> Howe has a passion for building the capacity of individuals , organisations and communities . <p> Over the course of a career spanning three decades she has become a confident leader and experienced senior executive , working across government and not-for-profit sectors in the areas of employment , education , welfare , health , aged care and community services . <p> In partnership with Alicia Curtis , Howe co-founded the Engaging Young Leaders on Aged Care and Community Boards governance program . To date 40 per cent of graduates have secured board positions and more than 20 per cent are completing board traineeships . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share their findings in a book Difference Makers . <p> Howe is also the author of Better Relationships with Those You Lead , a handbook of practical skills and strategies for leaders and managers . <p> In this week 's Changemaker she talks about the elusive obvious , why her organisation is like a yacht , and why , when the world is falling around you , you have to show up at work the same way . <p> What attracted you to the not-for-profit sector ? <p> The not-for-profit sector has always had a sense of being on the edge , a bit out there , trying to be at the forefront of really addressing the issues of society . For me , the thing that attracts me to that is it 's a great place to create , to innovate , to really challenge the status quo around how things are and actually saying well , we can do better than that . We can change that or we can create something new , we can innovate . So that 's really I think what attracted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom in working in the not-for-profit sector as opposed to working in government or possibly the corporate sector . <p> What do you enjoy most about your job as CEO of Southcare ? <p> I think in some ways it parallels . It is a great privilege to be a CEO of an organisation , there is no doubt about that . It is a great privilege because you are again , able to create , to be innovative , to build a business that is valued by community , is valued by the staff , by the volunteers , so I think it aligns for me , really similarly , around why I choose to work in the sector . <p> At times it can be quite a tumultuous environment and I think I like that . I often reflect and think to myself , I 'm much better at change and risk and all of that than I am with stability . The thought of things being constant and the same , I 'd be bored . It 's not that I 'm an adrenalin junkee but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we can do more . So that 's probably another thing that drives me . <p> What 's the most challenging aspect of your role ? <p> In some ways it is the same thing . I have this sort of analogy about us as an organisation and I think , because we 're medium sized , we 're this sort of reasonably small yacht on what is quite a rough sea at the moment . Particularly , I 'm in aged care , so here you are and you 're really trying to navigate through all the reforms , all the changes and you 're really trying to identify the right strategy and also trying to really keep focused around what you 're doing . <p> So the challenge is always , how do you get out there and create the future , while you 're trying to maintain and do the business . I always feel like I 've got one foot sitting in the yacht and with the other one I 've got to be flying right out on the edge . I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , but what 's going on in the other sectors , what 's actually going on in the world and how can I bring that difference and diversity to what we 're doing , to try and make it better , make it different . <p> I do n't notice it all the time but I must admit I was talking to some colleagues of mine recently and at some point there is a low level of anxiety . And when I notice that I 've got to say to myself what is it about the uncertainty that you do n't accept ? You just have to accept the uncertainty because that anxiety is driven by not accepting the uncertainty . <p> What makes a good leader ? <p> I 've given that a lot of thought , you know , what does make a good leader . And I think , you hear this word authenticity and I really struggled with this word , about what does that really mean , but I do think that good leaders are being themselves . Because when they 're being themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's actually what we need in leadership , we need to give of ourselves , which is the gifts and talents and strengths that I hold , and you will hold different gifts and strengths and talents . So that sense of authenticity , showing up as who you are I think is really important because you do n't have to then worry about putting on some sort of display . <p> If you are always showing up as you then they do trust you because they see you in all your strengths and all your vulnerabilities and all your foibles . I think that that is a really important thing . <p> We talk about , good leaders having a vision and a purpose and I do think that is important without a doubt . People want to know that you are taking them somewhere and that they have got something to look towards so I think that that is a really important thing . I do think think you have to be reliable , I think when you 're not reliable , that immediately breaks down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust you , because you are reliable , and you are consistent , you 're likeable . <p> The other thing I think is really important and I really try and drive that , is you have to be able to maintain an equilibrium . So when all the world around you is falling down , you have to show up at work the same way . So for me , everyday I walk into work I say " good morning " , and go round and see everybody , always maintain that same equilibrium even if inside I am thinking to myself " what 's going on " or " they do n't know yet but we did n't get that contract " so I think equilibrium , our capacity to manage ourselves before we manage others is a core leadership trait . <p> You launched the Engaging Young Leaders on Aged Care and Community Boards program with Alicia Curtis . Why is it important to encourage young leaders in the sector ? <p> I think business fundamentally needs diversity . I think we can not solve our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity . We have to have everybody stepping up to the table , so when we leave out a group , whatever group that might be , I think we are completely doing ourselves a disservice , we 're doing our organisation a disservice , society and of course at the core of that is the person we 're not including . <p> So that 's why I think it is so important and I think it is really important to encourage young leaders into our sector because if we do n't , firstly , the sector will just not survive because it just wo n't have the people in it that it needs to actually run it . We are one of the biggest industries , not only in our nation but in the world , aged care is a massive industry . <p> I think we need them , because we need them to help us create what it should look like for the future . Our mantra is we want to build a world-class aged care and community sector , that 's our vision and we strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just wo n't happen . So you 've got all these stats and facts around what the business benefits are , what the social benefits are and that 's why I think diversity is so important . <p> What has been the biggest success of the program ? <p> It was really interesting , when I reflected on this question , I thought I can throw a whole load of stats , I can say we 've got 76 people who 've graduated , we 've got another 20 who 've just started , we 've got over 60 per cent now that went through our program who are on boards as board directors , 25 per cent have undertaken a board traineeship , we 've got 38 community partners who help fund this program , both financial and in kind , we 've run eight conventions and we 've got an online toolkit , we 've got a book . I can tell you all that . <p> But when I reflect and I say to myself , what 's the biggest difference ? The biggest difference for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me and say to me : " Are you crazy ? What you 're asking me to do Nicky is to suggest to my board that we will put a young person on my board . " And I said " " Yes , that 's exactly what I 'm suggesting . " Last year , he signed up as a community partner . They have embraced the program , they want to get a young person on their board . <p> So when I think about this idea of success , I thought to myself the biggest success is we are shifting mindsets . That 's what we 're doing . And it is only through us shifting these mindsets that we actually get all those other things . We ca n't get the person on the board or the traineeship or the online tool kit or the convention or the community partners if we have n't shifted their thinking . So for me , I think that is the big success . That people now do n't think I 'm crazy . <p> You know how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crazy and then all of a sudden that step actually does n't seem that far anymore . It actually seems the elusive obvious . It 's like " yeah well , whatever mate , it 's pretty obvious , of course you 're going to put young people on the board " , well that 's what they 're saying now . But they did n't say that five years ago . So that 's the success to me . <p> You have recently written Difference Makers , A Leader 's Guide to Championing Diversity on Boards with Alicia Curtis . What is the main take away you would like to see people get from the book ? <p> The takeaway is that diversity makes sense both economically and for civil society . That 's the takeaway . Again , the things we 're saying in the book it 's like : " Yeah , this makes sense , it is obvious , and by the way here is a whole load of ways that you can do it . " <p> Alicia and I are very much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be big , but do something . So our book is really trying to contribute into that space of saying : " Look here 's all the research , here 's all the evidence , here 's some easy ways to do it and here 's some stories of average people that have done it and so you can do it too . " It 's a practitioner 's book . I 'm a practitioner so for me everything is about knowing is doing . You can say you know it but have you done it ? Get on and do it . Do n't procrastinate . Life is short . <p> You were nominated as a finalist in the 2014 Telstra Business Women 's Awards , how does it feel to be recognised for the work you are doing ? <p> You always feel a bit humbled by that recognition , when you stand up there and you get recognised for something you do feel humbled . I felt really appreciative actually . And I also was extremely energised to do more . I think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a finalist , you did n't win , you say to yourself , " well actually I need to step up even further " , not necessarily to win , but there is more you could do . You can get better . <p> The other thing of course is it gives you exposure to your cause , which is actually why you want to win . You want to win because you go , if I win then more people will know about my cause , because I have got the airspace now to tell them . <p> Through your work what is your ultimate goal ? <p> My ultimate purpose is always about building capability and capacity of people and whether that is the organisation , the sector or society . So that is what I 'm fundamentally interested in . I am fundamentally interested in people and how you can help them to feel proud , valued , trusted , empowered and committed to achieve . Often my interactions are with staff as opposed to with the customer , but it is for me about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I empower them , how can I enrich their lives , what is it that I can do to help them along their way . <p> How do you make time for yourself ? <p> I am quite selfish around some particular rituals that I do , and ... that is that whole thing of self-management . I wake up in the morning , do a few stretches , I always go for a walk with my dog . My morning time is very important to me , so that is my time for exercise and wellbeing and reflection , to try and just reflect what is going on . I 'm not a girl who misses a meal . I think there are some fundamental things about keeping well and maintaining your wellbeing and they are really basic things like diet and exercise . Look , I do like a glass of Shiraz . So I do make sure I make time for myself , I do have that down time . I do yoga and mindfulness , I will go on retreats . I do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need down time . And my husband and I we love playing pool , we play pool , we 've got a competition board and so I think it 's some real basic things . If you do n't make time for yourself that 's when you ca n't maintain that equilibrium . If you start missing meals and eating junk , you do n't get enough sleep , you do n't exercise , then you 're really not showing up as your best self and so then , can you do the day ? 
 <h> The Future of Fundraising , What 's Next ? <p> The speed of technological change , the impact on individuals and the global community and what 's next in the world of fundraising is the focus of this article and the upcoming Pro Bono Australia webinar hosted by Dr Steve Francis from FrontStream AsiaPacific . <p> The Future of Fundraising , What 's Next ? Monday , 20th March 2017 at 12:30 pm <p> The speed of technological change , the impact on individuals and the global community and what 's next in the world of fundraising is the focus of this article and the upcoming Pro Bono Australia webinar hosted by Dr Steve Francis from FrontStream AsiaPacific . <p> Dr Francis is the managing director of FrontStream AsiaPacific and an expert in using technology to fundraise . With a PhD in Anthropology and more than 20 years experience in not for profits , he understands how to help charities optimise their fundraising through digital and online strategies . He will be hosting the 29 March webinar The Future of Fundraising , What 's Next ? Registration is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt your fundraising campaigns to changes in technology . <p> Society is constantly bombarded by stories of the latest in tech developments , via the most recent Ted Talk or through another hyperbolic Facebook post , that are meant to leave us excited about the possibilities for the future . While some people are clutching their credit card in anticipation of booking a ticket on a Space X sub-orbital flight , it 's likely that the less " flashy " tech developments will have the greatest impact on our everyday habits and work life . <p> Tech development is half the story , how quickly it 's picked up and absorbed by users is the real measure of how it will impact individuals , ways of work and the global community . Given this , what is the future of fundraising ? <p> Let 's do a quick overview of social media <p> It was n't long ago that social media was simple to use to engage your audience . Should we be surprised that such an enormous catchment of users is now a mish mash of news , cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rapid growth has turned into a massive tide of content that overwhelms , immerses and leaves us drunk on an ocean of opinion , arguments and conjecture . Twitter has more voyeurs than content makers . been " monetised " and Facebook has decreasing reach as greater weight is placed on paid boosts not to mention ever-changing " algorithms " . It can be a minefield , however we can only lean on what is proven . Content is king and audience segmentation and content personalisation is critical . It 's more work for the marketing team , but the fact is that making more personal and less generic content gets results . <p> More mobile <p> According to the Ericsson mobility report , smartphone subscriptions were at around 7.4 billion mid-2016 , and mobile users worldwide are predicted to increase by 20 per cent year-on-year , with a projection togrow to 6.1 billion by 2020 . In a nutshell , more and more people have access to mobile devices and are utilising more functionality . Furthermore , by 2018 , 33 per cent of the global population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion users . As more people use mobile apps and platforms , they become more savvy to the content being funnelled into each channel . <p> What about all the data ? <p> With renewed emphasis on collection , more than ever we need to look at our audience data . Analytics and data analysis is a skill now required of content marketers . Firstly , we need to collect as much detail as possible to drill down into segments then highly personalise the marketing material for each segment . It 's like creating 10 different pieces of content for each parallel world your donors live in ( pause for effect ) . However , piles of data are the digital advantage all content marketers have when creating impactful calls to action . <p> So , let 's look at tech futures <p> Mobile Wallet <p> Mobile Wallet technology has been floating around the past few years but the uptake has been slow . This is changing . Banks are getting behind new contactless payments . Point of sale merchandise promoting " touch and go " is noticeable as mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travel reservations . This could be a revolution for new donors to give when they want , wherever they are realising the dream of one touch donations . Statistics suggest that globally , 8 per cent have used a mobile wallet , in the United States , it is 18 per cent . <p> The Internet of Things <p> Currently mobile phones are the most multipurpose devices in the world , by 2018 this will be surpassed by the Internet of Things . Devices that fall into this category include cars , machinery , power utility meters , and consumer electronics such as fridges , air-conditioning , home security and some we do n't talk about ( I 'm looking at you , Google glass ) . <p> The Internet of Things could impact fundraising campaigns and optimisation . Consider this : the fridge is opened and it informs you that it 's time to buy milk , press here to order more milk and by the way how about matching that purchase with a donation to Care Australia to help feed a hungry child in Sudan . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for a future on the brink of wholly connected goods . <p> Virtual Reality <p> Virtual Reality ( VR ) offers a new wave of storytelling in campaigns , altering the experience for potential donors in a more impactful way than ever before . Some not for profits are investing in VR campaigns already and using them as part of their fundraising campaign mix . <p> Amnesty UK , UNICEF Canada , and a handful of international not for profits have created successful VR campaigns with great results and this is set to spread as access to cardboard VR devices costs as little as $10 . <p> The future of fundraising looks different to today 's landscape . Switched-on not for profit campaigners need to adapt creative solutions to the challenges ahead , considering audiences as well as tech , in the context of better fundraising . 
 <p> The study found that in the seven largest firms in Australia ( more than 450 lawyers ) , pro bono performance remained generally stable at an average of 39.4 hours . <p> " A key driver of this growth is the rising unmet legal need of asylum seekers , " the report said . <p> " In 2016 immigration ranked third in the list of areas of law in which the most pro bono work is done , moving up from 12th in 2014 . Forty per cent of firms in the survey listed immigration in their top five areas of pro bono practice , up from 15 per cent in 2014 , " it said . <p> In 2016 lawyers from large legal firms reached the voluntary national target ( of at least 35 hours ) for providing pro bono legal services for the first time in five years . <p> In every survey report since 2008 , family law and criminal law have been the areas where requests for pro bono assistance were most often rejected by large firms . The 2016 survey was no exception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration , debt and employment law , indicating " continuing unmet legal demand in these areas " . <p> CEO of the Australian Pro Bono ( Law ) Centre , John Corker said : " Despite this impressive growth , the performance across the 41 respondent firms is still strikingly uneven , ranging from four hours of pro bono work per lawyer a year , to 71 hours . <p> " There is clearly room for a much stronger effort at several firms , " he said . <p> " The survey allows firms to benchmark themselves against their peers and firms are encouraged to do so . " <p> However , he said there were indications in the report that further growth may be limited due to constraints on the capacity of large firms to take on more pro bono work . <p> As many as 83 per cent of firms cited " firm capacity " as one of the three biggest challenges facing their pro bono program , and over half said that their internal pro bono target was likely to remain the same in 2017 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " The centre has been working to help small to mid-sized firms to grow pro bono but each firm has its own capacity constraints . Additional growth prospects are most likely amongst those firms that do n't have particularly well developed pro bono practices . The centre has resources to assist these firms and we are working on strategies to achieve a more even spread of effort , " he said . <p> The report said direct requests from people or organisations seeking pro bono help remained the most common source of pro bono work for large firms , with 38 per cent of new matters arising this way . <p> However , the data also showed a growth in responses to requests from Community Legal Centres ( CLCs ) . In 2016 , overall large firms received 20 per cent of their pro bono matters from CLCs , with mid-size firms receiving up to 33 per cent of matters this way . <p> Chair of the Australian Pro Bono ( Law ) Centre , Phillip Cornwell said : " It is good to see CLCs taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are concerned at the impact of the forthcoming funding cuts to CLCs . <p> " There is neither capacity nor I think a willingness on the part of private law firms to bridge the massive gap that will open up if the funding cuts are not reversed , " Cornwell said . <p> " Further , many firms rely on partnering with legal assistance services such as CLCs to provide pro bono assistance . The funding cuts will not only reduce the capacity of CLCs to provide services they may also reduce the ability of law firms to do pro bono work . " <p> Earlier this month the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre ( ASRC ) raised $400,000 in just five days of a 14-day fundraising campaign to pay human rights lawyers to provide legal support for more than 1,000 asylum seekers in Australia . <p> The fundraising campaign called #KeepThemSafe sort to provide legal support for 1,150 people seeking asylum who the ASRC said were currently at risk . <p> The previous law centre survey in 2014 raised questions about where the balance should lie between pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corker said that encouragingly the 2016 survey results showed that the split has shifted from 65 per cent for organisations and 35 per cent for individuals in 2014 , to 56 per cent for organisations and 44 per cent for individuals in 2016 . <p> " As the pro bono ethos for lawyers stems from an ethical professional responsibility to improve access to justice , it is vital that law firms devote a significant part of their pro bono programs to directly helping individuals , " Corker said . 
 <h> NFPs Need to Be Aware of What Attracts ATO Attention <p> Not-for-profit organisations have to comply with a wide range of laws including tax laws and it is prudent to be aware of any red flag issues the Australian Tax Office may raise from time to time , writes Terry Hayes , senior tax analyst at Thomson Reuters , who offers his top ATO " alerts " . <p> Not-for-profit organisations have to comply with a wide range of laws including tax laws and it is prudent to be aware of any red flag issues the Australian Tax Office may raise from time to time , writes Terry Hayes , senior tax analyst at Thomson Reuters , who offers his top ATO " alerts " . <p> Like many entities , not-for-profit organisations such as charities and other funds are required to comply with many laws , including tax and super laws . They may be entitled to tax concessions but of course there are conditions and rules attached to that . <p> It is important to note that , regardless of whether an organisation is eligible for tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , for example , obligations for GST , FBT and PAYG withholding . If an NFP has an Australian business number ( ABN ) , it can use that to register for GST and claim GST credits , register for pay as you go ( PAYG ) withholding , and apply to the ATO for endorsement as a deductible gift recipient or tax concession charity . <p> The ATO uses various sources of information and undertakes a range of compliance activities to detect and deal with NFP organisations that do not fulfil their tax and super obligations . <p> There are certain behaviours and activities that alert the ATO to possible abuse of the tax and super systems . <p> For private ancillary funds , these issues concern : <p> late lodgement of annual return ( this really is a " compliance 101 " issue , but failing to lodge a return on time really gets an organisation offside with the regulators ) <p> related party transactions <p> non-compliance with the regulatory guidelines . <p> For charities and deductible gift recipients ( DGRs ) , issues to watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose for which the organisation is established , for example , private benefits to individual . There have been a number of cases on this issue over the years but , broadly , the purpose of an organisation is determined having regard to its constituent documents and activities in particular . Charitable purposes can include : advancing health , advancing social or public welfare , advancing education , advancing religion . <p> Making incorrect claims for franking credit refunds . To be eligible for a refund of franking credits , a not-for-profit organisation must have an ABN , be a resident and be at least one of the following : a registered charity endorsed by the ATO to access income tax exemption , endorsed by the ATO as a DGR in its own right , or specifically named as a DGR in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 . <p> Incorrectly advertising that donations to an organisation are tax deductible when the organisation is not endorsed as a deductible gift recipient . Organisations apply to the ATO for this endorsement and there are specific rules in the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be established and operated in Australia . <p> Business-like activities can be compatible with a charitable purpose . Charitable status can be maintained for example provided the organisation 's sole purpose is charitable and it carries on a business or commercial endeavour to give effect to that charitable purpose . In these circumstances , it does not matter that the commercial activities themselves are not intrinsically charitable . Of course , each case is different and clarification with the ATO should be sought if there is any doubt . <p> For self-assessing income tax exempt not-for-profit organisations that are not charities ( eg community service organisations , health organisations , educational organisations , sporting organisations ) , the ATO has flagged issues such as : <p> Incorrectly self-assessing income tax exempt status . <p> Not meeting the requirements of an exempt category . The law here can get a little complex , but for a community service organisation to be exempt , it must be established for community service purposes ( eg associations of playgroups , traditional service clubs such as Apex , Lions , Rotary and the like ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Australia . <p> For taxable not-for-profit entities ( eg social clubs ) , the ATO has concerns around incorrect classification of member and non-member income and expenses which may result in an understatement of assessable income . <p> On the FBT front generally , the ATO is on the lookout for incorrect claims for FBT rebates and exemptions that do n't meet the requirements of the law . Organisations that qualify for the FBT rebate include : charities that are institutions , certain scientific or public educational institutions , trade unions and employer associations , NFP organisations established to encourage music , art , literature or science . <p> The ATO properly notes that having good governance practices in place helps NFP organisations identify and manage their tax and superannuation compliance risks and other risks that may impact on their reputation and their work . <p> NFP organisations have to comply with a wide range of laws , and tax laws are only one of them . However , complying with the tax and superannuation laws is not always straightforward .

 <p> According to the researchers , Adjunct Professor Sandra Diminic and Professor Harvey Whiteford from the University of Queensland and Professor Peter Brooks from the University of Melbourne , the informal hours of care are equivalent to the direct support-work of nearly 180,000 full-time mental health workers per year . <p> " Were this care not provided informally , our report found national and state governments would need to fork out an estimated $13.2 billion to provide the same level of support in the mental health service sector , " the researchers said . <p> Lead researcher , told Pro Bono News that the finding was " certainly surprising " given that the cost of a " hidden mental health workforce " was more than the cost of all mental health services in Australia . <p> " We have heard from many carers working in mental health about their own experiences and they say they are doing a lot of care but this is the first time that we have actually been able to quantify what that actually looks like , " said . <p> " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was compare mental health carers with carers for people with other disability types and people who care for other cognitive or behavioural conditions like dementia and traumatic brain injuries and people with other physical and sensory disabilities . <p> " When we looked at the profile of the types of care they do and the way they spend those hours of caring , mental health carers were more likely to do emotional support work . <p> " This is compared to only 20 per cent of physical health carers . Yet fewer mental health carers assist their care recipient with practical tasks and activities of daily living . " <p> The report said that in 2015 there were about 240,000 informal mental health carers in Australia . The majority of them were female and most were of working age . <p> " But a concerning 15 per cent were young people under 25 , some as young as eight years old . Even more concerning is the significant mental health impact on these carers themselves , particularly those in the developmental stages , " the researchers said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , such as psychosis , often need assistance to live and function in the community . Some may need support to manage practical tasks such as shopping , cooking and managing their medication schedule . " Around 68 per cent of mental health carers report that they provide emotional support and encouragement to manage crises . On average , these tasks account for two-thirds of the time they spend providing care . " <p> The researchers said mental health carers also faced challenges in accessing services to support their caring role . <p> " The report tells us roughly $1.2 billion was spent on these services in 2015 , mostly on income support payments . But only 24 per cent of primary mental health carers receive carer payments ; only 34 per cent receive any assistance in their caring role ; and a concerning 35 per cent do not know what services are available to support them , " they said . <p> said : " The report found mental health carers usually provide support to a partner or child , who most frequently have common mental illnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one other health condition , particularly drug and alcohol problems or physical health conditions . <p> " The message coming from the carers is that they are doing a lot and they do need to be supported to ensure that they continue to do that and their own mental and physical health does n't suffer as well . " <p> The researchers said the findings had important implications for the current review of assessment processes for receiving the carer payment and carer allowance which include : <p> Eligibility for the carer payment is partially determined by completion of the Adult Disability Assessment Tool . This is designed for all types of disability and may not adequately capture the different types of care provided by mental health carers . <p> The National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) is ramping up to provide targeted support and better coordination and access to services for people with disabilities , including those with mental illness . The NDIS may reduce the burden on carers by improving mental health care coordination , but it is important services to support the vital role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . <p> While the health workforce in Australia is now the largest employment sector , it gives very little recognition to carers . Yet without them the mental health system would be even more stretched than it is . <p> The gap between supply and demand for all carers , including mental health carers , will likely widen significantly over the next few decades . Carers are to a large extent the " hidden workforce " in the Australian health system and this report sends a clear message . <p> " We need to recognise , appropriately train and support these mental health carers . We also need to ensure health professionals include them as vital members of the health care team , " the researchers said . <h> One Comment <p> And we need to stop creating more mental illness by criminalising drug use , and by fracturing families who need whole-of-family support . Taking children from their families does not work . In the case of our family it led to three more people becoming mentally i 'll , and requiring care , which I have provided for 48 years . 
 <h> Disability Groups Renew Call for Abuse Royal Commission <p> Disability groups have renewed their call for a royal commission into violence against people with disability after the office of the NSW Ombudsman confirmed it had begun an inquiry into the operations of not-for-profit organisation Lifestyle Solutions . <p> Disability groups have renewed their call for a royal commission into violence against people with disability after the office of the NSW Ombudsman confirmed it had begun an inquiry into the operations of not-for-profit organisation Lifestyle Solutions . <p> Claims by ABC Four Corners report , Fighting the System , on Monday night revealed evidence of the violence and abuse against people with disability in Australia and the centre that provides group housing for people with disabilities . <p> Disabled People 's Organisations Australia ( DPO Australia ) , described the report as " only the tip of the iceberg " . <p> " More evidence has come to light that supports the case for a royal commission . It is only a royal commission that has the weight , the investigative powers , the time and resources to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments , and expose Australia 's shameful secret , " the director of DPO Australia Therese Sands said . <p> " People with disability are routinely denied access to justice , both at a civil and criminal level because of law , policy and practice barriers . A royal commission would give space and recognition to people with disability to tell their story , to be believed , and would enable some measure of accountability and justice . " <p> The Office of the NSW Ombudsman has confirmed to Pro Bono News that it is investigating the operations of the disability support organisation Lifestyle Solutions after receiving a number of complaints from parents and former staff . <p> The deputy NSW ombudsman Steve Kinmond told the ABC : " These were people with significant health challenges . They needed to have thorough health assessments ... I could give a lengthy explanation but let me put it simply . The practice was unacceptable . <p> " We saw enough evidence of significant matters that should not have taken place . To draw a line in the sand and to say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solutions . " <p> The 2015 Senate Committee Inquiry into violence and abuse against people with disability in institutional and residential settings found that violence and abuse was prolific and hidden . The central recommendation of the committee was the establishment of a royal commission . <p> The federal government ruled out a royal commission in its response to the Senate inquiry earlier this month . The government said that it was addressing violence and abuse against people with disability by establishing the Quality and Safeguarding Framework for the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) . <p> Dr Jessica Cadwallader , violence prevention manager at People with Disability Australia , a member of DPO Australia said : " While the Quality and Safeguarding Framework is welcome and very important , it will not protect all people with disability , only those who are NDIS eligible . It appears to be largely based on systems and responses that the Senate Inquiry found to be inadequate . <p> " A royal commission has a critical role to play as Australia undertakes national changes to disability supports and services . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disability , its many forms and the broad range of services and settings where it occurs . <p> " It would have the resources to examine the adequacy of systems , processes and accountability mechanisms designed to put an end to the appalling rates of violence and abuse against people with disability . " <p> The federal opposition said it was deeply concerned by the violence inflicted on people with disability revealed on ABC 's Four Corners program . <p> " It is totally unacceptable that incidents of sexual and physical abuse have occurred and that perpetrators may still be working in the disability sector , " the shadow minister for social services , Jenny Macklin said . <p> " The evidence of abuse of vulnerable people with disability should shame us all . " <p> A statement from Lifestyle Solutions newly appointed CEO Andrew Hyland said : " We are deeply saddened by these matters and realise the impact on families and other people we support . <p> " The majority of matters have been the subject of extensive reviews by relevant regulatory bodies . Where shortcomings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procedures . Some of the matters referred to remain the subject of regulatory review and it would therefore be inappropriate to speculate on findings . <p> " I was appointed as the new chief executive of Lifestyle Solutions in November last year . Five of our seven directors were appointed from October 2014 , including Mrs Karen Woodford a former chief investigator with the Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate of the NSW Department of Education . <p> " As an organisation , we continuously review and implement advancements to strengthen our policies , procedures and management frameworks to deliver the best services possible .

 <p> Changing Democracy From the Ground , 29th March 2017 at 8:20 am <p> An online platform is working to bridge the gap between government and people passionate about the issues that politicians get to make decisions about . <p> Matthew Gordon , chief of operations and one of the founders of OurSay , came up with the concept at the Centre for Sustainability Leadership , a typical leadership program full of young , emerging leaders from all walks of life . <p> Gordon 's story begins eight years ago : " We were hearing from the former state minister for the environment and he asked the question of the 25 emerging leaders : ' How many of you are a member of a political party ? ' and zero hands go up , so he goes : ' Well how many of you aspire to be a politician ? ' and again zero hands go up , and then he asks : ' Well , ok , ' and he 's a bit embarrassed at this point , ' How many of you would like to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? ' and of course all hands go up at this point . <p> " The places where decisions are being made , particularly in government , and the places where people are connecting to and are passionate about issues are two different places . " <p> Gordon and his co-founder CEO Eyal Halamish set out to bridge this gap . <p> " We decided to get together and develop a place where leaders and members of the community can come together around decision making , " Gordon says . <p> He describes OurSay as a 21st century platform for democracy . <p> " It has a range of discussion forum tools which allow leaders in government to share questions or issues that they would like to collectively resolve with the community , " he says . <p> " And it allows the community to register ideas , share those ideas on social media , and then vote on and prioritise what one they would like to see actioned . And it allows leaders to then respond to those priorities . " <p> The self-service platform helps local , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote them to their target audience . <p> took off quickly , and in 2012 , three years after launching , Gordon and Halamish quit their jobs to focus on the social enterprise full time . <p> " We just got so busy with requests to do projects that there was just not enough time after work to do it , " Gordon says . <p> " So that 's kind of an indication of what happened immediately . The response is that it just took off . <p> " And since then we 've been growing pretty steadily . We now have 10 staff and we 've serviced 60 to 70 governments around the country , and other organisations including water authorities , community banking , universities , media , and we 've reached over two million Australians and we 've had over 100,000 Australians make a submission in that time . " <p> He says their " breakthrough " was using to help local governments to engage their constituents . <p> " It 's not flash , but what we realised was that decisions made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> " In particular around quality of life areas , like at the end of the day local governments are responsible for making sure rubbish goes away , making sure the roads are adequately serviced , make sure there 's local community-based health organisations , making sure older people are looked after ... through aged care services . It 's kind of a cradle to grave level of government . <p> " In 2013 we ran a project with one of the smallest local governments you could find , Hepburn Shire , and it was the first time that we ran a project where the top 10 ideas , no matter what they were , directly , almost unfiltered , informed a government plan . " <p> experienced an unprecedented level of engagement on the Hepburn project . <p> " We had more than 10 per cent of the community engaged in this plan , which is a thousand times more than you expect , so lots and lots of people , " Gordon says . <p> " And what happened was when they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to prioritise for the next four years . <p> " When they measured the community satisfaction and the quality of the decision making , it skyrocketed , it jumped by 20 to 30 per cent in that period of time . <p> " What it shows is that good governance is as much about good engagement as it is making good decisions . In fact , good governance is about making decisions with good engagement . And from then on , we 've just gone ok let 's scale out local government , and I think we 've worked with about 50 local governments . " <p> Despite its growth , Gordon says one of the first and biggest challenges for OurSay was securing government grants . <p> " The OurSay model was seen to be risky , it was about driving the accountability and transparency back at government and funding bodies in government or even outside of government did n't want to touch that , " he says . <p> " So we established ourselves , and using this B Corp accreditation process , to build a for-profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to also secure funding from private investors that have a social orientation with their investment fund . " <p> " So one of the things that we found working through a social enterprise was the funding issue , and how do you get the balance right between private equity and public good . That was the main challenge . " <p> has since experimented with several different funding models , including a sponsorship model , before finding the right one . <p> " Then we realised ... governments need to engage with their community anyway , they 're already spending money in this space , why do n't they spend a little bit on this , and maybe we can show them that they can get a better result , which we have , " Gordon says . <p> " And so now we are strictly providing on a subscription-only basis to these public institutions . " <p> Gordon says the other challenge was keeping staff morale up and " being able to build a team of people committed to something without seeing any immediate return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights burning the whole time is always a challenge . <p> " Over the last three or four years though Eyal and I have worked very closely together and we feel that we 're in this together now and it 's not going to go away and we 're highly committed to keep driving it . <p> " My only advice to anyone who 's a budding young social entrepreneur : do n't do it alone . " <p> With the business well established , Gordon is hoping to broaden its social impact by using revenue from governments to support the not-for-profit sector . <p> " We think there 's an interesting opportunity to work with NGOs and the broader third sector to help them engage communities , and to help them raise money for their projects through the OurSay process as well , " he says . <p> " And so this is a little bit under wraps but the idea is we can actually develop an economy for democracy where NGOs and the third sector can not only engage communities through our technology , but also raise money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole process . " <p> Gordon and Halamish are also looking to expand the model overseas . <p> " Australia 's been a really good place to prove the model and to show that it can have a wide application across different types of projects , " Gordon says . <p> " We 're now really interested in looking at growing our market to the United States , and potentially the UK and Europe . <p> " After the Trump election we got two or three organic phone calls from US congressmen in rust belt states going : ' We need a new strategy for engagement , that needs to be bottom up . ' " <p> He says every year OurSay is becoming more and more relevant . <p> " We 're seeing a radicalist political movement grow because of a deep dissatisfaction with the functional institutions of our democracy , and they 're getting no more better exemplified than Trump ascendancy , " he says . <p> " And so we think it 's more important than ever to be using these sorts of technologies and approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the highest level , increase trust in the institutions that are charged with delivering outcomes for the community , and targeting our focus around the institutions and organisations that require a heightened social licence to operate . <p> " But to do that requires awesome engagement that makes people feel that they 're being heard , that their voices are being valued and understood by their political leaders , and our goal is to continue driving that as hard as we can . " 
 <p> Australia has a lot to learn from the UK experience of transferring public housing estates to not-for-profit providers , according to new research . <p> A new study has painted a picture of the UK experience over three decades , offering information about how similar transactions in Australia could maximise their potential long-term benefits and best support not-for-profit housing sector growth . <p> According to the research , undertaken for by RMIT University and the University of Glasgow , the UK property transfers created NFP housing providers that were " dynamic and resilient " in the face of economic and social changes . <p> Professor Duncan Maclennan from RMIT University , one of the research authors , told Pro Bono News public housing was " stuck " at the moment in Australia and needed to change . <p> " Although public housing in Australia has never housed more than 6 per cent of the population and is now down to about 4 per cent , it 's been a really important source of housing to low income people and sometimes people recently arrived in the country , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it has run down in scale , it is run down in quality , it 's regarded as problematic and very often only the poorest and more marginal households will live in there , so it is fairly stuck in a sense in terms of its quality and where it 's going . <p> " Many big authorities in the UK were in a similar position at the start of the 1990s and decided that they would transfer their housing , when it was approved by their tenants I may say their tenants had to be asked in this process to non profit ownership because they had access to money that was n't government money , they used private finance , they were able to change , they were able to form partnerships to renew neighbourhoods in a way that sometimes public authorities find it difficult to work across different departments . <p> " The office of housing in Australian states has n't always found it easy to work with other departments around about it to do the things you need to do to change your neighbourhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for the Australian experience , where things still have to change , and affordable housing has to somehow make some progress , to actually look at the UK experience ... The UK does n't do everything well , as we know at present , but in the instance of public housing transfers I think the experience has been overwhelmingly positive and given us a much better housing system . " <p> In particular the researchers found that a supportive national policy regime from 1989 to 2010 was a crucial ingredient of UK success . <p> Key components of this framework included a bond aggregator , coherent regulation , and links between not-for-profit providers and private funders . <p> Maclennan said tenant participation was also critical to the success of the UK experience . <p> " The requirement that proposed transfers could proceed only when backed by a tenant ballot had a key role in giving NFP ' successor landlords ' community legitimacy and a mandate for clearly defined change , " he said . <p> " The main takeaways for Australia at different levels would be , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent approach to regulation of not for profits across the different states . <p> " I think it is important for the federal government to promote good intermediaries between small not-for-profit providers seeking finance and the capital markets and they 've recently introduced the idea of putting a bond aggregator in place to facilitate that . So the federal government are taking these responsibilities clearly . <p> " At the state level , I think that state politicians , state treasuries and state housing departments have to make an honest assessment of whether they have really got the money or are prepared to make the money available to invest in improving the social housing that is there and in many instances think about alternatives through not for profit ownership . <p> " I think a number of states , I think Queensland and more recently Victoria have taken a step back from that and I think that unless they can really demonstrate how they 're going to make that housing better , then I think they should think again ... I think that political ideology rather than really good outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefront of a lot of decision taking and I think that 's unfortunate . " <p> The study established that in working to transform run-down public housing systems , different capacities needed to be developed at different stages , both in housing providers and in government bureaucracies . <p> The stages include : during the initial policy planning process , after transfer , in a " " post-transfer period ( two to five years ) , a consolidation period of up to a decade , and as a mature provider often involving significant changes in roles , staffing , resources and governance . <p> " In the UK , property transfers diversified the affordable housing sector , created new routes to private finance , and allowed not-for-profits to grow to an efficient scale . They were also important in shaping a flexible innovative housing association sector , " Maclennan said . <p> " But in recent years UK governments have largely abandoned property transfer policies , and housing associations in England have had to cope with ad hoc policy interventions that have changed their not-for-profit status and presented major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairing chief executive of a property transfer housing association formed by central government in 2015 that , within a year of starting , was facing new sitting tenant sales obligations , rent caps and a weakening of tenants ' rent-paying capacity due to benefit cuts . In combination , these changes posed a serious threat to the organisation 's financial viability . " <p> Maclennan said transferring public housing estates to not-for-profit providers was something Australia should be considering . <p> " I think the general idea of trying to raise the amount of nonpublic money that goes into delivering affordable housing is something that needs to come into play here because there is a deathly shortage of affordable housing and the government is not making the money available , so creating a route to private money that 's still affordable is important , " he said . <p> " I think the second reason that there is a space is that not for profits do n't just provide housing for the poorest people , they will quite often provide housing outcomes . <p> " Say for housing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing for young people who do n't have enough to get into home ownership , or even main market renting , so that they 've been able to become somewhat more flexible local housing agents who are dealing with a number of the housing problems that there are in housing systems , and I think that given the general crisis for housing affordability and not just the problems of so-called affordable housing , I think Australia have to look at different institutions that actually will address different parts of that spectrum if you like , of affordability difficulty . <p> " And I think not for profits can do that in a way that public sector bodies ca n't , and I think if there was a political willingness to actually address what needs to be done , there would be a real capacity to do quite a bit . " <p> He said the UK experience had shown not-for-profit organisations were effective in this space . <p> " Very few of these non-profits run into any kind of difficulty of either being well managed and they have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been effective , they 've been honest but also they 've done an awful lot more that they were expected to do , " he said . <p> " In other words , the not-for-profit sector used the housing assets in creative ways that governments rarely think of . " <p> He said the proof was in the response of the staff . <p> " Where the staff who came to run the public housing units that were transferred , those that had previously worked for the public authority , how they put it was , in the past they 'd reported upwards in the political system , what they now did was they reported to the local tenants or the community who were in the housing , that was who they worked for now rather than the bureaucracy , " he said . <p> " That had a really telling effect on their relationships . <p> " They also brought on boards of a non-political nature that were capable of taking long term decisions about rent and maintenance that seem to have been beyond public housing authorities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the feedback from the staff in the organisations . And by and large any staff and tenant satisfaction studies that emerged out of the process and over the longer term have shown a significant improvement in how people felt about what they were doing , in the same territories if you like , mark you , they managed to access more investment funds , so that always makes people happier .

 <h> Sticking to Our Knitting <p> Minister Dutton and the Parliamentary Inquiry into the Register of Environmental Organisations have done civil society a service by encouraging us to think about our purpose and our knitting and the need to gather up more balls of wool and knit one , purl one , argues CEO of Community Council for Australia David Crosbie . <p> Minister Dutton and the Parliamentary Inquiry into the Register of Environmental Organisations have done civil society a service by encouraging us to think about our purpose and our knitting and the need to gather up more balls of wool and knit one , purl one , argues CEO of Community Council for Australia David Crosbie . <p> The Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton suggested CEOs of large companies should " stick to their knitting " , and not bully the government by expressing views on political matters like marriage equality . He also suggested the CEOs should stand for political office if they wanted to express political views , and not use the public profile of their companies to promote individual views . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a government committed to free speech and liberty ( the basis of liberalism ) it was a rather surprising attempt to dismiss the views of some influential Australians . Regardless of the merit of arguments for and against marriage equality , or other policy issues , the suggestion that CEOs of major companies expressing their views can be seen as inappropriate bullying of government has implications for the charity sector . <p> Many in government believe the " stick to your knitting " approach should be more broadly applied across the charities sector . These views within government are reflected in the findings of the inquiry into the charitable status of environmental organisations released in May last year : <p> The committee recommends that legislative and administrative changes be pursued by the Australian Taxation Office to require that the value of each environmental deductible gift recipient 's annual expenditure on environmental remediation work be no less than 25 per cent of the organisation 's annual expenditure from its public fund . <p> This inquiry believes " knitting " for environmental organisations is remediation work and all environmental charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring at least 25 per cent of expenditure to be in a specified area of activity is not only inconsistent with the legal definition of charity , it also confuses activities with purpose . <p> Not that long ago , CCA , along with many other organisations across the charities sector , advocated strongly to ensure protections for advocacy were written into the Charities Act 2013 so that the sole charitable purpose can include : " promoting or opposing a change to any matter established by law , policy or practice in the Commonwealth , a state , a territory or another country . " <p> The explanatory notes included as part of the charities act refer specifically to the 2010 High Court judgement in relation to the case . For those unfamiliar with this case here is one of the most important statements from the High Court judgement : <p> It could scarcely be denied , these days , that it may be necessary for organisations , whose purposes are directed to the relief of poverty or the advancement of education to agitate for change in the policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their charitable purposes . No-one would suggest that charitable and political purposes are mutually exclusive . A charitable institution may have charitable and political purposes , provided that the political purpose is not the main or predominant purpose of the organisation . <p> incorporated v Commissioner of taxation of the commonwealth of Australia ( 2010 ) <p> The law could not be clearer . Advocacy for policy change is a legitimate charitable endeavour or activity provided it is in support of the charitable purpose . Charities can take a political stance . While they can not campaign for a particular candidate with how-to-vote cards , or stand candidates themselves to try to obtain political office , all charities have the legal right to advocate for policies , to publicly say the policy of a particular political party is not good for the communities they serve . <p> I would go one step further . I think in many circumstances charities have an obligation to their charitable purpose that requires advocacy . <p> Imagine an environmental charity that knows a large company is continuously poisoning local waterways and chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be failing to adequately pursue its charitable purpose . A charity committed to protecting and enhancing our environment would have an obligation to seek to change the regulations and practices that lead to the poisons being in the waterways in the first place . <p> My experience is that charities are often at their best when driving sustainable changes to improve the lives of people in the communities they serve . Charities drove the introduction of random breath testing and standard drink labelling that have now indisputably saved thousands of lives . What if the charities involved in this advocacy had been content to treat the injured and help bury the dead ? <p> Charities that lift their sights and try to reduce and prevent harm in our communities deserve commendation , not condemnation . <p> For many businesses , their knitting may primarily be about delivering dividends and capital gains to owners and shareholders , but that is no longer the whole story . Increasingly , businesses are talking about their values and what value they provide their communities . <p> For many charities across Australia , advocacy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to live in , we might all need to gather more balls of wool and get stuck in . <p> About the author : David Crosbie is CEO of the Community Council for Australia .

 <h> Resilience in Rural Australia is Becoming a Core Competency <p> As Queensland looks to its recovery from Cyclone Debbie it 's timely to reflect on resilience , the challenges for communities and the need to develop a skillset that promotes greater collaboration and capacity building , writes Natalie Egleton CEO of Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal ( FRRR ) . <p> Resilience in Rural Australia is Becoming a Core , 30th March 2017 at 8:25 am <p> As Queensland looks to its recovery from Cyclone Debbie it 's timely to reflect on resilience , the challenges for communities and the need to develop a skillset that promotes greater collaboration and capacity building , writes Natalie Egleton CEO of Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal ( FRRR ) . <p> It may sound like a clich ? , but it 's never been more true : we are living in turbulent times . <p> And it does n't matter where you live -- city or country people are having to do things and respond to things that they perhaps never imagined . Natural disasters seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; commodity prices go up and down almost overnight ; technology evolves so quickly and businesses seem to be opening and closing at a rapid rate . Each of these things and plenty more -- present challenges for communities and local leaders . <p> This means we need to develop a different skillset that promotes greater collaboration , adaptation and capacity building and we need to be resilient . Fortunately , for many rural , regional and remote communities , these skills are already prevalent . <p> So what is resilience and how do you cultivate it ? Resilience is the ability to absorb a shock or setback and flourish in spite of change or maybe even because of it . There are lots of definitions but I describe a resilient community as one that remains creative and adapts to the dynamic conditions , retains its identity and social connectedness , even if it 's hit by an industry crisis or natural disaster . <p> The need for rural , regional , remote communities to become self-sufficient is increasing and more than ever , communities need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flexible . The question is how ? <p> Innovation and collaboration with a local lens <p> A whole range of ingredients go into making a community resilient . There is " no one size fits all " and at FRRR , we firmly locals know the best local solution for their local problems . Sometimes it 's a case of coming together to lay out the problem , explore the options and listen to the ideas people have to solve the challenges . <p> That 's what happened in Felton , in Queensland , when they were confronted in 2008 with the prospect of an open cut coalmine and petrochemical plant being built on their land . The odds were n't in their favour no community had ever stopped a coalmine proceeding in Queensland but four and half years later , the Friends of Felton community group secured their future . <p> As a community , they wanted to showcase their local agriculture and encourage visitors to the area . The Felton Food Festival was formed and the town of 250 people now hosts more than 7,000 visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the farmers . The festival coordinator believes their most remarkable achievement is that Felton is now on the map , with people from across Australia attending the Festival . That 's a great example of rural resilience . <p> Work together to divide and conquer <p> Staying resilient requires a strong local leadership base that 's prepared to work together . This may mean local leaders need to shake off old competitive ways of working and harness their skills for the greater good of the community . <p> But as things change , you need new skills . And as new people come into the community , they bring different skills , which means the community can do different things . At FRRR , we encourage community groups to do a skills audit . Find out who 's good at public speaking , grant writing , project plan development , or who 's better at cooking and good old muscle power . By doing this , you have a skill bank you can draw on , but can also identify the areas where there are gaps . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas such as community leadership or social enterprise development . <p> Following the closure of several local businesses around 1997 , the Cummins and District Enterprise Committee ( CDEC ) , in rural South Australia , was formed with a remit to help stabilise the community and prevent losing further services and employment opportunities , and if possible , to develop new reasons for people to come to town . The group organised community events to revitalise Cummins , such as the Kalamazoo Races which were highly successful , but once they were n't as effective , led to the creation of an air show and more recently a monster , community-wide garage sale that attracts hundreds of visitors and creates opportunities for local businesses and for fundraising by community groups . <p> The CDEC has also been involved in improving child care services and the caravan park for the town . Taking care of the " big stuff " allowed local groups and business owners to facilitate their own fundraising and business ideas . The town is justifiably proud of its achievements and continues to work together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social , supportive and well-resourced town is a happy town . If people socialise locally and support local businesses , the town usually has strong morale and will be more resilient when faced with tough times . <p> My own home-town of Maldon in Victoria is one such community . A review of the Essential Economics report from 2011 , commissioned by the local council , showed that the number of vacant retail outlets in Maldon was increasing and the level of visitor and local spending was decreasing . The Maldon Neighbourhood Centre is a progressive team and on hearing the findings , they wanted to take action to reverse this trend . <p> They identified two significant gaps in Maldon 's retail offering -- fresh fruit and vegetables and " ' speciality " shops . So the idea of a monthly market , utilising the local talent , was developed to fill this gap . <p> The initial aim was to attract 500 people a month to the market . Now an average of 1,200 people turn up each month . The benefits of the market have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community morale has never been stronger . <p> There are lessons from all these communities for all of us . These inspiring local leaders are wonderful role models , and all happy to share their stories with anyone who wants to know more about how they did it . <p> Philanthropy has a key role in building resilience <p> Rural communities need to develop a different skillset that promotes greater collaboration , adaptation and capacity building . I encourage all rural and regional communities to think creatively , use different skillsets , invest in future generations and work together to develop ideas for the long-term gain . <p> Philanthropy has an important role to play in supporting local leaders to implement these creative solutions . It will come as no surprise that the reason I know about these stories is because each of these communities has been supported by a grant through FRRR , thanks to funding from our donor partners . <p> Vehicles like community philanthropy provide an opportunity for local people to lead projects and bring resources from within the community , and outside , dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local government to deliver strategic items to generate economic stimulus , through events and developing local leadership capacity . <p> While resilience may seem to be a bit of a buzz-word , it is an essential ingredient for sustainable rural communities . It may also seem complex or intangible , but the examples shared here show that if you love where you live and are prepared to work to improve things , anything is possible . <p> About the author : Natalie Egleton was appointed CEO of FRRR in November 2015 , after joining the organisation in 2012 and is responsible for shaping its strategy , designing new programs and developing and nurturing new funding partnerships .

 <h> Not-for-Profit Sector and the EU-Australia Relationship <p> The EU-Australia relationship is not just about trade but the big issues impacting our world , and it 's crucial that a range of voices are heard , including those from the not-for-profit sector , writes international affairs expert Melissa Conley Tyler . <p> Not-for-Profit Sector and the EU-Australia , 30th March 2017 at 8:11 am <p> The EU-Australia relationship is not just about trade but the big issues impacting our world , and it 's crucial that a range of voices are heard , including those from the not-for-profit sector , writes international affairs expert Melissa Conley Tyler . <p> " The European Union ? Is n't that about trade ? It does n't seem relevant to my work . " If this is your reaction when someone brings up the EU-Australia relationship , you 're not alone . <p> If the EU is mentioned in politics or the media , it is generally in terms of business or high foreign politics , not the bread and butter issues that matter to so many of us working in the not-for-profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a much deeper relationship . In many areas this is already happening . For example , the EU is the second biggest donor in the Pacific , after Australia . The Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently manage or are planning joint programs in Sudan , Fiji and Laos . The EU and Australia work together in international organisations to bring about the abolition of the death penalty . We co-operate across a range of environmental issues such as whaling , trade in endangered species , and the reduction of ozone-depleting substances . More than 1,000 of our young people have participated in university exchanges . There are countless areas to collaborate more . <p> This is the goal of the EU-Australia Leadership Forum , a three-year project funded by the European Union to provide a forum for people from business , government , not for profits , academia and the media to come together to discuss what should be on the agenda of the future EU-Australia relationship . For example , just this week , we are bringing together experts from the EU and Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery of development assistance . <p> World Vision Australia , StartSomeGood and WhyDev will meet with European counterparts to share their learnings about how digital tools can be used to reach development goals and also how the digital age changes the way we think about and deliver development assistance . <p> Recommendations from that workshop will go forward to a Senior Leaders ' Forum in June , when distinguished invitees will come together to tackle the big issues that are shaking up our world such as cybersecurity , radicalisation , migration and increasing economic interdependence . <p> If these discussions , and others that take place over the life of the project , are to be relevant and actionable , it is crucial that a range of voices are heard , including those from the not-for-profit sector . <p> We are very lucky to have some key figures supporting the project , such as Tim Costello of World Vision Australia and Luis Alvarado Martinez , president of the European Youth Forum . We are determined to have a strong not-for-profit contingent at both the Senior Leaders ' Forum and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond June 's events , there will be other opportunities for those working in the not-for-profit sector to make your voices heard . If you want to be part of these discussions , I 'd encourage you to sign up to our the EU-Australia Leadership Forum newsletter , and engage with us via our social media channels . <p> As Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said at the launch of the EU-Australia Leadership Forum last September , the EU and Australia have much in common . We share common values , a liberal democratic heritage , a commitment to freedoms , and a commitment to the rule of law . We also have in common strong , opinionated and valued not-for-profit sectors . <p> Your depth of expertise can bring much-needed context to many of the political and economic discussions that will take place between now and the start of negotiations on the future relationship between the European Union and Australia . <p> So what can you do ?

 <p> An interim royal commission report into youth detention in the Northern Territory says the current system is likely to leave its young inmates more damaged than when they entered . <p> The Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory Interim Report was released Friday . <p> Commissioners Margaret White AO and Mick Gooda said in the report : " The evidence presented to the commission so far reveals a youth detention system that is likely to leave many children and young people more damaged than when they entered . <p> " We have heard that the detention facilities are not fit for accommodating children and young people , and not fit for the purpose of rehabilitation . They are also unsuitable workplaces for youth justice of officers and other staff . <p> " They are harsh , bleak and not in keeping with modern standards . They are punitive , not rehabilitative . " <p> The report said the commission was continuing to take evidence on a range of practices within the detention centres , including the use of restraints , isolation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by detention centre staff . <p> " The evidence heard so far , however , raises serious concerns about inappropriate and unlawful practices , unacceptable standards of conduct and inappropriate methods of dealing with detainees within the youth detention centres , " the report said . <p> Source : ABC Four Corners <p> It also said that problems in the detention centres had been recognised within government before the broadcast of the ABC Four Corners program on the Don Dale detention centre that led to the establishment of the commission . <p> " The evidence before the commission clearly establishes that there is a significant over-representation of Aboriginal children and young people in both child protection and youth detention . This fact must influence the commission 's response to many of the issues under consideration , " the report said . <p> Chief executive Paul Ronalds said : " The initial findings of this landmark inquiry outlines the true extent of the problems in the Northern Territory youth justice system and shows the urgent need for reform . This must be a high priority for government . " Shocking accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the youth detention system is likely to leave young people more damaged than when they entered . Evidence showed the conditions are punitive , not rehabilitative . " Save the Children welcomes the commission 's statement that the well-being of the community is best achieved by a comprehensive approach to youth justice based on crime prevention , early intervention with children and young people at risk of offending , court diversion programs and community engagement . " <p> Ronalds said the harmful treatment of children in youth detention was not quarantined to the Northern Territory . <p> " Many parts of Australia are taking hardline , punitive approaches to youth justice , such as in Victoria . Not only do these put vulnerable children at risk of harm , they fail to make communities safer . Evidence shows that locking up children can increase the likelihood of them reoffending and getting trapped in a cycle of crime . " 
 <p> Mentoring the Next Generation of , 3rd April 2017 at 8:47 am <p> Charity leaders are being given an opportunity to develop their skills with a mentorship program that aims to increase staff retention across the sector . <p> Recruitment agency Beaumont Consulting will this week launch its second LEAD NFP mentorship program which aims to facilitate " the next generation of talent " and help foster relationships across the charity sector as a whole . <p> LEAD which stands for lead , empower , aspire and develop was designed to give charity leaders a chance to learn from peers within the industry to build leadership , communication and decision-making skills . <p> Beaumont Consulting not-for-profit manager Kate Larkin told Pro Bono News they wanted to enable charities to provide quality training opportunities for their upcoming leaders and encourage them to stay in the sector . <p> " We recruit everything from reception right through to CEO , executive and board level , and one of the key challenges that we see a lot of the charities having is their ability to attract , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Larkin said . <p> " While those leaders find their roles extremely rewarding , charities often lack the resources to fully develop and invest in strong , sustainable leadership capability . <p> " Our team has been set up as a non-profit generating arm of Beaumont Consulting so we actually recruit on a cost only model in terms of the fees that we charge and anything extra that we make we like to reinvest back into the sector . <p> " We saw there was a huge gap , where there was n't the sort of program offered to charity leaders to keep them in the sector . " <p> Beaumont launched the program last year offering 14 selected mentors and mentees the opportunity to complete the program at no financial cost . <p> Mentees from charities including St John Ambulance , Frontier Services , Benevolent Society , Cancer Council NSW , and Heart Research Australia were paired with mentors such as the CEOs of Cerebral Palsy Alliance , Camp Quality and Variety NSW . <p> Larkin said the initial interest far exceeded their expectations so they decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bigger scale . <p> " We were n't , to be honest with you , expecting as much interest as we got , " she said . <p> " Last year we could n't afford to offer it to more than one group because we use an external professional organisation to run it that was fully funded by Beaumont . <p> " So this year what we decide was we wanted to do it on a bigger scale so we 've crunched some numbers and worked out that if we charge just the mentees an annual fee of $499 , with the same level of funding that we put into it last year , we can afford to have three groups running this year , which means we can offer it to 36 people . <p> " The hope is over the years we can potentially get other organisations involved in terms of sponsorship and grow it further but right now at least we 've been able to triple in size after year two . " <p> LEAD NFP is run in conjunction with Leading Well Group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The 12-month program offers a mix of formal training , practical mentoring sessions and getting together with other members of the program to share experiences and learn from each other . <p> Larkin said the program was aimed at people who were already in leadership roles within charities . <p> " To be a mentee you must have at least 12 months experience within a leadership role and be currently working within a charity , " she said . <p> " We also stipulate in an ideal world that mentees not change their position voluntarily throughout the course of the program , because what we do n't want is people who are just using it as a way to network to move into another job . <p> " Then ... we want to see what their motivations are , what they 're looking for from their mentor , what they 're looking to achieve from the program , what their career aspirations are and then we have a look at people who have applied to be mentors and ... say well actually this person would be really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentors through a matching committee with senior representatives across the industry taking part in the process . <p> Larkin said the feedback from the first course revealed that both mentors and mentees had developed their leadership skills and grown their networks within the sector . <p> One mentor said : " I am far better with my own team . I have picked up some great techniques . The penny has dropped for me in the way that I deal with others . I am a better listener . I have realised a few things about myself and my leadership style . " <p> Vanessa Fudge from Leading Well Group said the program had been a " resounding success " . <p> " According to the mentors , the best parts were the networking and sharing experiences and success tips with other mentors during the quarterly meets , the training and the networking opportunity with other senior peers , and getting to help shape their mentees ' success , " Fudge said . <p> " Overall the feedback indicates that the participants have benefited greatly from their involvement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole . <p> " One of the main reasons you see people leave an organisation is they feel like they 're kind of stuck and that they 're not being developed , " she said . <p> " As a leader myself , I know , we would all love to be able to say ' I 've got all the time in the world to sit down with the talented people in my team and really talk through where they 're at with their career aspirations and what their looking to achieve and any issues they 're having , ' but we often get caught up in the day to day . <p> " What this does is , first of all for a charity to invest in sending a leader along to this , they 're telling them ' we value you as a person , and we think that time spent developing that , which is time away from your day to day job , is a worthwhile investment ' . <p> " From a growth perspective ... it 's the age old thing of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can develop the really strong leaders within charities ... that is only going to lead to higher retention across the organisation , as people will be working with really a inspiring leader .

 <h> Three Ways to Get Out of the NFP ' Digital Service Swamp ' <p> Digital strategist Richenda Vermeulen from ntegrity offers her top three tips to help you get out of the " digital service swamp " and on the road to driving real change in your not-for-profit organisation . <p> Digital strategist Richenda Vermeulen from ntegrity offers her top three tips to help you get out of the " digital service swamp " and on the road to driving real change in your not-for-profit organisation . <p> Do the following requests sound familiar to you ? <p> " Draft me an email . " <p> " I need five tweets , quick ! " <p> " We need a new Facebook page . " <p> " Change the copy on the website . " <p> If yes , it sounds as if your digital team is caught in the " digital service swamp " . They spend the bulk of their time responding to non-strategic , ad hoc requests from different departments , rather than implementing tactics and projects that align to achieving the strategic vision of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted Australian-first research into the digital confidence of 168 organisations , and found NFPs are struggling with this in particular . <p> " Digital " is typically siloed from the rest of the organisation and lacks priority or influence to create real impact . <p> Howard Ralley , CARE Australia 's executive of marketing , comms and fundraising sums up the " digital service swamp " in the ultimate analogy : " I think of the bit in Lord of the Rings when Frodo and Sam are walking to Mordor , and they get to a swamp . And they look down into the waters and they see all the dead people coming up I think those dead people are all the ex-digital people in my team who started the job thinking ' I can change the world through digital , ' and they ended up in the swamp . " <p> But the digital service swamp does n't just happen . Our data revealed that it 's actually an outworking of four common pitfalls in organisations today : <p> There 's no clear digital vision . <p> Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources are reactively rather than strategically allocated . <p> There 's not enough skilled staff or a low investment in digital training . <p> To save your team before they drown in the digital service swamp , our research showed us that you need to align the four components of digital success : leadership , vision , resources and skills . <p> Here are three ways you can begin to align these four key ingredients . <p> Understand your current state of digital <p> In many of the NFPs we work with , the digital team is fielding requests from the rest of the organisation -- everything from program delivery , marketing , fundraising , events , HR and finance -- meaning they 're responsible for more organisational prioritisation than any other team , but lack strategic impact . <p> They are also struggling to prove the ROI of digital against the tried and tested traditional channels like face-to-face and direct mail , because their digital resources keep being pulled in to reactive requests and are stuck in the " swamp " . <p> That 's why a great place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation ; equipping you with real data and insights to inform future change . <p> As a first step to understanding the state of digital , CARE Australia introduced a ticketing system to measure ad hoc requests -- just using a free Google form . In their first month they discovered they had 237 requests to " do stuff " . They have since been able to use this data to show the rest of the organisation that they currently act more like an IT help desk , rather than a strategic department . <p> Yet going one step deeper , it 's also important to take the time to analyse your organisation 's digital skills , resources , and tools to be able to identify where the gaps are and what your internal conditions for success should look like . <p> Get your leadership on board <p> We found only 23 per cent of CEOs are the voice of digital in their organisation , despite being perceived as the strongest digital leaders and most effective advocates for digital success . <p> We 've found that workshopping digital strategies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , helps get them on board with the impact of digital . Also focusing on the risk ( rather than opportunities ) of not using digital is effective at the executive level . <p> Ultimately , to have real organisational impact , and help your leadership see the true value of digital , you need to have a data driven approach that measures impact and proves the ROI of digital through analysis and data . <p> Have a vision <p> Only four in 10 organisations we surveyed had a digital vision , and for the 60 per cent without a digital vision , digital success is near impossible . We saw that organisations were significantly less likely to track the impact of their digital investments , believe they have strong digital leadership and feel confident in their digital marketing proficiency without a clear vision of what digital means for their organisation . <p> A vision is crucial to help align your digital staff to your long-term organisational goals , and will protect digital from vicious funding cycles and being treated like an IT help desk . <p> Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and perseverance : it 's not an overnight exercise . <p> But with a complete understanding of digital in your organisation , a CEO who is your digital champion and a clear digital vision , your team will be empowered to reach your long-term organisational goals and can avoid being distracted by short-term ad hoc requests . <p> About the author : Richenda Vermeulen is the director of ntegrity , a digital consultancy that helps NFPs implement innovative solutions to improve fundraising and communications .

 <p> Effective Philanthropy in the , 6th April 2017 at 8:49 am <p> Philanthropy is in a " pretty good state in Australia " , according to documentary filmmaker Ian Darling who was named the leading philanthropist at the 2017 Philanthropy Australia Awards . <p> The awards , held in Melbourne on Wednesday night , celebrated innovative partnerships between grantmakers and not for profits , highlighting significant achievements of projects that helped solve complex societal issues . <p> In total , six of Australia 's most strategic funders were recognised for the impact of their giving . <p> Philanthropy Australia CEO Sarah Davis said the awards provided an important opportunity to recognise the " unique accomplishments " of those who were working to create " lasting and positive change " , both in Australia and abroad . <p> " Although Australian philanthropic organisations stand at the forefront of innovation , their important work is often done behind the scenes , " Davis said . <p> " The awards showcase the many impressive examples of great leadership in philanthropic giving . <p> " The awards attracted a strong field across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nominees , finalists and winners . " <p> This year 's winners , selected for their " visionary , high impact and transformative philanthropy " were : <p> Darling , who is the executive director of Shark Island Productions and the not-for-profit Shark Island Institute , as well as chair of The Caledonia Foundation and chair and moderator of Good Pitch ? Australia , told Pro Bono News it was " humbling " to be acknowledged . <p> " There are so many people who are doing incredible things so it is very humbling when I see that I am named philanthropist of the year , " Darling said . <p> " It 's a great honour . I 'm not sure if I 'm the most deserving one for it , but I am very grateful for it . " <p> Darling said he was unsure whether he considered himself a " philanthropist " . <p> " It 's a title that I guess can come with a lot of baggage but also I guess one has to accept the title , " he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their eighties or nineties who was giving at the end of their life but I think in the last 15 years I 've seen that that 's not the case and that it is never too early or late to start as a philanthropist . <p> " So I think whilst I am now a full time documentary filmmaker , everything that I do with my filmmaking hat on has a philanthropic angle to it and every film is trying to shift some aspect of the community . We always try to attach an outreach and education program to it , so I guess just the very base nature of what I 'm doing is quite a philanthropic endeavour . <p> " And then I guess I have a lot of other philanthropic activities outside of filmmaking , so whether I am a philanthropist I 'm not sure but I am heavily engaged with many philanthropic activities . " <p> He said the role of philanthropy on today 's society was to " innovate and enhance and provide support where government either fears to tread or is n't providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to show even greater leadership of the need for philanthropic and government support in so many areas where it is still being neglected , " he said . <p> " I think over the last 15 years or so , when the government made it so much easier to set up your own foundation , that has lead to a massive shift at that level and I think so many people are setting up their own foundations and I think with the success of a number of community foundations , even with more modest sums , there is a lot of proactive activity . <p> " And I think there is a lot of good work being done at the next gen level , with the kids of philanthropists or just kids who have just left school and are doing stuff off their own bat , I think there 's a much healthier attitude than there has been in generations previously and it is right across the board . <p> " When I came back from being overseas for a year in 2005 and I had seen a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in the US and I saw that it was virtually non-existent in Australia , and I think that was one of the motivations for setting up the Documentary Australia Foundation , " he said , <p> " To create a vehicle that not only had charitable status but to educate the market on why documentary should be a part of everyone 's gift giving strategy and why it is in fact an extension of so many of the existing strategies . <p> " It is not supporting documentary for documentary sake , although it is great to think that people would support that as an art form in its own right , but using it as an effective tool to increase the effectiveness of their gift giving in whatever area that they happen to be giving to . <p> " So in the instance we created our own documentary around youth homelessness and there was a lot of philanthropic support in that area by groups who were already working in the space , but actually saw that raising awareness of the plight of the homeless and trying to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embraced . <p> " It needed an Australian example like this but also a vehicle like the Documentary Australia Foundation to really educate the philanthropic community , the not-for-profit community and the filmmakers , so it was a good first step in starting to increase the acceptance of documentary and philanthropy working together . " <p> But he said he did n't set out for it to be a philanthropic project , rather he decided to make the documentary after working at the Oasis Youth Support Network and seeing the " enormity of the problem and how much it was off the agenda " . <p> " So initially the intent was to create a really confronting film that took the plight of the homeless to as many living rooms as possible but soon after we started filming , and it reinforced how great the problem was , we thought we would take a more strategic approach , " he said . <p> " We commissioned a national youth commission into homelessness , which was one of the first major reports for 20 years and that was where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only with the film but with what we were doing with it . <p> " And so whilst it soon became sort of a strategy , it was n't initially part of it . <p> " But by the time we released it , we realised we had something quite powerful . Not only with the film but this major report which we presented to the government and the findings from an Australia wide youth commission , and this provided the momentum for the government of the day to then produce a green paper and white paper on homelessness , which gave the sector enormous confidence and heart that something was actually going to be done about homelessness . " <p> He said it was frustrating that while there had been " good inroads " made , nine years on the problem was " only getting worse " . <p> " When we set out on this homeless journey we actually said we 've got to apply a 20 year approach to it and so we 're almost halfway there , " he said . <p> " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue and more evidence based research and really try and work with the philanthropic community and the whole sector again to try and get even greater visibility on the enormity of this growing problem . " <p> He said his ultimate goal through his work was to continue to support documentary and encourage effective philanthropy . <p> " I think when I become aware of a problem or situation , I find it hard at times not to try and do something about it , " he said . <p> " But I think ultimately I have found that working with documentary and getting the philanthropic community to collaborate around that and then getting the not-for-profit sector to also be a part of that , and work in an engaged and collaborative way , I think that is a great formula for effective philanthropy . <p> " So I guess I want to keep working in this space with supporting documentary whether it is my own or other peoples , to help solve some of these really important issue that continue to go from bad to worse in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can really humanise a very complex issue and it puts a face to homelessness or domestic violence or racism or intolerance or whatever it may be so I guess my ultimate goal is just to keep working with documentary and keep supporting the sector to increase the effectiveness of gift giving and outcomes along the way . <p> " Because in order to solve many of these problems you actually need scale and it is very , very difficult to do it if we are all working in silos . You do need to collaborate with the not-for-profit sector as well and I think talking about the importance of that and being very , very strategic on the way , because funds are scarce and we need to do a lot more with what we 've got . And I think this strategic collaborative approach , using storytelling that humanises the subjects in the issue , is a very potent formula for philanthropy. " 
 <p> High Number of Submissions to Centrelink Senate Inquiry ' , 6th April 2017 at 3:30 pm <p> More than 100 submissions have been made to a Senate inquiry into the federal government 's controversial Centrelink debt-recovery program with less than half being available for public viewing . <p> The Senate inquiry , which was set up in February 2017 , is looking into the design , scope , cost-benefit analysis , contracts and implementation processes associated with the government 's Better Management of the Social Welfare System initiative . <p> Inquiry chair , Greens Senator Rachel Siewert said : " Submissions to the inquiry so far show that people have found the government 's automated debt recovery system distressing and frightening . <p> " A lot of the submissions are either confidential or have their name withheld , which I think demonstrates that people feel intimidated about speaking out . <p> " I am glad that people are still submitting so we can hear personal experiences to help understand the impact of this process . Evidence given at the hearings will deepen that understanding . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing wrong with their approach , that certainly is n't what I 'm hearing and seeing . " <p> Welfare peak body ACOSS said in its submission and during the first public hearings of the inquiry that the government must immediately stop the debt-recovery program . <p> " We are greatly concerned by the continuation of the automated debt collection program or Online <p> Compliance Intervention ( OCI ) . The program is one of the most significant failures in government administration in recent history and has caused extensive distress and human suffering , " the ACOSS submission said . <p> " There must be an independent review of all alleged debts raised by the OCI that are under repayment or have been repaid to assess whether they are owed and , if so , whether they are accurate . This should include review of the 10 per cent recovery fee . <p> " The department must automatically stop recovery of a debt where it is under reassessment , review or appeal ... and it must not apply the 10 per cent recovery fee and must refund it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Social Security Rights Network ( NSSRN ) , in its detailed 17 page submission , called on the Senate committee to recommend that the OCI system also be abandoned . <p> The NSSRN pointed , in particular , to the increased and unusual use of " averaging " the income of welfare recipients . <p> " If the person does not supply information because they do not respond at all or do not use the optional function in the online platform , the OCI system averages the total income across the period of employment recorded by the ATO . As a result , ' averaging ' is not a last resort in the OCI system . It is much more prevalent and , as a result , there are more incorrect debt assessments , " the NSSRN submission said . <p> " The legality of the use of averaging by the OCI system is complex . However , any concern about the legality of administrative decision-making is serious and the committee should ask DHS to justify the legality of the increased prevalence of averaging under the OCI process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should at least be suspended until necessary improvements are identified and made in consultation with stakeholders , including people affected by the system and community organisations . " <p> However a submission from the Department of Human Services said averaging only occurred when a welfare recipient either allowed it to happen or failed to respond to correspondence . <p> " It is incorrect to imply that the department always averages , or that the system always averages over the full year . Averaging of income is applied when people do not contact the department with their information , " the department said . <p> A submission from disability peak body , People With Disability said the auto-debt recovery program had undermined the proper functioning of the social security system safety net , while " simultaneously destroying public confidence in the government 's ability to protect vulnerable people " . <p> " This robo-debt system must be immediately stopped , and an appropriate , measured , and well-planned approach to social security debt recovery implemented , " PWD 's submission said . <p> " We strongly urge the committee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister for human services and the department have undertaken comprehensive consultation and review processes , including with people affected by the initiative , to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place before moving forward . <p> " Many people with disability ... have been issued with complicated and unclear debt notifications , and were distraught , overwhelmed and confused about what they had to do in response to the letters and SMS they had received . In some cases , the first , and only time , people were contacted was by debt collectors . Those who were able to access the MyGov website still were n't able to understand what needed to be done to address the potential debt . <p> " To make matters worse , no guidance was given in the correspondence from Centrelink to direct people to where they could access support to navigate this complicated situation . Given that Centrelink staff members were not available to provide advice around the debt collection process , people were in many cases confused and desperate for support . "

She is this week 's Changemaker . <p> Curtis is driven by a desire to push leaders to transform the world for the better , whether that be in the workplace or broader community . <p> She graduated with a masters in business leadership and in 2001 established her own leadership development company . <p> In collaboration with Dr Nicky Howe , she launched the Engaging Young Leaders on Aged Care and Community Boards and the pair have since gone on to share their experience of the program in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championing Diversity on Boards . <p> Through her company , Curtis has also just launched a campaign to inspire , educate and support 1,000 new young directors to join a not-for-profit board . The initiative hopes to increase diversity , support succession planning and improve local communities " through better discussions , decisions and outcomes on boards " . <p> According to Curtis , when a variety of perspectives are included around the boardroom , " everyone wins " . <p> On Friday , was named one of Westpac 's 200 Businesses of Tomorrow chosen from 2000 applicants . <p> Curtis is also the co-founder and inaugural board chair of a women 's giving circle called 100 Women which inspires " everyday people to become powerful philanthropists " . <p> She was named in the Westpac and Australian Financial Review 's 100 Women of Influence List across Australia . <p> In this week 's Changemaker , she talks about creating a " manual " to champion diversity in the boardroom , how philanthropy has been hijacked by the rich and famous and why leaders must be committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You have said your leadership journey started when you were 12 years old and you attended the first International Children 's Conference organised by the United Nations . What attracted you to leadership ? <p> It was n't leadership per se but it was just the opportunity to improve society that attracted me . I was involved in an environment club at my school and that 's what really led me to have the opportunity to attend the International Children 's Conference . That was such a huge catalyst in my life because I was surrounded by all of these people from many different countries around the world who had this intense passion and desire to make the world a better place . And so it really set me on this journey of putting community first and having a purpose bigger than yourself . It put me on this track to really sort of follow those things rather than other things , so it was wonderful . <p> Where has that journey taken you since then ? <p> It has taken me all around the world . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different things , start my own business and most importantly be able to contribute to meaningful change in the world . So it was a very powerful catalyst and one that stays with me . <p> You established your own leadership development company in 2001 . Why is good leadership important ? <p> It is just integral to be able to get things done . It is important because we need to be building positive visions for the future about how we can always do things better . And I think part of that is about being able to empower others , and empower the unlikely leaders , to be able to see that everybody has a place in building a positive vision for the future and making it happen . <p> Why do we need to encourage more young leaders into the sector ? <p> " Why not ? " really is the question . <p> You 've got all of these highly educated , worldly young leaders who want to contribute at a board level , so they want to contribute their skills and expertise and knowledge voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that aside , the research shows us that our boards in particular are filled with only 10 per cent who are under 40 years old . So there is a huge imperative there from a succession planning perspective to share knowledge , and expertise and understanding between board directors from different generations . I think we can learn a lot from each other and I think we get richer results when we actually work together . <p> The research also undoubtedly tells us that diversity of perspective leads to better conversations and decisions and even an engagement of all stakeholders . So aside from succession planning , we get better results when we have diversity in the boardroom . <p> So there 's a couple of reasons why it 's amazing to encourage these young leaders who are just so passionate about learning more about the sector and learning more from sector leaders and engaging them in being able to gather their skills and expertise and experience for the betterment of the sector . <p> You have recently written Difference Makers , A Leader 's Guide to Championing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aim for the book ? <p> The aim was really to share what we had learned from the program Engaging Young Leaders on Aged Care and Community Boards because it has been such a wonderful learning journey for all of us about what is leadership , what does it look like , what is diversity , how do we encourage it , what is collaboration in the sector and how do we foster more collaboration within the sector , because we all say that we want more collaboration but we tend not to know how to do it . Our organisations are n't really set up for it and there are not many examples of really true collaborations that are done well . <p> So we really wanted to document everything we had learned . This is our fifth year in the program and we 've just had so many fantastic community leaders support us along the way . So it was really about putting a line in the sand and really documenting everything that we had learned and sharing that with others . <p> But I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of resistance around diversity in the boardroom so we wanted to have a resource that we could share with others , which really shared the business case for diversity and challenged people to step up and be champions for diversity in the boardroom and this is sort of the manual to be able to do that . <p> You are the co-founder and inaugural board chair of 100 Women . What role do you think philanthropy has in the world today ? <p> Philanthropy is an amazing opportunity to engage and connect and give back to the community . It really allows us to decide on the issues that need improvement and learn how we can direct funding for long-term change . I think a lot of people are on the other side of the grantmaking process , in that they are applying for grants , and 100 Women gives us an opportunity to look at : " Ok , we 're fundraising this amount of money , how do we collectively decide where it needs to go and how best to utilise that money for a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giving circle changed philanthropy and opened it up ? <p> As part of our mission we talk about inspiring everyday people to become philanthropists because philanthropy has been hijacked by the rich and famous . Really , when you come back to the root of the word philanthropy it means lover of humanity . And there are many people who are strongly contributing to humanity in different ways , not only just by giving money but by giving time and expertise and networks but allowing us to really understand how do we use the money that we 've got when we collectively bring it together . We might not have hundreds of thousands of dollars to give ourselves but if we come together collectively we can all of a sudden grant these major projects and that 's really exciting because it shows that everyday people have the opportunity to interact in our community in that way , we do n't have to wait for government , we do n't have to wait for even traditional foundations to get started , we can come together and utilise our own money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our world . <p> Why did you choose to focus on women ? <p> It 's not a decision that we take on lightly . And as with everything there is an unconscious bias against women in funding and so we are told that actually funding women and girls is one of the best returns on investments to lift our communities out of poverty and yet there 's not many funding sources out there for women and girls projects . <p> So I was actually first inspired by the book Half the Sky Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide , by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn which is a very powerful book which displays the discrimination that still happens in our world , around the world , against women and girls . When I read that book I thought I ca n't just sit back and not do anything to support other women who do n't have the same rights and opportunities as me . And there are plenty of wonderful organisations out there doing great things for women and girls and what they need is funding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men who want to support women and girls being able to receive the same opportunities in our world . <p> You were named in the Westpac and Australian Financial Review 's 100 Women of Influence List in 2014 . How does it feel to be recognised for the work you do ? <p> So proud and absolutely grateful to be acknowledged alongside the amazing women in that list , both in WA and around Australia . They are women that I absolutely admire and I still feel like I 'm at the start of my leadership journey and to get that recognition and support , I feel grateful just to be name along side those women . <p> Through your work what is your ultimate goal ? <p> I 'm absolutely driven by the purpose of my business really to build a global community of inspiring leaders and changemakers who are committed to improving themselves to improve the world around them . Any leadership starts with ourselves and being able to improve and develop ourselves as leaders and then be able to take that and use it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own leadership so we can be better leaders to improve society and the world around us . <p> How do you make time for yourself ? <p> I had to laugh at that question because there is not much time to myself at the moment . I 've just had a baby , so he is five months old , then I 've got a **25;298;TOOLONG too , so alongside them and the business , which has many different projects on the go , and my volunteering commitments , there 's not too much time for myself . But I do try . Time for myself at the moment is spending time with my family . 
 <p> Money ca n't buy you happiness , but what you actually do for a living is key , according to new research which found not-for-profit workers were among the most satisfied . <p> Curtin University in collaboration with mwah ( Making Work Absolutely Human ) has launched a new report to find the happiest and unhappiest workers in Australia and what contributed to greater satisfaction in the workplace . <p> The report , Happy Workers : How Satisfied are Australians at Work ? released on Wednesday , found while pay , job security and hours of work counted , it was the job itself that mattered most . <p> Report author Associate Professor Rebecca Cassells from the Curtin Business School said the report highlighted the working conditions that were likely to bring Australians the most job satisfaction . <p> " Australians who work for themselves or in small businesses , in the not-for-profit or government sector and workers that can do some of their work from home each week are more likely to be satisfied in their jobs , " Cassells said . <p> " The trade-off between happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident . <p> " It 's unlikely that any job will deliver everything that is needed to be happy at work , but certain things can help . " <p> The report examined all aspects of work satisfaction across location , pay , generation , gender , education levels , hours of work , occupations , industries and business sizes . <p> It found that pay was associated with higher job satisfaction but only to a point , and that those who reported being " very satisfied " with their job overall earned a lower average amount each week than those who reported being " satisfied " . <p> Higher job satisfaction was also associated with older workers and those living further away from major cities . <p> Tasmania was shown to be leading the way when it came to happy workers compared to Western Australia and Victoria which ranked last among states . <p> Other key findings of the report included : <p> Around 40 per cent of Australian workers reported being " very satisfied " with their job security and 36 per cent with their flexibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aussies ( 29 per cent ) were dissatisfied with payment and working hours . <p> Gen Y and Gen X were more likely to report being dissatisfied in their job than other generations . <p> Higher education levels did not necessarily translate into higher satisfaction at work . <p> Women were more likely to report being " very satisfied " in their job overall than men ( 31 per cent compared to 27 per cent ) . <p> Satisfaction with job flexibility and hours of work decreased rapidly beyond 38 hours per week . <p> Australians who worked for themselves or in micro-businesses were more likely to report being very satisfied with their job than those in big companies . <p> CEO of mwah Rhonda Brighton-Hall told Pro Bono News there were " quite a few surprises " in the findings . <p> " There are a few things that intuitively you know are true and then when you see them in the report , you go : ' Oh yeah we knew that ' . Things like , you get less happy the more hours you work over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and we know that , even though a lot of us do it and we do it too often , " Brighton-Hall said . <p> " But there were also things that broke the rules a little bit . So I thought it was very interesting that people over 70 years old are the happiest , because we tend to talk about them as if they would be a bit exhausted or not really committed , but they 're actually the happiest workers we have and the most highly engaged which is fantastic . <p> " With the fact that more of us will be working into our 70s , it is probably a good sign . And the second happiest were people under 22 which is another group that we tend to go : ' Oh they 're always whining ' . But actually they 're the second happiest which is good news too I thought . <p> " More importantly , it 's what you do , how you are able to go about your work and who is alongside you that matters the most when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sense that the not-for-profit sector were among the happiest at work . <p> " The number one factor in being happy at work is doing work that you love , and I think in the not-for-profit sector you find people who are very passionate about what they do , very committed and their work really matters to them , " she said . <p> " I 've had so many businesses come and say : ' should we put in couches , should we put ping pong tables in ' , and all this sort of jazz , and you say : ' you can if you want to , but it 's got nothing to do with anything ' . <p> " It is the work you do and the people you do it with and when you get into not for profits , you often find people who are likeminded , they share a value system and they really care about the stuff you are doing , so that 's why you find people who are probably some of the happiest we have . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> " We tend to talk about work as work versus leisure which is an economic sort of discussion , and then we talk about it from a legal perspective , what do bosses have to do , what do companies with titles do and all that sort of jazz , but just to actually be part of work is humanity , the opportunity to get up and go and contribute to the community or the people you work with and live around , the opportunity to be part of something , a social connection , " she said . <p> " I mean if you work with disability or you work with people having a very hard time getting work , you realise that work is incredibly important to all of us and I think that 's a much better discussion than purely economic for example . " <p> " But I think much more importantly than that is just simply , we do n't just want to be building sustainable businesses , we want to be building sustainable society , and sustainable communities and to do that we have to make work human .

 <p> A report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman into the operations of the federal government 's controversial Centrelink auto-debt recovery program has found that the system had poor administration which failed to communicate adequately with customers . <p> A report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman into the operations of the federal government 's controversial Centrelink auto-debt recovery program has found that the system had poor administration which failed to communicate adequately with customers . <p> The ombudsman 's report , which was released Monday , said it had received many complaints about the new online compliance intervention ( OCI ) system that was established to raise and recover debts or overpayments from welfare recipients . <p> Acting Commonwealth Ombudsman , Richard Glenn said he acknowledged that the Department of Human Service ( DHS ) had made changes to the OCI since its initial rollout . <p> " However , we consider there are several areas where further improvements could be made , particularly before use of the OCI is expanded , " Glenn said . <p> " In our view , many of the OCI 's implementation problems could have been mitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This includes more rigorous user testing with customers and service delivery staff , a more incremental rollout , and better communication to staff and stakeholders . <p> " DHS ' project planning did not ensure all relevant external stakeholders were consulted during key planning stages and after the full rollout of the OCI . This is evidenced by the extent of confusion and inaccuracy in public statements made by key non-government stakeholders , journalists and individuals . " <p> He said a key lesson for agencies and policy makers when proposing to rollout large scale measures which require people to engage in a new way with new digital channels , was for agencies " to engage with stakeholders and provide resources for adequate manual support during transition periods " . <p> " We have recommended DHS undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the OCI in its current form before it is implemented further and any future rollout should be done incrementally , " he said . <p> This report comes as a Senate inquiry is also investigating the Centrelink auto-debt program . <p> More than 100 submissions have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for public viewing . <p> The Senate inquiry , which was set up in February 2017 , is looking into the design , scope , cost-benefit analysis , contracts and implementation processes associated with the government 's Better Management of the Social Welfare System initiative . <p> Inquiry chair , Greens Senator Rachel Siewert said : " Submissions to the inquiry so far show that people have found the government 's automated debt recovery system distressing and frightening . <p> " A lot of the submissions are either confidential or have their name withheld , which I think demonstrates that people feel intimidated about speaking out . " <p> Shadow minister for human services Linda Burney said the Commonwealth Ombudsman 's report confirmed the robo-debt system was " plagued by poor administration and a failure of Centrelink to communicate adequately with customers " . <p> " The damning report comes despite the minister 's insistence earlier this year that ' the system is working well ' , " Burney said . <p> " The ombudsman finds that the litany of problems in the robo-debt system ' could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset ' , raising serious questions about minister Alan Tudge 's oversight of his department . <p> " This report makes it plain -- customers ca n't get clear information , the Department of Human Services did n't provide adequate staff training and there was a total failure of planning and transparency .

 <h> The Evolution of Housing for People with Disabilities <p> Australia needs to work towards a future where the disability service system and housing solutions work together and where the current limits to choice and control are progressively removed writes Dr George Taleporos , policy manager at the Summer Foundation . <p> The Evolution of Housing for People with , 11th April 2017 at 8:33 am <p> Australia needs to work towards a future where the disability service system and housing solutions work together and where the current limits to choice and control are progressively removed writes Dr George Taleporos , policy manager at the Summer Foundation . <p> This week on the ABC 's Lateline program , people with disabilities had a glimpse of the future of disability housing in Australia a future where people with disabilities choose where they live and who they live with . <p> This is something that most of us take for granted , but for people with disabilities it is an exciting new possibility that the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) is promising to deliver . The NDIS ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people with disabilities to have choice about their housing by allocating housing payments to the individual with a disability rather than the service provider . <p> Choosing where you live and who you live with is critical to addressing the high levels of violence and abuse that people with disabilities are subjected to . The endemic violence and abuse in government funded group homes has been revealed in a range of state and federal parliamentary inquiries and is well-known to people with disabilities and disability advocates . Unfortunately , this model of housing is the dominant housing option in Australia for people with disabilities . Very few alternatives exist for people with high support needs and the most common alternative is residential aged care , another unacceptable option . <p> This is why the Summer Foundation , Australia 's leading advocacy organisation that works to stop people with disabilities being forced into nursing homes has created Summer Housing , a not-for-profit sister organisation which will develop new housing options . These housing options will enable people with disabilities to live in their own apartment in a mainstream residential development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to . The new housing options will build upon the Hunter housing project that was showcased in the Lateline program , incorporating the latest in design and technology as well as 24-hour on call assistance to enable people with high support needs to live independently in the community . <p> Summer Housing has recently signed a contract with Grocon to develop 11 new apartments in a medium-density apartment complex in Fairfield , Victoria . This is an exciting step towards increasing the range and quality of housing for people with disabilities . There will be more on the way in a range of sought-after locations across Australia . <p> I am proud of these developments , not only as the policy manager at the Summer Foundation , but as a person with high support needs who has been advocating for the improving housing options for people with disabilities for the last 20 years . As a disability advocate , I have first-hand knowledge of a broken disability service system , where housing is both inaccessible and unaffordable and where people with high support needs are forced to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . <p> At the Summer Foundation my work life provides me with opportunities to challenge the system , shift the power to people with disabilities , and demonstrate that individualised independent living is possible , even for people with " severe " disabilities like me . <p> The future that we need to work towards is one where the disability service system and housing solutions work together , where one does n't compromise the other and where the current limits to choice and control are progressively removed . How we do this is by developing an evidence base , one that is well informed by the experiences of people with disabilities . We use that evidence to prototype solutions and evaluate them so that the evolution of housing options for people with disabilities continues . <p> Systemic change is an evolving process . The thousands of group homes in Australia today , are largely mini institutions that evolved from the large-scale institutions of the 1960s and 70s . Once upon a time , group homes were seen as innovative , and they were , compared to the large institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's housing landscape for people with disabilities , our Hunter Housing Project is innovative but at some point it will be outdated and better solutions will emerge . This Hunter model provides 24/7 on site support , an initial approach that we are evaluating as we look for a solution to move people with high support needs out of nursing homes . When planning commenced several years ago , little was known about how the NDIS would fund housing and support for people with high needs and a single service provider was considered to be the only viable option at the time . <p> This is the journey that we are on , housing solutions are evolving but they can only evolve in the right direction when we are prepared to be critical about what we are doing and are prepared to test what could work better . We also need the policy levers to be set to encourage innovation and accessibility for all people , including those of us with a disability . SDA payments to people with disabilities are an important part of this but so too is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all new housing developments . <p> While housing is evolving , service provision is devolving . From government , down to service providers , and now finally to where the power belongs , with people with disabilities . This is an essential principle of the NDIS , putting choice and control and with that , power , in the hands of people with disabilities . It is about somewhat abstract yet critical concepts , such as self-determination , self-development and dignity of risk . It 's about people with disabilities being in charge of our lives , of who supports us and how we are supported . It 's about taking charge , being in charge and with that , taking on responsibilities that we may not have had before . <p> Unfortunately , many people with disabilities , especially people with disabilities living in group homes and nursing homes , may not have at this point in time , discovered their capacity to direct their supports and take on that responsibility . Our challenge is to build housing solutions that are not only physically accessible but that support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards self-direction and self-determination . <p> Only then will we see an inclusive community where people with disabilities have access to the same opportunities that the rest of society takes for granted . We should also see inroads in the reduction of violence perpetrated against people with disabilities as we have the power to decide who we live with and how we are supported . <p> About the author : Dr George Taleporos has more than 20 years experience in the disability field , focused predominantly on advocacy , human rights policy and practice , service development and management .

 <p> Businesses of Tomorrow are in Good , 11th April 2017 at 4:58 pm <p> A social enterprise that connects those who can give with those in need has been named as one of the top 20 businesses of tomorrow . <p> Giving platform was chosen from almost 2,000 applications as a " high potential business of tomorrow " as part of Westpac Businesses of Tomorrow program . <p> In total , Westpac recognised 200 businesses , with a collective turnover of approximately $2 billion per year , " that have the drive to boost the nation 's future as Australia transitions to a services and knowledge-based economy " . Of those 20 businesses were highlighted for high potential . <p> Westpac Institutional Bank chief executive Lyn Coble said the calibre of applicants , which were chosen based on criteria including business purpose , contribution the community , current strengths and vision for the future , had been " extremely high " . <p> " These are leaders with a strong sense of purpose and the capability to think differently about meeting customer needs that exist today and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobley said . <p> Judge and Westpac Business Bank chief executive David Lindberg said had made a significant impact . <p> " As Australia 's first unified workplace giving and volunteering rewards platform , GoodCompany has made a significant impact on the Australian not for profit sector , " Lindberg said . <p> " Through making it easy and empowering staff to give their time , talent and donations to causes in need , GoodCompany helps make a positive impact to the lives of many Australians . " <p> GoodCompany CEO Ash Rosshandler said they were honoured to be included in such an " impressive cohort " and he credited the win to the hard work of his team as well as support from key corporate partners and thousands of charities around the nation . <p> " I guess we 're trying to think about it as a win for everyone , " Rosshandler told Pro Bono News . <p> " It is a really good chance to acknowledge a lot of the corporates who have been on the journey with us a long time and all the charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us over 10 years now . <p> " So it is interesting to work at something for about 10 years and then be recognised as a business of tomorrow . " <p> Of the 200 businesses chosen for the award , technology businesses made up 40 per cent , with health and education businesses each making up 9 per cent of the list . <p> Lindberg said the list represented the diversity of Australia with " large and small , new and established businesses , across all industries and sectors " . <p> " It 's pleasing to see strong representation among service-led sectors such as health , professional services and technology , all predicted to have strong growth over the next 10 years . These businesses demonstrated the potential for a higher purpose , " he said . <p> said it was " critical " for social enterprises and organisations in the social sector to be included on the same platform as other corporates . <p> " Hireup was in the top 20 and within the top 200 there was The Difference Incubator , and Who Gives A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could probably class as social enterprises . I think it is really important , " he said . <p> " Even at the summit they had people on stage , a few of the business leaders and it is important that people from the social sector are there peppering them with questions , saying : ' You know great , let 's look at tomorrow and how can businesses be a force for good and how can they help ' . <p> " I think that voice is really important and I think what Westpac has done by including us in the top 20 is really acknowledge that it is important . " <p> As part of Westpac Businesses of Tomorrow , the top 200 businesses gathered at a summit in Sydney alongside business leaders , to network , share knowledge , and collaborate on the future of Australian business . <p> " We know that networking and collaboration are among the top drivers of business success , " Lindberg said . <p> " Bringing together 200 businesses that all have the potential to shape our nation 's future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are helping the next generation of Australian businesses to thrive and succeed in a changing world . " <p> The top 20 high potential businesses also participated in a tailored mentoring program with influential business leaders including Carla Zampatti AC , Ita Buttrose AO OBE , John Eales AM , Tim Fung and Andrew Vesey . <p> The 20 businesses will receive a tailored $100,000 professional services package and a global study tour in the USA and China . <p> said they were " really excited " to be mentored by Simon Ca n't . <p> " He is the CEO of Reinventure , and he also was one of the founding partners of SVA , " he said . <p> " He has got a great social bent and a great commercial understanding and good on tech side , so we spent our three hours of mentoring walking around Sydney , down at the Rocks , we did a walk and talk , and he is just lovely . We are hoping that leads to good things .

We just bought the url too .

 <p> People are becoming more charitable in the UK with almost nine in 10 people ( 89 per cent ) saying they did something " charitable " last year , according to a major not-for-profit study on giving . <p> The Charities Aid Foundation ( CAF ) annual UK giving report found that giving money to charity held steady last year despite huge political developments , such as Brexit , with donations totalling ? 9.7 billion ( billion ) . And a month-by-month survey since the EU referendum showed no shift in people 's reported giving . <p> The report found that the giving trend was a significant increase on 2015 when 79 per cent of people said they did something " charitable " . <p> Well over half of the population donated money ( 61 per cent ) or gave goods to charity ( 56 per cent ) and one in six ( 17 per cent ) volunteered <p> Medical research was the most popular cause . Just over one in four people ( 26 per cent ) gave to a medical research charity last year , closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and young people ( 24 per cent ) . <p> The median average contribution for a charitable donation or sponsorship was ? 18 ( A$30 ) . The report said cash was still the most common way for people to give , accounting for 58 per cent of people having donated in this way . Slightly more than one in four ( 26 per cent ) gave online . <p> But CAF said there had been a " Brexit-effect " on other types of support for charities and causes , with volunteering and campaigning both up since the referendum . <p> More than half of UK adults ( 56 per cent ) said they signed a petition in the past year . The number of people saying they had taken part in a public demonstration or protest was also comparatively high at 6 per cent -- equivalent to three million UK adults . <p> People who voted in the EU referendum whether they opted to remain or leave were more likely to have done something charitable in 2016 than those who did n't vote at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge change was taking place all around us last year , one thing which remained consistent was the reliable and enduring generosity of people in the UK in their support of good causes . <p> " The consequences and impact of the EU referendum result are likely to become increasingly apparent over the months and years ahead . <p> " Our research shows that there has been no ' ' on charitable donations so far , but there has been a noticeable increase in people engaging in social and political issues . Numbers of people who said they signed a petition or took part in a protest or demonstration last year are the highest recorded in more than a decade of us producing this report . <p> " We know that people increasingly feel they want to make a difference and many see charities as a way to achieve that . Charities already play an integral role in the lives of so many . At this critical time in our nation 's history , their importance is only likely to increase . " <p> The study also found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of men said they had not participated in any charitable activity in the past year , compared with just 8 per cent of women . <p> Younger people were less likely to donate money than older people ( 54 per cent of 16 to 24 year olds donated in the last year , versus 68 per cent of those aged 65-plus ) but they were more likely to volunteer , sign a petition or take part in a public demonstration or protest . <p> Charitable giving peaked in November . More than two-in-five people ( 41 per cent ) said they had given in the month of high profile campaigns like Children in Need , the Poppy appeal and Movember . <p> The CAF UK giving report has been published annually since 2004 . The report is in contrast to a CAF report in March which revealed that almost one in five UK charities feared their organisation was struggling to survive . <p> And The Social Landscape 2017 report , the UK 's biggest survey of charity chief executives , warned that the challenges facing charities were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restructuring , downsizing and joining forces with other organisations as they struggle to raise enough money to meet growing demand , " the report said . <p> The survey revealed that rising demand and an increasingly tough financial environment may be pushing some organisations to breaking point . <p> " Almost one in five ( 18 per cent ) fear their organisation is struggling to survive , rising to more than one in four ( 28 per cent ) among charities with an annual income less than ? 1 million ( million ) . More than a third had to dip into their reserves last year to cover income shortfalls , " the report found . <p> In Australia the release of the landmark Giving Australia research in December 2016 found that an estimated 14.9 million Australian adults ( 80.8 per cent ) gave a total of $12.5 billion to charities and not-for-profit organisations over 12 months in 2015/16 ( up from $7.7 billion in 2005 ) . <p> In 2016 the average donation was $764.08 and the median donation was $200 . <p> However the research pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of people donating slightly decreased , the average donation increased in real terms by $210.16 . <p> Lead researcher and director of Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies at QUT Associate Professor Wendy Scaife told Pro Bono Australia News that while Australia was seeing an improvement in giving overall in 2016 it was not " the gilded age of giving " that researchers noted when they started the project in 2005 . <p> " Then we were coming off the back of 10 years of really strong economic growth ... and when there is a strong economy there is strong giving , " Scaife said . <p> " It 's not the gilded age of giving . It 's not the wonderful growth in giving that we were noting back then but even though it is going ahead you would have to say with a note of caution it is starting to flatline. "

 <h> Tough Times ? <p> There are flaws in Australia 's " tough times " narrative and concerned charities should understand that this discourse is not about our economy but about politics , writes David Crosbie , CEO of the Community Council for Australia . <p> There are flaws in Australia 's " tough times " narrative and concerned charities should understand that this discourse is not about our economy but about politics , writes David Crosbie , CEO of the Community Council for Australia . <p> In the lead up to the federal budget some charities are increasingly concerned about potential cuts to their government funded programs and services . Some have grounds for their fears , others are responding to a growing public discourse about " tough times " in Australia . <p> It is not unusual at this stage of the budget cycle for governments to lower our expectations , highlight how difficult our economic circumstances are , the size of our debt , and the projected blow-outs in expenditure . It is grist to the mill of a narrative about tough times needing tough measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our support for the poor , the disadvantaged , the old and the i 'll . Tough times mean we should slash our foreign aid to the lowest level ever , not make the investments we need in education , health , housing , arts , legal services and infrastructure until we struggle our way out of debt . <p> The tough times narrative also provides the rationale for making short-term economic gain the main measuring stick for government investment . <p> Few question the fundamental assumption that Australians are doing it do so is to be " out of touch " , to display a level of financial illiteracy ( you can not spend more than you have ) or to be an irresponsible hedonist seeking to spend now and put the debt on generations to come . <p> At the risk of being labelled all of the above , I think it is important to highlight the fundamental flaws in the tough times argument . <p> The first flaw is that most of us are not going through tough times at all , we just think we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . Our wealth , depending on how you count it , puts us in the top three in the OECD . Our household disposable income is in the top 10 . We are one of the very richest nations on earth , well ahead of most OECD countries . <p> Debt is an issue , but not quite the problem it is portrayed to be . Germany , Finland , Israel all have higher levels of government debt to GDP . The UK , USA , Belgium , Canada , France and Spain all have levels of debt to GDP close to double that of Australia . <p> Even then , one of the often overlooked issues with debt is not just the amount , but also the purpose investment in infrastructure or early childhood education is better debt than borrowing to meet growing public sector salaries . <p> The facts suggest we are wealthy , so why do so many Australians feel poor ? <p> According to the MLC funded IPSOS conducted research published in the 2016 report Australia Today , 69 percent of Australians feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , while others do n't feel they 're " rich enough " . <p> Close to 50 per cent of us believe you need over $150,000 in income to live comfortably in Australia . <p> Most Australians think being a millionaire no longer means you are rich . <p> When Australians talk about achieving a comfortable lifestyle : eating out in restaurants ; annual international holidays ; paying private school fees ; having a nice car ; and living in a nice house are all on most people 's list of requirements . <p> One of the interesting findings about perceptions of wealth is that the more we have , the more we want . Thirty three percent of people earning $40 to $69,000 per year aspire to greater wealth , 45 per cent of people earning $70 to $99,000 , 55 per cent earning $100 to $149,000 , and 71 per cent of people earning $150,000 admit to wanting more . <p> Australia is a wealthy nation . Most of us are rich , comparatively speaking . Most of us lead very comfortable lives . <p> The uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needy people in Australia , most of us consider being able to buy what we want when we want to as the measure of our economic circumstances . If $1 million does n't make us feel rich , will $2 million ? <p> The second flaw in the tough times argument is that if politicians were serious about making savings , there are many areas of expenditure that could come under the microscope for cuts well before we target the most vulnerable . <p> I still find it incomprehensible that the government provide the 3,000 or so anonymous pharmacy owners that belong to the Pharmacy Guild with over $4 billion a year on top of their Medicare payments , while preventing any competition and locking in location rules , most of which work against increasing accessibility to drugs . Freeing up the retail supply of pharmaceuticals would improve health and reduce costs . <p> We provide businesses with over $5 billion in fuel tax credits , $2 billion of which goes to the mining industry . <p> We provide billions of dollars in tax exemptions for high income earners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing examples ripe for review like the tax avoidance involved in family trusts , licensed clubs ( income exempt ) , the cash economy , etc . I am sure many readers might have their own lists . <p> I could also provide a list of measures that Australia should be considering , especially if we think our economic circumstances really do require tough measures . For instance , Australia is almost unique amongst comparable OECD countries in not having any form of death duty on the wealthy ( thanks to Joh Bjelke Petersen ) . Even if the cut-in point was $5 million in wealth and the rate was relatively low , such a duty would not only raise hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue , but also significantly increase philanthropy ( as it does in the US , Canada and the UK ) . <p> The tough times line has become a political argument rather than a description of our economic circumstances , and that is not surprising because federal budgets are more about politics than our economy . Federal budgets tell us who is politically powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor in Africa are not . We cut foreign aid , but not protections and industry assistance for pharmacy owners . The mining industry is politically powerful , unemployed Indigenous young people are not . We cut support programs for Indigenous youth as their suicide and incarceration rates soar , but not the fuel subsidies for the mining industry . <p> Charities could be politically powerful , but most are not . <p> As the tough times rhetoric increases , and the government positions itself as a warrior for economic responsibility , concerned charities should understand that this discourse is not about our economy , but about politics . <p> This is why our advocacy for the vulnerable , our push to achieve the " Australia We Want " , is never more important than during the federal budget process . <p> About the author : David Crosbie is CEO of the Community Council for Australia .

 <p> Rothbard and co-author Olivia Amanda O'Neill , a management professor at George Mason University , conducted a qualitative study of fire stations in metropolitan areas and found that the most fulfilling workplaces were both compassionate ( having the " love " culture ) and convivial . <p> " We wanted to go in and understand how the emotional culture of an organisation could affect how people both interact in the workplace , but also what the effects on them physiologically might be , " Rothbard said in a podcast about her research . <p> " We were really interested in looking at emotional culture , in particular the culture of love , as well as another particular type of culture that often emerges in organisations , especially masculine organisations , which is called ' culture of joviality ' . <p> " A culture of joviality is sort of the fun , the joking , the pranks , kind of a macho , back slapping , teasing type of a culture . A culture of companionate love is really one where there is a sense of compassion , caring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about looking at this question in the context of firefighters is that this is a really extreme setting to think about the question of love . There 's a little bit of past research that 's looked at a culture of compassionate love , and that has looked at mostly health care settings and other kinds of organisational settings where it might be more expected , whereas we really wanted to look at an extreme case to see whether love matters and is love evident in these masculine organisations ? " <p> Rothbard said her research found that love does matter , but some other things matter , too . <p> " There was something about being in a culture where you were able to both joke around but also get the feelings of compassion and caring ... that really tempered each other , " she said . <p> The study also looked at the culture at individual workplaces . <p> " One of the themes that emerged was this culture of joviality that we expected the pranks , the humor , all of the kind of fun things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stress . But the second emotional theme that emerged around culture was this theme of compassionate love , " Rothbard said . <p> " Another way to think about compassionate love is brotherly love . It 's not romantic love ; it 's giving each other a hug if something tough has come up , making sure that you are there for each other , that you know each other deeply and show that you care about one another . Sometimes , that can be in small acts , like washing the dishes or making sure that you have somebody 's favorite snack in the kitchen . There 's a lot of camaraderie and brotherly love that we also saw at some of these fire stations . <p> " What 's really interesting about this study to me is that we looked at firefighters as an extreme case of masculine organisations , but this really can apply to lots of different organisations . It can apply to all sorts of settings where the norms are really masculine in terms of the dominant expected behavior . <p> " It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firefighters , but we see these same types of behaviors in lots of different occupational settings . " <p> The research also offered ways of diagnosing any workplace culture . <p> " First of all , you have to be willing to look and be open to what you find . When you think about emotional culture , there are signs all around us . There are artifacts , statements , stories that people tell that you can use to really diagnose culture and understand it . With culture and joviality , the thing that you want to look for as a manager is , is it going too far ? The teasing and the pranks may be very fun , high energy , high octane , but is that going too far ? That 's the thing you worry about with a culture of joviality , right ? Is it crossing the line to bullying or harassment ? That 's what you do n't want as a manager , " Rothbard said . <p> " With a culture of compassionate love , what you want to know are things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they checking in when somebody is sick ? Are they making sure that they know how things are going with a particular individual ? <p> " As a manager , you can model that behavior . If your employee is out sick for a couple of days , you can send them a note or give them a phone call and say : ' Hey , just thinking of you . How are you doing ? Is there anything I can do to help ? ' Those kinds of things really help to model a culture of love where people feel like others are looking out for them , that they care about them and that they matter in that organisation . <p> " I think it 's not as hard as it might seem to model those things and to check to see whether you have a culture of joviality in addition to a culture of love .

 <h> Family Rejection Major Cause of LGBTI Homelessness -- Report <p> Family rejection is a major driver of homelessness for LGBTI people , leading to them become homeless at a younger age with a greater reliance on friends rather than family for support , according to a new draft report . <p> Family rejection is a major driver of homelessness for LGBTI people , leading to them become homeless at a younger age with a greater reliance on friends rather than family for support , according to a new draft report . <p> The stage one report , called Journeys Home , found that while the pathways to homelessness were very similar amongst all agencies ' clients , including family violence , mental health issues , substance abuse and financial stress , they were made more complex for LGBTI clients by the impact of discrimination and/or family rejection . <p> The philanthropically funded research pointed to community attitudes and ill-equipped service providers as adding to the factors around homelessness . <p> The project director from Melbourne University is Associate Professor Ruth McNair , who is a general practitioner , co-chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chair of the Gay and Lesbian Foundation of Australia ( GALFA ) , and founding member of the Rainbow Families Council and the Australian Lesbian Medical Association . <p> McNair told Pro Bono News that while anecdotal evidence suggested that family rejection was a major issue for LGBTI people the research had confirmed it and also showed the differences within these groups . <p> " It is much clearer that the trans and gender diverse people seem to have experienced rejection earlier even that of lesbian , gay and bisexual people , " McNair said . <p> " Intriguingly the bisexuals are also earlier in becoming homeless than the gay and lesbian groups . We still have to unpack this evidence but it appears they are homeless younger on average than anyone else . <p> " There is a big piece to be done on community and family education . It is largely about that families do n't understand it at all . Sexual orientation for most parents , well they get it , but with trans issues they just do n't often believe their kids or go a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " For many of these trans young people the rejection is not only of the person themselves but their identity . They feel like they have nowhere to go . There is no safe haven if you like . " <p> McNair said homeless services had also witnessed this complexity , particularly among trans clients , with a pattern of repeated episodes of homelessness . <p> " Service providers had a much greater awareness of the trans and gender diverse clients than the LGB clients , probably due to the physical appearance of trans clients . They were correctly aware that bisexual clients in particular are likely to be invisible in the services , " she said . <p> " We found important ' within group ' differences between lesbian and gay and then bisexual people , which warrants further investigation . For example , bisexuals were at greater risk than LG people on a number of levels including greater experience of family violence , and they had higher substance use and disability . <p> " Lesbian women were more likely to have experienced barriers to accessing welfare services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , while men were more likely to use emergency services . " <p> McNair said while there was a growing awareness of the LGBT client group there was a general ignorance regarding their specific needs . <p> " The lack of knowledge on how to provide an inclusive service for these clients was striking , " she said . <p> The report said there were also examples of discrimination within the housing sector such as by real estate agents , landlords , other residents in shared houses and rooming houses , particularly for trans people . <p> The report said these intersecting drivers were seen to lead to a cycle of recurrent homelessness that was worse for LGBT people . <p> However , McNair said there was also a deal of goodwill to become more inclusive . <p> Stage one of the report made several recommendations : <p> LGBTI inclusive practice guidelines for the housing and homelessness sectors . Data collection that includes sex , sexual orientation and gender identity , and is linked with the service funding agreements . <p> Mandatory training on LGBTI for all services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their recommendation for all family violence services to undertake training to achieve a " rainbow tick " accreditation . <p> Development of a LGBTI safe housing network , including a possible single statewide LGBTI entry point for homelessness services . <p> Housing policy in Victoria to be LGBTI inclusive . <p> In reference to the inclusive practice guidelines McNair said they were in discussions with Homelessness Australia . <p> " There have n't been any guidelines like this yet in Australia , " she said . <p> " We are in discussions with Homelessness Australia about this and we have worked up a project plan to develop nationally acceptable guidelines . We are going to have slightly different guidelines for the homelessness sector and for housing because there are different messages . " <p> She said in terms of having mandatory training , there was a big piece to be done around supporting estate agents and social housing groups who advocate for this population . <p> " There is a lot of unconscious bias that we hear from clients around them feeling like they are at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> McNair said the idea for a LGBTI safe housing network would be to get a central organising point . <p> " So if a person is identifying as being LGBT or I and finding it difficult to find a homelessness service or a house to rent then your central point would be a way to coordinate that , " she said . <p> " Who is a friendly real estate agent out there who might be in your area , or which social housing service has done training and which has n't ? We would have the capacity to say these people have been trained and are a step up from those who have no idea . " <p> She said the homelessness sector was primed for action . <p> " They have started seeing so many clients who are LGB and trans and so we have been training up more organisations , " McNair said . <p> " They are saying : ' We want to know how to react . ' There are definitely the old hangers-on to the old idea of treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : ' We have got to know how to deal with these issues and finance it properly and know how to assess which gender service these people can go into . ' <p> " The big piece is how to support ' families of origin ' . The huge driver is family disruption and services are saying the best place for these young people is back at home but there is a big problem there . How can the service advocate for family support and family therapy . " <p> McNair said the final report was due in August . <p> " The guidelines project will happen from July to December and we will have them ready by early next year , " she said . <p> " We are still collecting data and we are still doing interviews . Out of all this will come our formal mechanism and policies around data collection and funding streams . " <p> She said the team was working with Homelessness Australia to produce national guidelines and with Swinburne University on the data analysis . 
 <p> Calls for Action as Youth Mental Illness on the , 19th April 2017 at 7:00 am <p> More young Australians are in psychological distress than five years ago , according to new research which has prompted calls from not for profits for urgent action to stem rising youth mental illness . <p> A joint report , released on Wednesday by Mission Australia and Black Dog Institute , has presented the findings of five years of mental-health data collected from young Australians offering insights into their levels of psychological distress , their concerns and where they go to for help . <p> It revealed nearly one in four young people between the ages of 15 and 19 in 2016 met the criteria for probable serious mental illness , with young females twice as likely as males to report high psychological distress . <p> Mission Australia CEO Catherine Yeomans said the findings were alarming . <p> " There are a number of measures that actually show us that we should sit up and pay attention to what the young people are telling us , because this is not the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yeomans told Pro Bono News . <p> " Adolescence comes with its own set of challenges for young people . But we are talking about an alarming number of young people facing serious mental illness ; often in silence and without accessing the help they need . <p> " The effects of mental illness at such a young age can be debilitating and incredibly harmful to an individual 's quality of life , academic achievement , and social participation both in the short term and long term . " <p> Yeomans said it was particularly concerning to see the burden of probable serious mental illness was borne more heavily by young females than young males . <p> " Young females , who responded to this , are answering in such a way as to identify probable serious mental illness at double the rates of young men and in fact those rates have increased significantly over the last five years as well , " she said . <p> According to the research the top issues of concern for those with a probable serious mental illness were coping with stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report found that friends , parents and the internet played an important role as sources of help for young people with a probable serious mental illness . <p> Black Dog Institute director Professor Helen Christensen said the fact young people were turning to the internet as a source of help pointed to prevailing stigma . <p> " This report shows that young people who need help are seeking it reluctantly , with a fear of being judged continuing to inhibit help-seeking , " Christensen said . <p> " Yet evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs are vital in reducing the risk of an adolescent developing a serious and debilitating mental illness in their lifetime . We need to take urgent action to turn this rising tide of mental illness . <p> " We know that young people are turning to the internet for answers and our research at Black Dog Institute clearly indicates that self-guided , online psychological therapy can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety . " <p> Christensen said while technology could be a lifeline , e-mental health interventions must be evidence-based and tailored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment is needed to drive a proactive and united approach to delivering new mental health programs which resonate with young people , and to better integrate these initiatives across schools and the health system to help young people on a path to a mentally healthier future , " she said . <p> The report made several key policy recommendations based on the findings : <p> Schools should provide evidence-based universal mental health prevention and intervention programs for young people.This will require additional government funding for schools to resource these programs . <p> Technology that provides an alternative to face to face service delivery should be supported and invested in to meet the mental health needs of young people . <p> Friends and family need to be equipped to provide support to young people when they seek help in relation to their mental health . Peer support networks and peer education initiatives should also be utilised . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people need access to culturally sensitive and age appropriate mental health services that are close to their homes . Intergenerational disadvantage must also be addressed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A gendered approach to the mental health of young people is required that takes into account help seeking preferences as well as other social pressures such as gender-based discrimination and ideals of appearance . <p> Young people should be engaged in designing youth-friendly mental health services and as advocates on important mental health issues . Young people experiencing mental illness should be recognised as experts in their own lives . <p> Yeomans said the mental health of the younger generation could continue to deteriorate without extra support and resources , including investment in more universal , evidence-based mental health programs in schools and greater community acceptance . <p> " Given these concerning findings , I urge governments to consider how they can make a major investment in supporting youth mental health to reduce these alarming figures , " Yeomans said . <p> " We need to ensure young people have the resources they need to manage mental health difficulties , whether it is for themselves or for their peers . <p> " Parents , schools and community all play a vital role and we must fully equip them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people . " <p> Yeomans encouraged young people to have their say and complete this year 's Mission Australia 's Youth Survey . <p> " These findings come over five years and in that five year time frame , we had in 2012 over 15,000 young people responding to the survey , last year 's survey there were 22,000 young people . Now the fact that the number of young people identifying a probable serious mental illness has actually increased in that time , even with increased responses , really tells us what young people are experiencing " she said . <p> " So the youth survey is open again this year . We really encourage even more young people to be responding to our survey . <p> " We are using this in our advocacy , we are taking all of these findings to policy advisors and government officials and we are sharing these results with schools and other community organisations as well so young people can really feel like their voices are heard .

 <h> NFPs To Learn Art of Online Storytelling <p> Honest and authentic storytelling is the key to engagement , according to social media expert Nick Bowditch who is set to give the keynote speech at a free event helping not for profits use compelling stories to grow awareness , raise funds , and attract the right people . <p> NFPs To Learn Art of Online , 19th April 2017 at 4:37 pm <p> Honest and authentic storytelling is the key to engagement , according to social media expert Nick Bowditch who is set to give the keynote speech at a free event helping not for profits use compelling stories to grow awareness , raise funds , and attract the right people . <p> Change the World , which will be held in Sydney on 9 May , aims to give not for profits an opportunity to learn from changemakers and entrepreneurs on how to marry online marketing and compelling stories and ensure their story stands out in a competitive marketplace . <p> Bowditch , who is " the only person in the southern hemisphere to have worked for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of charities struggle with storytelling . <p> " A lot of the time , people who work in charities have really , really great stories , and people want to support them but they struggle a little bit with the actual storytelling part of it , " Bowditch said . <p> " So what my session aims to do is show them ways that I tell my own story . <p> " So the majority of the speaking and writing that I do is about my own life with mental illness and the way that I deal with a life around depression and anxiety and PTSD which I live with . <p> " A lot of that comes easier when you are just open and transparent and as honest as you are comfortable being . <p> Nick Bowditch <p> Bowditch , who released a book last year about his journey with what he calls his " mental uniqueness " , said he was a " big believer " in being open . <p> " Sometimes people working for not for profits ca n't tell authentic stories because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of their clients and there are things that people do n't want to say . But I am a big believer in being as open as you are comfortable , because then people engage better with your story , " he said . <p> " It is funny because some of the people who came to the Perth event were telling me one-on-one , ' here is my story ' or ' this is the story of my foundation ' , and I was like ' oh my god , that is a fantastic story , where can I read this ? ' and they were like ' oh no , I do n't want to tell anyone ' . <p> " I think , oh geez well no one is going to give you any money . One of the biggest problems with charities in Australia is they have got no money and they wo n't ask for any . " <p> He said not for profits needed to learn how to tell the right story to the right people at the right time . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " I think if I was going to make a sweeping generalisation , the majority of not-for-profit businesses in Australia are n't getting the maximum out of what they could be doing , online , digitally and on social media . <p> " They say ' I 've got this Facebook page ' and they just kind of spew everything out at once , or they do n't really tell the right story to the right people , and a lot of my instructions with these guys and in particular with this event will be around what platforms to use to reach the right people with the right message at the right time . " <p> In particular Bowditch offered three tips to help not for profits stand out . <p> " There is a lot of content out there . Everyone has become a publisher , everyone is an author , everyone is an expert , everyone is a journalist , " he said . <p> " So my three biggest tips I guess would be to utilise video as much as you can . Humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at pretty pictures and we like watching videos . That 's the first thing . <p> " The second thing is go fishing where the fish are . I think that is a simple kind of marketing ideology that works for not for profit as well as profit . If the majority of people who are likely to support your story or engage with your foundation are on Twitter then that 's where you should spend the majority of your time , or YouTube of Facebook or whatever . <p> " The last one is the most important one I think . It is just speak as open and as transparent and as authentically as possible . When I say possible , sometimes you can translate that to as comfortable as you are willing to be . Or sometimes you are not telling your own story so there is situations around that . But the more authentic and open and transparent your story is , the more engaged , as well as comfortable , people are with both hearing your story and supporting your work . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event in Sydney , which was created and organised by Hancock Creative and builds on the inaugural Change the World Perth event in 2016 . <p> " I was part of the inaugural Change the World in Perth , so when I heard Hancock Creative were bringing the event to Sydney I was so keen to be part of it , " he said . <p> " I have a passion for authentic storytelling and the atmosphere last year was amazing . Having so many worthy causes and not-for-profits in one room was electric . I do a lot of work with charities and causes that it was a natural fit with me ; I 'm so excited to be involved again . " <p> Bowditch will be joined by The Entourage founder and CEO Jack Delosa and Rebecca Chua from social enterprise Thankyou , who will also share their online marketing secrets . <p> Director of Hancock Creative , Alecia Hancock , said it was the " perfect event for people who want to make a real difference in the world or their communities " . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for profits and charities to attend , as well as entrepreneurs and forward-thinking businesses and corporates who want to learn new ways they can make a difference , " Hancock said . <p> Chua said she would be talking about evolving marketing trends and instinctual marketing . <p> " It 's an honour to share the Thankyou journey , ups and downs and most importantly , lessons we 've picked up along the way ( and are still learning ) , with people making amazing change in the word , " Chua said . <p> " I 'll be talking about how to think differently , as well as create buzz and word-of-mouth that gets audiences fired up and supporting a campaign . " <p> Delosa said he would be addressing how not for profits can unite their teams to drive their vision forward . <p> " Those who are able to achieve great things have developed the ability to touch the hearts and minds of people around them , " Delosa said . <p> " If you want your vision to travel , just believing in it yourself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unify people around a common purpose , so that you are all collectively working towards it . " <p> Change the World will take place at The Entourage Development Centre in Sydney on 9 May . 
 <p> The adoption of integrated reporting , or IR , by corporates can be challenging but generates tangible organisational , reputational and commercial benefits , according to a new analysis . <p> The Insights into Integrated Reporting report , published by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants ( ACCA ) , reviewed 41 corporate reports from around the world , with one of the main reviewers being Professor Marvin Wee of the University of Western Australia . <p> According to the IR framework : " An integrated report should disclose information about matters that substantively affect the organisation 's ability to create value over the short , medium and long term . " <p> The review found that reporting quality was high across IR participants , and delivered several common benefits including : more integrated thinking and management , greater clarity on business issues and performance , improved corporate reputation and stakeholder relationships , more efficient reporting , employee engagement and improved gross margins . <p> However , the report also identified several areas where reporting could be improved : <p> Value creation : widespread challenges in identifying and articulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Connectivity : companies identified this as one of the biggest challenges with implementing IR . It required breaking down silos within the organisation and changing existing data collection processes . <p> Defining performance measures : thinking and practice was still immature in articulating the value organisations derive from non-financial capitals . <p> Materiality : companies found it challenging to reconcile the needs of different stakeholders . Improving the materiality determination process could help drive improvements in conciseness , completeness and reliability . <p> Conciseness : nearly half of the integrated reports reviewed ran over 150 pages . Companies found it difficult to reconcile conciseness and meaningful communication with stakeholders . <p> Reliability and completeness : the reviewers felt that only 51 per cent of the reports reviewed achieved a balance of good and bad news in equal measure . Companies need to know what " good reporting " looks like , before they can implement internal control processes and consider external assurance on their integrated report . <p> Manager of corporate reporting at ACCA , Chen said reviewing the corporate reports produced by companies " leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the progress made on IR adoption . <p> " The aim of integrated reporting -- through integrated thinking -- is to create a more stable and sustainable global economy , by encouraging companies to think about how they do business in a more holistic and forward-looking way . In today 's volatile environment , this vision is as pertinent as ever , " Chen said . <p> " Our research has found passionate support for the aims of IR among business leaders , but it has also pinpointed specific barriers to better reporting . " <p> CEO of the International Integrated Reporting Council Richard Howitt said : " As the uptake of integrated reporting continues to grow across the world , this study shows there is equal effort put into raising the quality of integrated reports as well as the number . <p> " It is also shows the concrete advantages not simply of companies undertaking integrated reporting but of their joining the international IR business network , to learn with others and to be global advocates for change . " <p> Chief executive of ACCA Helen Brand said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year , this new report explores the progress pioneering adopters have made -- what they have learnt , the challenges they have faced , and the organisational value they 've gained . <p> " It 's clear from this report 's findings that integrated reporting is enabling a range of companies to articulate more clearly and fully what truly drives them forward . This , in turn , is leading to greater clarity on , and management of , challenges and opportunities . In essence , integrated reporting is a means to an end , rather than end in itself -- and that final destination is integrated thinking . <p> " Stakeholders rightly expect today 's organisations to safeguard all forms of capital -- financial , natural , human , intellectual and social -- and so wider forms of corporate stewardship have never been more important . Only by adopting this approach can we instil the public trust and confidence that is so vitally important to the health of the global economy . " 
 <h> Online Tool to Measure Value of CSR and NFP Work <p> The way Australian businesses measure the impact of their CSR strategies and charities measure their social outcomes will have a broader focus in 2017 with the launch of the Australian Social Value Bank ( ASVB ) online tool . <p> Online Tool to Measure Value of CSR and NFP , 20th April 2017 at 4:10 pm <p> The way Australian businesses measure the impact of their CSR strategies and charities measure their social outcomes will have a broader focus in 2017 with the launch of the Australian Social Value Bank ( ASVB ) online tool . <p> Based on a UK model of social impact measurement , the ASVB aims to simplify the process of valuing social impact services and programs , allowing government , businesses , philanthropic and not-for-profit organisations to demonstrate their social impact . <p> Project manager of the ASVB Min Seto said the tool was timely because of increasingly limited resources and bigger demands for social return on investment now being the norm . <p> " The funding of social services is changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment from sources other than government , while businesses and governments are looking to get the best use of their procurement dollar , " Seto said . <p> Daniel Fujiwara , the founding director of which helped design the tool , told Pro Bono News that the ASVB was the largest model of its kind in the world . <p> " It 's the largest collection of social values in Australia and it is the first of its kind to measure both primary and secondary benefits , " Fujiwara said . <p> " For the first time , organisations will be able to compare the value of different interventions , so that they can decide where to focus their efforts . <p> " Unlike other social impact models , the ASVB can measure the value created for individuals , such as an increased sense of safety , improved job readiness and improved overall health , as well as the benefits for secondary parties including government , such as cost savings to the state . " <p> He said in essence it was " a user-friendly tool " where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficiaries of their interventions . <p> " For example if you had an organisation that offered smoking cessation advice or programs , they would collect data about how many participants were on that program and how many people they observed who had stopped smoking and then information within the model would allow us to predict the overall value to society , " he said . <p> " It accounts for things such as impact on the government side , which is the potential reduction in medical care also the benefits for individuals which is improvement in health , better physical condition and those kind of elements which are all compared back to the program . It allows you to look at for every dollar you spend on a program how much social value is created . <p> " It 's far bigger than the UK version of it and it 's all based on Australian data sets . We used two surveys from the University of Melbourne and we also used a large number of government administrative surveys and data sets . So it is very specific to Australia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we expect in Australia is that the corporates would fund charity A and charity B and those two charities would use the social value bank to measure outcomes and ... both organisations would get an overall estimate of the amount of social impact created for every dollar spent . Charity A might come back with a value of $4 for every $1 spent and charity B might come back for a figure of $7 for every $1 . " <p> He said funding corporates would be able to understand the value that each of the charities were creating and could potentially start to think about how they allocated funding or prioritised funding in the future . <p> " We have 60 social impact values included in the ASVB 's first release , measuring outcomes in the social and community , home , health , employment , education and crime spaces , but plans are in place to add more values over time , " he said . <p> " This is good news for the government in particular , helping ease the pressures surrounding budgets and the allocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a global leader in policy evaluation , social impact measurement and non-market valuation methods , will be in Australia later this month for the beta-testing process and training session with selected organisations ahead of the official release in mid-2017 . <p> He said businesses with less than $1.5 million turnover could apply for a subsidy to use the tool and not-for-profit organisations with less than $1.5 million could apply for a grant to access the ASVB tool for free . Pricing is on a sliding scale depending on annual revenue for large organisations . 
 <p> Coding the Future of Vocational TrainingFriday , 21st April 2017 at 2:08 pm <p> A new Queensland-based not for profit that teaches vocational coding skills to adults for free is hoping to " totally change " the vocational sector . <p> IT etc.Training was launched in February by Brendan Kelly and Paul Buckby with the aim of providing people with the opportunity to learn quality , industry relevant coding skills to enable them to participate in the " digital revolution " . <p> The program uses a challenge-based cooperative learning style and has eliminated entry requirements in a bid to remove barriers that restrict access to traditional education . <p> Kelly , who previously worked with Buckby at TAFE Brisbane and Careers Australia , told Pro Bono News it was a grassroots program making " a life-changing difference to people 's lives , in a time where other educational institutions were in the news for all the wrong reasons " . <p> " I worked for TAFE for about 10 years , and Paul for about 25 I think , teaching IT so generally programming and database stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little bit and then got out ... we were basically pretty disillusioned with the whole way that that sector was going both in the quality of the education and also the cost of the education , " Kelly said . <p> " What used to happen with Careers Australia was students would come in , they would register for the course , it would cost them about $20,000-plus in VET FEE-HELP loans and they would find that they were n't suited to coding , or they did n't like the course , but they were saddled with that debt . <p> " So we always had in our minds , setting up something where people could come and learn coding for free . " <p> The course , which is run on Saturdays out of the State Library of Queensland , teaches students skills to code mobile apps , dynamic web sites or traditional desktop applications . <p> The first course in February offered 30 students an eight-week challenge to learn to code . The program is now set to launch two further coding challenges with more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waiting list . <p> Kelly said their strong numbers indicated an enthusiasm in the community for this type of program with people wanting to re-skill themselves in disciplines like software development in light of the uncertain future of many jobs . <p> " We were reading reports like the CEDA report , where people that are in jobs at the moment those jobs possibly are n't going to exist in the next five or 10 years so they were the ones that initially we were targeting , or thinking about targeting , " he said . <p> " We run our course on the weekends , on Saturday , so if they were working full time they could work towards a career change without disrupting their work . " <p> Kelly said two-thirds of the participants were female which was " rare , if not unheard of " in software development courses . <p> He said the program was also using " robots " to reach out to remote students . <p> " The state library has acquired a , which is a telepresence robot , " Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ipad on a stick on wheels , so the user controls them from wherever they are and the robot has an image of the user on the ipad and then they can control that and talk and people can talk to the robot . <p> " We have got a remote student that ... lives in Moranbah , and she 's going to be doing our course as a robot . <p> " So it is really exciting . " <p> He said the could change the future of online learning . <p> " To do the course nationally , I 'd like to be based in each of the capital cities , but with the robotic thing I think that 's where we can make regional education , economically viable , " he said . <p> " The libraries in regional areas are like the hub where a lot of people can go and we want to be able to use these robots so that we can take our course out to those regional areas as well . <p> " I guess we 've seen , working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vocational training talk about online learning but I think it is just a convenience for the industry . <p> " For the students , very few people can successfully do online learning because they are isolated , and even if they can chat or whatever else , it is not the same as being part of a group and so only a very small percentage of people that undertake online training ever complete it . <p> " We think that these little things are probably the future because people can feel part of a group . So it is probably the next best thing to being able to come into class , you can actually be there from wherever you are and interact with people . <p> " We 've got some Indigenous students , that is another area that we would like to help with , and obviously a lot of that is going to be remote as well . " <p> Up to this stage Kelly and Buckby have been donating their time for free and relying on the state library to give them a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the program . <p> " Basically Paul and I have just donated our time and money for free up to this point as I guess we wanted to prove the model , which I think we have already done just in the one challenge , " he said . <p> " We want to get industry involved with it , so industry can work with the students and they get experience working with industry people , which they do n't with traditional education . <p> " A lot of people do like a diploma in software development but they never have any idea of what is it like to work in the industry and so we saw that as being really important . <p> " I guess that 's where our focus is going to be now . We 'll be looking initially for industry to get involved , because that is a big part of the education that we want to provide , and then ... the government ... keep talking about innovation and coding , so we hope to get some funding from them . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think it is being irrevocably damaged and we believe our model is possibly the future of vocational training , " he said . <p> " I guess I just have this vision in my head of how everyone is going to be doing vocational training , and it 's going to be free and companies are going to be highly involved in it , and it is going to be relevant . " <p> Kelly said coding was vital for Australia 's future workforce . <p> " More and more , everything is being controlled by apps and everything is being digitised and it is all about big data and software development and coding is at the core of all that , " he said . <p> " They talk about the innovation revolution but ... the only people that are really in a position to take advantage of that innovation revolution are people with coding skills and with those technical skills , and most of the population do n't have those skills . <p> " We want to enable or empower a huge number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 
 <p> Farming Co-op Planting New Ideas for , 26th April 2017 at 8:40 am <p> The future of organic farming could be cooperative with a new organisation entering the space to shake things up , writes Wendy Williams in this week 's Spotlight on Social Enterprise . <p> Everyday Australians are being given a chance to invest in organic and ecological farms across Australia with a new organisation poised to turn the cooperative industry on its head . <p> The Organic &amp; Regenerative Investment Co-operative ( ) , which launched this month via a membership drive and Pozible crowdfunding campaign , is the first of its kind in Australia . <p> It aims to provide a vehicle for companies and people to invest directly in successful organic farms and businesses and allow aspiring farmers to get farming without needing millions of dollars . <p> founder and director Carolyn Suggate told Pro Bono News the co-op will be a model for other groups , and will help farmers with their succession planning over the long term . <p> " Our intention is for organic farms to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm managers can come and go , but the entity is secured for longevity , with Australian ownership and long-term benefit , " Suggate says . <p> " One of the biggest factors in organics is about preservation and restoration rather than profit extraction and so that 's why a co-op structure is more suitable . <p> " For retiring farmers it is a structure to allow them to step back and leave equity and invest into a cooperative structure , that offers them a secure exit in a timely manner . <p> " Their children can lease the farm from the co-op , but if something happens on either end of that arrangement , both the investors and the managers are protected through the mechanism of the co-op . It means people can step back and young farmers can get in without massive risk from either side . " <p> She says she was motivated to learn about new ways of doing business to limit the land being sold to foreign investors . <p> " I can see , coming from a farming background , the way that farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we are going to sell a huge amount of our land to overseas investors and for me I do n't want to see that happen in my lifetime , " she says . <p> " I 've actually participated in that and I 've been part of that and one of the reasons I actually left the industry was I do n't want the majority of our land owned by foreign investors . <p> " I think this mechanism enables them to invest but it does n't give the control of the asset to the investors , that 's the difference . We absolutely value and welcome their investment but it does n't mean that they own 80 per cent of an asset and they can just flick it off and sell it back to their own governments . " <p> According to the founders of , the organic sector is currently experiencing exponential growth but is stifled by lack of security , supply and investment . <p> They say investors are keen to be involved in the sector , but given it 's lack of scale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> says she spent five years exploring different ways of looking after financial returns at the same time as looking after the land . <p> " I was very disillusioned and still am , with how superfunds are not investing into agriculture and they 're basically about extracting profit and return , and I guess I believe that Australian money should be investing into the land that is feeding our country , " she says . <p> " So I come from quite a deep place in that sort of way and I have spent five years exploring different ways that we could achieve a number of different parameters about food security , about land security and also about fair return for investment . Because investors need to be able to get a return , but how much control should investors have versus the actual security and longevity of the land . <p> " I guess I have done a full circle in terms of looking at setting up a fund and looking at the whole investment world and going , I actually do n't think that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landholders to have much right or much say , as you can see from those examples where they pull the trigger and suddenly they are liquidating assets that were meant to be 20 year assets . " <p> She says their model is unique in promoting a horizontal type of management . <p> " The cooperative industry in Australia has been around a very long time and there are some really good examples and unfortunately like with anything , there has been some really bad examples as well , " she says . <p> " And so we obviously want to create a model that is about collaboration and about member engagement and really horizontal types of management rather than demutualising and selling off a portion of it , being taken over , which is what a lot of people reflect when they think of cooperatives . " <p> says it has been challenging to get people 's heads around how it works . <p> " We 've got some really good tech people working on a website that is going to go live in a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as members to be part of our journey and it is not like : ' Come and invest us and let us manage all your money . ' It is : ' Come and be part of what we 're doing and actually contribute to what you think we should be looking at and investing in ' , " she says . <p> " So some of our members for example can bring investment proposals to the cooperative and say : ' We live in this community , this region has got this farm which is going to go on the market , can we look at that ? ' And that is totally possible for it to happen this way . <p> " For some people the process is really new . So for some of our farming members , I must say it is a bit of a learning curve for them because they 're not used to communicating in that kind of way . <p> " I guess we 're not like a normal cooperative in that we 're not in one town . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome some of those barriers in the sense of , I do n't sit in the cafe with you and talk to you , I actually just have to see what you write online and then respond to that in that way . " <p> She says the co-op has already attracted a good mix of members from " hardcore farmers to passionate organic people who want to be able to buy organic food more readily " , to people interested in the cooperative model . <p> " Anyone is welcome to become a member , and by becoming a member you actually become one of the participants of our learning journey , " she says . <p> " And the cooperative side of things , is for me really exciting because it is actually helping people to understand and we become a model for others to be able to emulate what we 're doing . <p> " So we 're really keen to be able to share our journey so that others can actually set up their own reflection of ours to be able to facilitate investment into areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money dumped in it , they need people to be engaged and really direct it . <p> " It is directed by the people . That 's what this is about . It is about where do we need to put investment into the organic industry that is going to make a good difference but is really going to be impactful and it is going to help education and collaboration among communities in regional areas . <p> " You ca n't just go and buy a massive beef farm in the middle of outback Queensland and think that that is going to make a big difference in terms of the community in Sydney or Melbourne who do n't have enough organic food right now . " <p> says the cooperative has the capacity to scale to any height . <p> " Our initial starting point is we are hoping to raise $5 million to $10 million for our first few farms , so we have got around three farms that we would like to secure to basically create and demonstrate the model , and then the cooperative actually has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . <p> " I fully expect it to be around the $50 million within a two year period . And so suddenly it becomes a really substantial entity that has all different types of farms , all managed by individuals . <p> " We do n't manage the farms , we just lease them to experienced farm managers and also , research facilities and organic businesses . There is a whole myriad of different sorts of investments that we 're looking at and what that does is create a really stable supply and it enables people to be part of a learning journey throughout that supply chain , so they are not just a farmer , they actually become the processor and the retailer and the marketer as well . " <p> says the Pozible campaign , which is aiming to raise $19,000 to go towards web development , investment analysis , marketing and consultants , is their " soft launch " . <p> " So we want to launch with specific investment opportunities for our members and for wholesale investors . So the Pozible campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <p> " We 've got a membership launch in the middle of May and so that will be a way that people can actually sit in the room and meet each other and network and understand our board . <p> " I just think it is a really new concept and so we are taking it not slowly , but really steady so people can get their heads around that this is a new way to do business . Not just from a management perspective but even from the type of investment we are looking for and the way that that return is reflected to our investors . <p> " It is about a capped return and then we 've also got a carbon component and we 've got the social component and the energy component . So we 've actually got different ways of measuring return on investment , it is not just about the financial return and that just all takes education and lots of it . " <p> She says they are turning the cooperative industry on its head . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have helped us on our journey , a lot through the Farming Together program , so that has been an incredible merit to us . But some of the lawyers in there have basically said we are turning the cooperative industry on its head because what we 're doing is actually moving away from the vertical model and saying we 're actually achieving a horizontal model , " she says . <p> " A lot of cooperatives are structured with a board and a CEO and the members are just kind of stuccoed there and they do n't actually have a lot of influence in terms of the actual cooperative which is not how they were meant to be structured in the beginning . <p> " If you look at Mondragon , and some of the really good cooperatives around the world they are very different to how cooperatives generally are structured in Australia ... which started based on the farmers needs but then they become about the big part of business and the big end of town and I guess , we are really striving to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Co-operative Capital Unit ) enable that to occur . They enable that engagement of investment with membership so suddenly your members are able to actively invest directly , rather than via the stock exchange which creates a whole world market , where the world market drops and suddenly the membership and the reason that it was actually formed in the first place is forgotten because of the risk of the world market . <p> " I understand there are seven cooperatives in Australia that have got CCUs as part of their constitution but very few of them are using it to raise ongoing capital . They might do like a fundraiser but then they 'll stop and that is all they 'll do . What we 're looking at doing is actually offering ongoing opportunities of different investment assets and that 's all done through the CCU offerings , very much like Community Shares in the UK . " <p> She says their journey includes a lot of firsts . <p> " We are creating an investment industry that has never been done before , we 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're working with people who have never been part of this kind of entity before . So in every way we are being pioneers , " she says . <p> " But I think at the same time , some of our board members are so , so passionate about it and I guess our philosophy is that will be it 's own filter . And it really is because we are saying , we 're not about profit extraction . In agriculture a lot of it is about profit extraction and ultimate selfish interest where you buy land , you take out the profit and then you leave . <p> " What we 're saying is we 're actually looking at holding land in perpetuity and taking a fair financial return out of that but we 're actually wanting to reinvest to build the carbon , to build the biodiversity and to build long-term security in those farms so they are not about flicking them off and extracting profit in 20 years time . " It is a whole different way of understanding but when you explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road because people either understand that and go ' I 'm absolutely onboard ' or they say : ' No I 'm about 12 per cent return from agriculture and thank you very much I 'm going to go to the other side of the room ' . And there are those people I can tell you . " 
 <p> A new interactive tool to help business , not for profits and government work through the shared value opportunities in social issues could " be the answer to some of the world 's curliest problems " . <p> The new book , SV GO , launched on Wednesday to coincide with the 2017 Shared Value Forum in Melbourne , provides a " how to " approach to solving some of the world 's biggest issues and offers a catalogue of projects that are " ready to go " . <p> Taking the top 10 ideas developed at last year 's forum , the book provides a framework to help teams combat issues such as heart disease , obesity , key worker housing , transport , aged care , loneliness , climate change , extreme weather , disaster recovery . <p> The ideas are all based on the Shared Value Worksheet , co-designed by Shared Value Project , IAG and Republic of Everyone . <p> Republic of Everyone founder and partner Ben Peacock told Pro Bono News it was based on " the idea on a page " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared value idea into a page , which starts with an SDG Sustainable Development Goal , works it 's way through to which target within that SDG you are seeking to improve or work upon , it then goes ' OK outline your idea in simple terms ' and asks you to consider the social and economic or business benefits you are going to get out of it , " Peacock said . <p> " But it also integrated one more piece which is the concept of collective impact . <p> " Shared value and collective impact are quite close cousins , so who else would you bring along as partners on this program to really make it work well ? And of course trying to think in terms of one business , one NGO , one government , but not restricted to , you can actually have one sector , one government department , one NGO sort of thing . <p> " So we developed that as this sort of one page template and it worked really well , we found , to be able to define an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem you are going to solve , you can then sit there with a piece of paper or the whiteboard and a team and go what if , what if , what if . <p> " Like any sort of template , it forces you to think your idea through a little bit . And bang if you can put your idea on a page , pretty quickly in about an hour essentially you can design an idea . And we thought this was pretty powerful stuff . " <p> The worksheet was launched at a workshop , run by Peacock and Ramana James from IAG , at last year 's Shared Value Forum , where they challenged around 20 groups of 10 to come up with solutions for different problems which were then voted on . <p> Peacock said there were some " really solid ideas " . <p> " We thought it was a bit of a waste , just to have that as great we ran a workshop in the shared value forum , " he said . <p> " So we decided to package it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 10 ideas waiting to be adopted . But also 10 thought-starters if you like , to make people realise that they may not want any of those 10 but they could do 10 themselves very quickly just using this sort of process . So it 's just trying to inspire people to get involved and get a project going in their own organisation . " <p> Peacock said shared value was still a new concept and tools such as this were important to inspire thought on how it could work . <p> " In a perfect world , I would love people to adopt the ideas and make them happen , that would be fantastic , that would be the ultimate crowdsourced idea , you got 200 people to help design it and then voted on it and somebody makes it happen , you go : ' Wow that would be amazing ' , " he said . <p> " Probably even bigger than that I 'd really love people to go : ' Geez this is a new way of looking at how fast and easy it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own creative open source thinking on how they do it . And sort of add to it . That is just our version from working in shared value for a few years , what do other people do ? Can we all learn from each other . " <p> He said in particular it would be good to see businesses adopting the tool . <p> " Inevitably , if you look at collective impact marrying in in some way , the best shared value stuff involves more than one organisation , " he said . <p> " It involves business , government and NGO classically . But if you were going to choose a lead , I would always choose business because they have the resources , both time and money and the discipline , to make something happen . <p> " I think if you want to change the world , NGO and government are already sort of working on that , it is business that has the real power to add a new level to what 's already happening out there in the world . <p> " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be relevant to an NGO to help them have a tool to approach central partners for themselves but if I was going to choose a target , I would really love to see adopt it , it would be business . " <p> Peacock said shared value gave organisations an opportunity to do business better . <p> " You know everybody cares , nobody wants to make the world a worse place but I think that people feel the need ... to leave their social and environmental beliefs at the door when they walk in sometimes , " he said . <p> " I think what this has done has given everybody in a business the right to say : ' Oh wow actually those things can help me do business better if I have those social beliefs . ' <p> " So it gives a very business focused approach at that board level , but it gives almost a right to bring that part of you to work as long as you can turn it into a business idea for everyone in an organisation . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to explore the theme Business Reimagined : Innovating Through Shared Value and will focus on the innovation required for companies to create successful shared value initiatives that benefit society and create economic returns . <p> The forum , which includes in-depth case studies , lab sessions and panel discussions , will also seek to address the innovation required to fund initiatives , the industries that can benefit and the role that government can play in supporting their development . <p> Shared Value Project executive director Helen Steel told Pro Bono News one of the aims of the conference was for it to not just be a talk fest but to inspire action and have something concrete at the end . <p> " It is important for us as the concept grows and the community builds that we are providing additional resources for the organisations who want to tackle social issues in a big way , " Steel said . <p> " I guess what we would like with SV GO is a tool that any practitioner , or student even , could use to think about how they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look to take on . <p> " The ideas could very well be something that a company or organisation decides to take on itself , or it could just be a source of inspiration and help an organisation go through a similar process in deciding what is the social issue that they potentially could , and should , be taking on . What are some of the ways that they can address some of those social issues . " <p> She said this type of thinking outside the box was really needed . <p> " If as a country , and across the globe , if we are really going to innovate to be sustainable and to change and adapt then it is this type of thinking that we are going to need to encourage more of to generate these really great ideas , " she said . <p> She said there was an increased awareness in business organisations as to the role they play in the communities in which they operate . <p> " I think that there is a genuine sense from organisations that they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that that is a growing sentiment among particularly big corporate companies . They are really genuine in how they are considering it , " she said . <p> She said she was pleased with the number of new organisations who were attending the forum . <p> " That is kind of exciting in itself , just broadening the audience that we are getting that outreach to , " she said . <p> " For us it is just continuing to build an ecosystem to have a community of practice that is really thriving in this field to continue to see more and more companies across Australia adapting the shared value principles and using it as part of their business strategies , that 's really the outcome that we 're looking for .

 <h> Review of Consumer Law Sees Charity Sector ' Fobbed Off ' <p> A coalition of not-for-profit organisations under the banner says the charity sector has been " fobbed off " and relegated to third position in any future reform priorities with the release of the long-awaited review of Australian consumer law ( ACL ) . <p> A coalition of not-for-profit organisations under the banner says the charity sector has been " fobbed off " and relegated to third position in any future reform priorities with the release of the long-awaited review of Australian consumer law ( ACL ) . <p> The ACL review was undertaken by Consumer Affairs Australia and New Zealand ( CAANZ ) in June 2015 . The interim report was released in October 2016 and identified options to improve the law 's efficiency and effectiveness including charity regulations . The final report was released last week . <p> However , the NFP campaign , led by Justice Connect and the Community Council of Australia ( CCA ) said the long-awaited report failed to address its concerns , instead suggesting there be future research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report concluded that : " Once sufficient time has elapsed , CAANZ will assess the effectiveness of that guidance and any relevant regulator actions . The project will also look at how this could inform whether any future reforms are needed to enable the sector to work more effectively to the benefit of the Australian community . CAANZ proposes to commence this assessment in 2019/20 . " <p> In the forward to the report chair and director of Consumer Affairs Victoria Simon Cohen said : " CAANZ acknowledges that aspects of the ACL need further consideration . An ambitious forward research program is proposed for areas such as unsolicited selling , digital products , services , unfair trading and fundraising . " <p> The campaign has argued that with seven different state and territory laws , any charities that aspired to collect Australia-wide , or even small groups using the internet to raise funds , must abide by a minefield of rules and regulations that add millions of dollars in unnecessary cost to the not-for-profit sector . <p> " We have been fobbed off because we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research to be done . There has already been endless research done . <p> " The problem has already been well documented and the solution is simple . " <p> Woodward said the coalition was ready to work with governments on the detail of the reform wording and any concerns . <p> " This is a report to ministers ... now it is up to ministers to consider it in the light of the strength of the submissions and the long-standing nature of this concern and recognise that this is not a small sector this is an absolutely crucial sector for Australia and it needs to have its concerns elevated and not pushed to priority number three , " she said . <p> " We would be urging ministers that they now have an opportunity to go further than this report does and the ball is in their court . <p> " There has been leadership from Victoria in this regard and we would urge other ministers to see that this is an opportunity to see that very small amendments and a small amount of work now and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be repealed . <p> " The risk of waiting longer is that there continues to be confusion and non compliance . " <p> Woodward acknowledged that fundraisers had come some way because in the initial discussion paper there was no mention of fundraising . <p> " Now at least we have been elevated to the report 's opening preface and some recommendations , " she said . <p> " The sector 's response has been so clear , united and strong that they have been forced to acknowledge us . What they have n't acknowledged is that they could actually take action now . <p> " It certainly does n't need a major research project in two years time . " <p> The Australian Institute of Company Directors , which supported the campaign said the report was a " lost " opportunity . <p> AICD general manager advocacy Louise Petschler said : " A real opportunity to reduce red tape for charities stands to be lost unless ministers take action to provide legislative certainty about the application of the ACL to all fundraising activities . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem as " due to a lack of specific guidance and limited case law in the fundraising context particularly in relation to ' pure ' donations without any supply of goods or services . " <p> FIA CEO Rob Edwards said in a statement : " The report went on to nail the concerns FIA has identified in its submissions to the ACL review , particularly as they may have tax implications . <p> " The sector can face difficulties in translating the provisions from the ' consumer and supplier ' context to the ' donor and fundraiser ' context . <p> " FIA has emphatically argued that donors and consumers are not the same . Donors make a gift and expect nothing in return ; with consumers there is value exchange between buyer and seller and therein lies the problem in trying to treat them the same legally . We are pleased that argument has hit home with the review . " <p> Consumer affairs ministers have until August 2017 to decide their response to the ACL review . 
 <p> The availability and access to suitable financial resources and the need for clear policy leadership around social enterprises entering or operating in the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) were two of the most pressing issues facing Australia 's start-up entrepreneurs , according to a new report . <p> The availability and access to suitable financial resources and the need for clear policy leadership around social enterprises entering or operating in the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) were two of the most pressing issues facing Australia 's start-up entrepreneurs , according to a new report . <p> Report author Dr Chris Mason , a senior research fellow at the Centre for Social Impact at Swinburne University , told Pro Bono News that entrepreneurs that took part in the study in Western Australia had plenty of enthusiasm but sometimes lacked the knowledge that ensured their survival . <p> " Without a doubt they 're quick to learn , eager to take on challenges , and are quite savvy in partnering and growing their business , " Mason said . <p> " But where they 're struggling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance , retaining staff and adapting to market changes such as the NDIS . <p> " Undoubtedly the most pressing issue for many social enterprises was availability and access to suitable financial resources , which directly affects longer term resilience . " <p> Mason said there was a lot of research for small businesses on what makes them resilient and what strategies they put in place to keep them going but there was very little knowledge about what was unique about social enterprises . <p> " We were trying to understand what makes social enterprise tick basically , " he said . <p> " We had an opportunity to walk alongside quite a few social enterprises in WA to understand what it is they do to overcome the many barriers that they face in starting up and growing their social enterprise and their social impact . " <p> The study followed 10 social enterprises over a 12-month period and is the latest in the Bankwest Foundation Social Impact Series . <p> " We found that social enterprises tend to use their relative scale , so many of them are medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategically that makes them a lot more nimble in responding to new opportunities , " Mason said . <p> " For example they are very open to discussing ways that they can work with other organisations and collaborate and form partnerships . We have found that the small to medium social enterprises have certainly become more active in doing that . <p> " They also have a very strong social impact in what they do ... and that 's a bit of an intangible so as markets change such as has occurred with the NDIS , one of the reactions to that for social enterprise is to look around and say that despite these changes we believe very strongly that what we are doing is having a significant social impact for our beneficiaries and that is what is going to keep us going . <p> " It 's kind of like their X factor . " <p> However , the report found that due to the typically small nature of the social enterprises , many entrepreneurs found it challenging to dedicate adequate resources to systems that would enable effective reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn meant that investors had little information upon which to base their decisions , creating a vicious circle surrounding attracting and maintaining funding levels , " Mason said . <p> " If we could overcome this hurdle it would help these businesses communicate better with potential investors , help them secure funding and help give them a competitive edge in applying for grants and tenders . " <p> The report recommended the need for clear policy leadership around social enterprises entering or operating in the NDIS and policy development to secure government support . <p> " Despite the changes that are going on in WA , political and economic and social changes in the last two years , not one social enterprise has gone out of business.They are still going , they are still growing and still finding new ways that they can develop not only themselves as organisations and how they are structured but how to they deliver their services and do it better and be competitive and work smartly with other organisations , " Mason said . <p> " And that 's what we are beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say look we are open to collaboration ... and how do we compliment each other . Look at the role of social enterprise in the NDIS , I think marketisation , which is a common part of schemes like the NDIS it is all about opening up service provision ... I do n't think social enterprise is the answer to NDIS but it is a model that can work . " <p> Mason said that to be successful in the NDIS there was a need for policy leadership . <p> " That comes from a really a clear understanding that if you want social enterprises involved in this space to work alongside not-for-profit or for-profit providers then you have to develop actually for those organisations to sprout up and provide services . It 's about a supportive environment for social enterprise . " <p> Mason said that having identified the need for a streamlined data-collection and reporting system the Centre for Social Impact was now working on producing a web-based tool to be released later this year . <p> " Of all the issues thrown up by the report this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most difference . Attracting and holding on to investors is the key to everything and so if we can ease the path through that minefield then we hope these sustainable enterprises will benefit greatly , " he said . <p> Study participant and social entrepreneur Nick Maisey , founder and director of Befriend , said that he was excited by the immediate practical application of the research . <p> " The development of a web-based tool for social and financial data collection and analysis will be incredibly useful and will enable great efficiency and effectiveness for social entrepreneurs , " Maisey said . <p> " It 's an important step in developing an ecosystem in which social enterprises can flourish . " 
 <h> Australia a Leading Example of Shared Value Business Concept <p> The US-based co-founder of the shared value business concept , Mark Kramer says he is hugely impressed with the progress Australian companies have made since he first explored the model here five years ago . <p> The US-based co-founder of the shared value business concept , Mark Kramer says he is hugely impressed with the progress Australian companies have made since he first explored the model here five years ago . <p> Kramer returned to Melbourne to speak at the Shared Value Forum as part of the Shared Value Project and was full of praise for companies who had progressed the concept in that time . <p> " I really have been impressed each of the years that I have been coming back here , on how the momentum has been building for shared value and the understanding and awareness . <p> " At the very first Shared Value Forum in Australia all of the participants were really talking about philanthropy projects and they did n't really get that shared value was about competitive strategy and business projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business initiative that was truly a shared value initiative . " <p> He said there had been quite a shift in attitude to the benefits of the concept . <p> " We had a session with analysts and some investors from superannuation funds and we have done this for a couple of years in a row and the scepticism that was there in the analyst community two or three years ago I found much less and in fact saw that they really have embraced the idea , " he said . <p> " I think there has been tremendous positive development here in understanding the idea and companies really beginning to think about how to put it into practice . " <p> Kramer said the basic concept of shared value had not changed over the years . <p> " The basic idea that companies can create a competitive advantage by having a positive social path , that that can be a source of innovation and an aspect of strategy , I think still remains from the original idea , " he said . <p> " I think our knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . We are developing teaching cases for Harvard Business School and we taught last year the first course on shared value . <p> " Michael Porter co-founder of shared value concept and I have been doing executive education sessions . This has been the third year we have done it and as we really studied companies in depth with examples of shared value I think we have gotten a much deeper appreciation for how it works , what it takes , what the benefits are . " <p> When asked about stand out examples of shared value in Australia he pointed to the NAB Assist program describing it as " a phenomenal example of shared value " . <p> " Instead of simply levying fees and penalties on people who have fallen behind on their payments they actually work with them to restructure their debt and they get 97 per cent of their people out of debt within 90 days , " he said . <p> " And it is actually driving $70 million a year to the bottom line of NAB that would have been a bad debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank that is doing this and it 's a fantastic example of shared value . " <p> In comparing Australia with other countries engaging with the shared value concept he said Australia was " absolutely up there " . <p> " I think some of the Scandinavian countries and European countries have really embraced this concept but I would certainly put Australia in the top 10 and I suspect it would be in the top five , " he said . <p> Back in 2012 Kramer told the first Melbourne forum that the challenge for companies was to think about what social value meant to them and what they could do to magnify the social value they created . <p> He said there were three ways for business to engage with society -- via traditional corporate philanthropy , continued corporate responsibility and by creating shared value where businesses find opportunities to solve social problems . <p> " Corporates have a unique opportunity to scale up programs that governments and NGOs ca n't do , " he said . <p> " Shared value is the most significant change in thinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Shared value adds ' a third lens ' by thinking about social needs and business opportunities . " <p> In 2011 , the Harvard Business Review published the article , The Big Idea : Creation of Shared Value by Kramer and Porter . <p> " Businesses must reconnect company success with social progress . Shared value is not social responsibility , philanthropy , or even sustainability , but a new way to achieve economic success , " Kramer and Porter said in the Harvard publication . <p> Executive director of the Shared Value Project Helen Steel has previously described shared value as " placing social problems at the core of business objectives " . <p> " The simplicity of the concept , and ability to reference back to Michael Porter and Mark Kramer 's Creating Shared Value , are making it applicable and a powerful way forward in which Australian business can work with society and be a part of the new social agenda , " Steel wrote in a blog for Pro Bono News in 2015 . <p> " The take up and successful adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress the Shared Value Project has seen since its inception as a forum in 2011 , bringing leaders together to discuss ' what is shared value ? ' , to the rapid uptake by companies and our formal establishment in 2014 as the peak practice body for shared value in Australia , and regional partner of the Shared Value Initiative . " 
 <h> Queensland Launches First Social Benefit Bond <p> Social Ventures Australia ( SVA ) has launched Queensland 's first social impact bond , seeking private capital to address social issues around out-of-home care in a spin-off of to the successful NSW Newpin bond . <p> Social Ventures Australia ( SVA ) has launched Queensland 's first social impact bond , seeking private capital to address social issues around out-of-home care in a spin-off of to the successful NSW Newpin bond . <p> SVA hopes to raise $6 million to fund a program to reunite children in out-of-home-care in Queensland with their parent or parents , targeting returns for investors of 7.5 per cent per annum linked to the success of the program . <p> " This builds on the success of the NSW Newpin Social Benefit Bond , which has been generating strong social and financial returns since its inception , " SVA CEO Rob Koczkar said . <p> The bond will be known as the Newpin Queensland Social Benefit Bond ( Newpin Qld SBB ) . <p> " SVA is seeking to raise $6 million to fund the Newpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to reunify children in out-of-home-care in Queensland to their parents . Given the overrepresentation of First Australian children in the out-of-home-care system in Queensland , this will be a focus for the program , " Koczkar said . <p> " Investor returns will be linked to the number of children successfully reunited with their families through the program . The Newpin Qld SBB is targeting returns of 7.5 per cent per annum and expects to close by 30 June 2017 , prior to the commencement of the program in late 2017 . " <p> said the minimum subscription was $50,000 . <p> " Newpin is an 18-month program that is designed to strengthen family engagement . It will be delivered by health and community service provider UnitingCare Queensland in three locations , with the first pilot commencing in Cairns in 2018 , " he said . <p> " The centres will be attended by both the parent and the pre-school aged children at least twice weekly to undertake parenting modules , therapeutic group meetings , and child development activities . Approximately 200 parents , with approximately 560 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five years . " <p> told Pro Bono News he expected the bond issue to be finalised before the end of the financial year . <p> " We have been encouraged by the response we have received in social impact bonds and other impact investing ideas we have taken to investors all across Australia . I would expect there to be interest not just in Queensland but in other parts of Australia in this social impact bond I am very confident we can find a home for the $6 million , " he said . <p> " Since launching the first Australian social impact bond in 2013 , we have seen considerable momentum in this space as demand grows for innovative ways to finance the solutions to challenging social problems . <p> " This is a high impact investment opportunity which aims to generate a competitive financial return while creating a lasting difference in the lives of vulnerable children and their families , " he said . <p> According to SVA , currently more than 9,000 Queensland children are living away from their parents in either foster care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is widely acknowledged that , where it is safe to do so , supporting children within their family is highly advantageous to their health and wellbeing . As well as a heavy social burden , out-of-home-care imposes a significant financial cost . In 2014/15 , the Queensland government spent an average of $50,000 on each child in out-of-home-care , " Koczkar said . <p> Queensland treasurer Curtis Pitt said in a statement : " Working in collaboration with the social service sector , investors and across government , we can together achieve positive social outcomes and to address the most pressing social challenges , the Queensland government is looking at innovative approaches to service delivery . " <p> UnitingCare Queensland CEO Anne Cross said : " We are passionate about supporting people to be the best they can be -- people from all walks of life , who live in many different locations . With statistics showing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children nine times more likely to be in out-of-home-care than a non-Indigenous child , the time for change is now . <p> " The Newpin Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families , particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children living apart from their parents . We will partner with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities , empowering them to lead the development , implementation and delivery of key components of the program . " <p> said SVA had already achieved strong results with the Newpin SBB in NSW which is currently in its fourth year . <p> " The Newpin SBB has successfully restored 130 children to the care of their parent or parents , and delivered a return of 12 per cent per annum to investors over a three-year period to 30 June 2016 , " he said . <p> " Every time we do a bond it 's done in consultation with the government and the service provider and builds on the work that has been done previously and so in NSW the outcome measure is a restoration rate and in Queensland it is the number of children restored to families . <p> " Now Queensland NSW and South Australia which have or have had bonds in the market and in Victoria they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are discussions with the government in WA that this is an area that they are looking to explore . I think most states in Australia are pursuing this with some vigour . " <p> The aim of the SA bond is to use a combination of private sector capital and not-for-profit expertise to support participants with three years of accommodation , case management , pathways to employment and life skills development , with the aim of reducing homelessness while providing returns to investors.In July 2016 the Victorian government announced its first two social impact bonds focusing on reducing disadvantage through drug and alcohol treatment programs , and young people transitioning from out-of-home care . 
 <p> Libby Davies is the CEO of White Ribbon Australia , Australia 's only national , male-led organisation to stop violence against women . She is this week 's Changemaker . <p> Since being first launched in Canada in 1991 , White Ribbon has become the world 's largest male-led movement to end men 's violence against women and is now active in more than 60 countries . <p> The organisation launched in Australia in 2003 , with the mission to make women 's safety a men 's issue too . <p> The campaign works through primary prevention initiatives involving awareness raising and education , and programs with youth , schools , workplaces and across the broader community . <p> For Davies , who says she grew up during the second tranche of feminism , engaging men is crucial to realising gender equality . <p> She says her goal is that one day women around the world , can be truly equal citizens . <p> Prior to joining White Ribbon Australia Davies previously held CEO positions in national organisations such as Family Services Australia , UnitingCare Australia and Brain Injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including at ministerial , national and state levels . <p> She is also a director of Lifeline Australia , member of the NSW Domestic and Family Violence Council , member of the NSW Preventing Domestic and Family Violence Social Investment Advisory Group and Ministerial Roundtable on Prevention of Violence , Victoria . <p> In this week 's Changemaker , which coincides with the beginning of Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month , Davies talks about why White Ribbon 's social change model was " on the money " , the importance of workplaces being part of the change and how where there 's a will , there 's a way . <p> What attracted you to the not-for-profit sector ? <p> Probably the first reason that would come to mind to answer that is the desire to make a difference . Whilst I 've worked very closely with government , in the not-for-profit sector there is a greater degree of flexibility and freedom to be advocates and changemakers , and to influence the community and positions of government , for profits , not for profits or for purpose organisations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ensuring that work is built on evidence-based best practice and best practice that is absolutely independently evaluated . <p> So the work that I have done over the years in social change and driving more effective outcomes in terms of delivering greater wellbeing to our communities in various ways has always been through that commitment to make a difference and to see positive change realised . <p> The other important part of why I work in this area is because we can operate almost , and this sounds very altruistic but , I think it is with a conscience . We are able to provide a strong conscience to the way in which resources are distributed particularly to meet the needs of marginalised and vulnerable Australians . <p> So I have always had a strong commitment to working in this sector for those reasons and I 've been very lucky and fortunate to work in organisations where there is a very strong alignment of my values and the values of the organisation . <p> What does a typical day for you look like as CEO of White Ribbon Australia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in Darwin , last week I was in three capital cities , Darwin , Melbourne and Sydney , this week it will be Sydney , Darwin and Canberra . So keeping up with the pace of being a CEO , because most CEOs work quite long weeks , so a 65 to a 75 or 80 hour week is not uncommon . And I think you need to start your day by making sure you look after yourself . <p> So keeping in shape is always very important for me . I have an early start , I do yoga and I power walk or swim , and I like to meditate as well . So that gets me started for the day . I am usually in the office , when I 'm in the office and not travelling , by 7.30 . I enjoy that time before the rest of the team get in so that I can really plan the most important elements of my day going forward , and spend often early morning with my EA going through my day , my week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Looking at the way our ongoing delivery against our strategy , executing the workload against that . So that means there is a lot of meetings involved particularly with my senior executive team . But I also ensure that I meet with my whole staff on a regular basis , on one on ones as well , to get a sense of how they 're travelling in terms of executing their workload . <p> Communication , you are available 24/7 so that is a big part of what you do . And of course social media and the various platforms mean that you are constantly looking at your phone or your ipad . So communication and availability . <p> Trying to set a rhythm into your day , even when I am travelling and that is very difficult at times because you have so many competing demands on your time . But I do try and lock in . This morning for example , I 've got this interview , I have got a discussion with my EA , I 've got two teleconferences and then I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Darwin for . So executing your meetings and ensuring they are short , concise and productive is really important . <p> The other important part of what a CEO does is ensuring that the human resources in your organisation meet the needs of the organisation . So hiring and putting the right people in place and enabling those people to develop as part of the development of the ongoing culture within the organisation and in accordance with its values and strategic direction is very critical . <p> Of course , surrounding all of that is our financial viability . For an organisation like White Ribbon we are less than 10 per cent government funded so executing our strategies to ensure viability is a key part as well of my oversight role . <p> But I do have one rule and that is when I go to sleep , I do not have my ipad or my iphone next to me . You need to be able to shut down and to shut off otherwise it becomes all consuming , you can wake up at 2am and you are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy so I do try to have a demarcation between when I stop looking at my communications and it is my time . <p> Why is it important to involve men in stopping family violence ? <p> I grew up and went to university , and my undergraduate years were in very much what we call the second tranche of feminism . In the 1970s and 1980s that second tranche was very much breaking down the confines of gender to enable greater gender equality and to ensure that the rights of women to be the best they could be and to have access to opportunities the same as men were actually validated . <p> And one thing that struck me in all of the feminist meetings that I went to , there were no men in the room . And yet we were talking about the fact that the glass ceiling was being imposed by men , that men were making most of the decisions about the distribution of resources in our community , men were the powerbrokers , that sense of privilege and control that was attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realising gender equality . And so , I thought well why are n't we talking to men about this ? Why are these feminist action groups so heavily dominated by females . Yes , there were male feminists but they were n't in great numbers . <p> The thing that attracted me to the White Ribbon social change movement was the inclusion of men in a movement which was about standing beside all of the hard work women had done through the first and second tranche and now the third tranche of feminism that we 're in now , to break down that sense of power and control and privilege that some men have that precludes women from being truly equal citizens or truly equal in their relationships etc . <p> So I think what for me what was really important was that this social change movement harnesses the energy of men to change gender constructs that are mostly perpetrated by men . So it is about asking men to be our allies in driving this change and working with them to develop their understanding and the tools for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of my leadership , I 've got a strong commitment to pursuing what is fair and what is right , and I felt that this social change model White Ribbon was developing was absolutely on the money in terms of enabling men to stand up and be part of the change movement to really realise gender equality , and a key part of that was preventing men 's violence against women , which is one of the drivers of gender inequality . <p> What are White Ribbon Australia current priorities ? <p> Our priorities are very much the continuing engagement of men in the prevention of violence against women . In changing the view of masculinity . In creating a masculinity that enables men to walk and stand beside women in truly equal ways . To provide the tools of change to the community . <p> The majority of human beings spend the majority of their life in the workplace and workplaces therefore are significant as a cultural environment that normalise our ways of behaving , our attitudes and the constructs that we have that guide social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So workplaces are a key tool in unlocking the drivers of inequality and creating a much more egalitarian society . I think what is key for us in developing the workplace accreditation program was the use of that workplace as an optimum place of change . And the workplace accreditation program developed in 2012 has now realised over 100 organisation as White Ribbon accredited , there are another 123 going under accreditation at the moment , and that number is continually increasing and there are over 800 plus organisations on our expressions of interest and waiting list . So workplaces are embracing this and realising that they need to be part of the change . <p> Our respectful relationships has been around in education for at least 30 years but it continually gets refocused , and the latest refocus of respectful relationships education is on the issue of deconstructing and reconstructing masculinities to ensure that we are not creating young people who perpetuate inequality or who perpetuate violence against women . <p> The other of course which I mentioned to start with is the engagement of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trained men who are the front face of White Ribbon social change movement , and they are supported by advocates and by our supporters , and that 's the community at work . So we are a community-owned and community-driven model of social change , very much accountable to the feminist movement , accountable meaning that we respect and understand and work alongside the many women who have been driving change in this space . <p> May marks Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month . Why is it important to have an event like this to raise community awareness ? <p> For hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years , the whole issue of violence against women , or domestic and family violence was something that was a private matter between two people or a family , or the inner family , kept behind closed doors , and the silence was never broken around the impact that was had on maintaining control over women and their children . <p> What has happened now is we have seen , fortunately , a breaking of that silence , women speaking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrated against them , not just physical violence , but financial , psychological , emotional violence . And how if they are going to be treated and recognised and realised as truly equal members of our community that they should n't have to put up with that violence . <p> And events , awareness raising months , international days , all focus attention on what is one of the most critical issues to be dealt with if we are going to realise gender equality . <p> We say : " White Ribbon every day , all year " . Because the engagement of men to prevent violence against women , the breaking down of the barriers to understanding what causes violence against women , women feeling comfortable to report violence and to know that there are very supportive pathways for them to leave violent relationships and to be supported . And similarly men who perpetuate violence , for perpetrators to be supported to change their behaviours . All of these things are realising an increase in reporting which means we are getting an increase in figures of levels of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking out . Then we hope of course , is that what we will see as our prevention and support work will continue to be enhanced then those figures will eventually drop . So we are talking about intergenerational , social impact change . <p> Through your work what is your ultimate goal ? <p> My goal is that women in Australia , and around the world , can live in an environment where they do have the opportunity to be truly equal citizens . That we do have a community of true gender equality . Where men and women are respected equally , and make equal contributions to the health and wellbeing of the community . And I think I would like to see that the feminist frameworks and movement that have initiated gender equality as being key to the health and well being of a community is something that will benefit my granddaughter , and my grandson . So that as they grow up the inhibitors of gender equality and a truly health community are minimised through very solid action that drives positive social change , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in their realising their potential and live much healthier lives . <p> What are you reading or watching at the moment ? <p> I have actually just finished an amazing historical account of Charles Bean , the official Australian world war one historian and war correspondent , who wrote the official history of World War One , and of course was very instrumental in the establishment of the Australian War Memorial . It was written by a journalist called Ross Coulthart and it is interesting that I actually finished the book on Anzac Day . <p> It is an amazing hardcopy book , not a Kindle . I enjoyed reading both the reference to the primary material that was sourced and other material that was sourced to support the development of the book , and to really understand the relationship between Australia and the British government in those early years . How that manifested in the political and social and economic climate that surrounded our participation in World War One and the huge human toll that resulted from those political engagements . I do n't think till you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you walk through the war memorial , you see the figures , you see the wall of remembrance and you know how many hundreds of thousands of Australian young men that were sacrificed really in that war effort , but the more you read the primary material , it sort of hits home , the magnitude of the cost that we paid . <p> So history is a very important part of understanding our social context so I do love to read historical accounts . I love to read a good novel as well . <p> When I travel I have both material that I read from a business point of view , such as the Harvard Business Review , and I do take time , to read my novel . I do sort of cut off and try not to spend every minute doing 50,000 emails . You 're a little bit more refreshed if you do that , rather than flogging yourself all the time with work . <p> Do you have a favourite saying ? <p> " Where there 's a will there 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work ethic . When you believe passionately in something you must ensure that you work through that to realise its potential . <p> I love the line that we use as part of our mission for White Ribbon which is : " Engaging men to make women safety a men 's issue too . " 
 <h> Work for the Dole Denounced as ' Demonstrable Failure ' as Govt Announces Crackdown <p> The social sector has reiterated calls to abolish the Work for the Dole program describing it as a " demonstrable failure " amid claims the government is set to crackdown on people who claim welfare payments while refusing to participate in the scheme . <p> Work for the Dole Denounced as ' Demonstrable Failure ' as Govt Announces , 1st May 2017 at 8:32 am <p> The social sector has reiterated calls to abolish the Work for the Dole program describing it as a " demonstrable failure " amid claims the government is set to crackdown on people who claim welfare payments while refusing to participate in the scheme . <p> According to reports the upcoming budget on 9 May aims to close a " loophole " that allows payments to continue despite people refusing interviews or placements . <p> Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said there was a " cohort of people " in Australia that actively said no to suitable work . <p> " I think all taxpayers would rightly expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be there as a genuine safety net , not as something that people can choose to fund their lifestyle , " Cash said . <p> However the Australian Council of Social Service has described Work for the Dole as " punitive in its approach " and called for it to be replaced . <p> " We 've been consistently opposed to the scheme because we see it as punitive , and as a program that effectively demonises the unemployed and does n't really do anything to build their skills or improve their job prospects , " Dobson said . <p> " It 's taken money away from other approaches and programs that would be much more effective in supporting people into employment , such as vocational education and training . And critically I think it is really job creation where we need to have action from the government . <p> " A lot of these approaches are premised on the assumption that there is a problem with individuals , that unemployment is because of some failing of the individual whereas we know the actual labour market is very tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four jobseekers and about 10 if you take into account underemployment as well . <p> " So we are really concerned and disappointed that the government do n't look as if they 're abolishing the scheme . " <p> Dobson said talks of closing a " loophole " were a " real concern " . <p> " I assume what she is referring to is the fact that , if job seekers do n't meet their compliance activities , and that can include Work for the Dole ... they can lose their unemployment benefit ... for up to eight weeks , " she said . <p> " Currently the system is actually quite punitive and has quite severe penalties but there are instances where that penalty can be waived . <p> " So if for example that person might have potentially been i 'll , they may not have turned up to an appointment because there was a legitimate reason why they were n't able to do so , then the penalty can be waived . With some job providers also , if someone misses one appointment they do n't apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some discretion for the job provider . <p> " We believe that the current system is already quite severe and the suggestion that the government is tightening it even further is a real concern for us . " <p> Dobson said St Vincent de Paul Society was particularly concerned the current system was leading to the growth of " the working poor " . <p> " One of the real concerns that we see is that growth in underemployment and people who are caught in temporary short-term casual forms of employment and are permanently in that kind of cycle , " she said . <p> " Michaelia Cash mentioned that the crackdown was also on people who were refusing to take up job opportunities with the implication being that they were using it to ' fund their lifestyles ' . <p> " Firstly if you are living on Newstart allowance you are not probably having a very extravagant lifestyle and we overwhelmingly find that people who are unemployed and able to work are desperate to find employment . So they are not choosing to remain in that situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people are compelled and coerced into accepting any job opportunity , irrespective of whether it is appropriate or whether it is temporary or not , is compounding that issue of precarious and insecure employment and the growth in that kind of employment . <p> " I think one of the trends that we 're seeing is a cohort of people who are locked in a vicious cycle where they are in temporary , often inappropriate , forms of employment and then they go back into being unemployed . <p> " For our services we are seeing a lot more people who might be in some form of casual or part time employment but they do n't have enough money to live on and often they are finding themselves falling back into unemployment as I mentioned and so that is another aspect to our concerns around what the government is proposing to do . " <p> Goldie said people needed support that worked . <p> " Over 70 per cent of people who are receiving Newstart have been out of paid work for over a year . This growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a program that has already been shown to be a failure , " she said . <p> " Work for the Dole should be replaced with education and training , paid work experience and supports that are tailored to help a person find real employment . <p> " The funding should be applied to a careers transitions program to include careers counselling for people who really need it .

 <h> NDIS Transport Funding is an Unfortunate Lottery <p> The lack of consistency in how participants are treated around the country in their use of taxi subsidy schemes makes a mockery of the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) as a universal program , writes Spinal Cord Injuries Australia policy and advocacy officer Tony Jones . <p> NDIS Transport Funding is an Unfortunate , 2nd May 2017 at 8:36 am <p> The lack of consistency in how participants are treated around the country in their use of taxi subsidy schemes makes a mockery of the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) as a universal program , writes Spinal Cord Injuries Australia policy and advocacy officer Tony Jones . <p> We know from recent media reports that the NDIA has appealed a decision by the federal court on transport funding for Geelong man Liam McGarrigle . They are asking the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to reconsider the amount paid -- 75 per cent of transport costs totalling $15,850 per year on taxis transporting him to and from his work and activities . As well they might be worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year funding at full scheme . <p> But transport funding under the NDIS has become , for new entrants , an unfortunate lottery for many people who have recently transitioned in . Here 's why : <p> According to the NDIS fact sheet , there are generally three levels of transport funding that you would be entitled to as a participant . Levels two and three equates to the two payment levels of the Mobility Allowance Centrelink supplementary payment for those unable to use regular public transport without difficulty . Beyond that there are " exceptional circumstances " in which you may be entitled to more but there is little information about how that would be assessed , say if you work full-time or have other formal obligations as set out in a participant plan . <p> Experience to date has shown that the three levels paid to participants have been inconsistently applied and often do not cover what a participant actually needs . Yes , there is now flexibility in the core support funding that can be utilised for transport costs but that means you are reducing funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can potentially leave you very vulnerable to a shortfall in this area : do I pay for help for a shower this morning or a taxi to get me to work ? <p> Many participants rely on wheelchair accessible taxis ( WATs ) as their only form of transport . They can not use other modes of transport and depending on where they live other forms of accessible public transport , such as buses and trains , may not exist . Their demands on WATs will be varied and not necessarily easily definable into work , study or volunteering which is the current eligibility criteria for the Mobility Allowance payment . <p> Those same users rely significantly on state and territory government funded taxi subsidy programs that in most cases cover around 50 per cent of the cost of a taxi fare ( with a maximum limit of $60 ) . <p> And here is the elephant in the room regarding transport funding and the NDIS : South Australia , Victoria , Tasmania and Queensland have either removed or are in the process of removing , eligibility to those schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the cost of taxis for those participants . <p> With this lack of consistency in how participants are treated around the country in their use of taxi subsidy schemes , it makes a mockery of the NDIS as a universal program . This inequity will need to be addressed in how transport funding is applied to participants who are disadvantaged by this change . In all cases , the reasons given by state governments for removal of access to taxi subsidy schemes for NDIS participants is that they will receive transport funding in their plan . It makes no accounting for the needs of those participants who travel out socially or for other reasons not covered in the participant plan that will attract no transport funding . They are most certainly disadvantaged because of this . <p> To be clear , the state governments removing eligibility to these scheme for NDIS participants are shifting costs onto the NDIS . <p> There appears not to be any consistency or communication between the various state government agencies , the NDIA and the coordinating bodies ( Department of Social Services in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full roll out . This is clearly an issue that will need to be taken up at a national governance level with the Disability Reform Council . As it currently stands , there is no equity for participants that lose eligibility to taxi subsidies without a corresponding increase in their transport funding through the scheme . Transport agencies have a responsibility to provide adequate accessible services as part of their universal service obligation , irrespective of scheme eligibility , and not shift costs onto the NDIS . <p> Lastly , it is worth noting that these taxi schemes also offer bonuses to taxi drivers to improve response times for picking up subsidy scheme participants , called lifting fees or driver incentive bonuses , that give drivers around $15 additional per fare . Obviously if you are no longer eligible the driver does not get this bonus -- government departments have not thought through this aspect of service that was designed to improve services to people with disabilities . <p> We know from experience that this will also have a negative effect on those being denied access to a taxi subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus . 
 <h> Directors Confident Ahead of Budget <p> Australia 's board directors are more confident than they have been in six years , according to a survey by the Australian Institute of Company Directors ( AICD ) across both the business and not-for-profit sectors . <p> Australia 's board directors are more confident than they have been in six years , according to a survey by the Australian Institute of Company Directors ( AICD ) across both the business and not-for-profit sectors . <p> The bi-annual Director Sentiment Index found that those sitting around Australia 's boardroom tables were feeling " particularly bullish about domestic conditions , with sentiment on investment levels and staff hiring at their highest point since 2011 " . <p> The index measured the opinions and future intentions of directors on a range of issues including the economy , government policy and governance regulations . <p> More than 30 per cent of those who completed the survey listed their primary directorship as being in the not-for-profit sector . <p> AICD chairman Elizabeth Proust said that the increase in business sentiment was primarily driven by increasing confidence around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in the outlook for the Australian economy rose significantly , as did their expectations around the health of the US and Asian economies . Concerns around global economic uncertainty and a China slowdown also dropped substantially , " Proust said . <p> " These results show that directors feel buoyed by the economic outlook and are taking a positive growth mindset . <p> " However , directors remain concerned about the ability of the government and Parliament to drive reform and growth , with 86 per cent rating the current quality of public policy debate in Australia as poor . Directors also ranked less focus on short-termism as the number one measure to boost productivity . " <p> The AICD last month released a Blueprint for Growth national reform policy which recommended a range of structural reforms to improve public policy debate and encourage long-term thinking including the introduction of fixed , four year terms for the federal government . <p> Proust said directors rated taxation reform as the most important short-term issue for the federal government to address , followed by energy policy and infrastructure . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address in the long-term , closely followed by climate change , tax reform , an ageing population and energy policy , " Proust said . <p> The report said : " Given current concerns around housing affordability , directors nominated tighter controls on foreign purchases , a boost to housing supply through streamlined approvals and changes to negative gearing arrangements as the top three measures governments should prioritise to address the issue . <p> " Directors are concerned with matters of legal and regulatory compliance with it appearing as the third most likely issue to keep them awake at night . Half of directors also feel that the current governance regulations under the Corporations Act are too onerous . " <p> The AICD NFP leader Phil Butler told Pro Bono News it was " fantastic " that a third of respondents were from the not-for-profit sector " because it really reflects the interest of our members " . <p> " I think we can pretty well draw the line there that as well as the private sector being more confident with much more of a positive vibe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well there is some increasing confidence from the NFP directors , " Butler said . <p> " Overall there is a better vibe around the place in terms of the economy are the moment . " <p> However Butler said there were still concerns around regulatory reform and parliamentary challenges . <p> " There are challenges with the Senate of getting the reform done that is required . I think the campaign is an example of challenges that continue to face the sector and really create huge inefficiencies for the sector and we need to see change happening there . And directors feel frustrated that we ca n't seem to get that push through , " he said . <p> " Longer term funding agreements is another one that sits at the heart of the sector and enables the sector to be able to plan appropriately and to achieve those longer term outcomes . <p> " I suspect there is a cyclical nature to the findings here . We have seen the worst of the post-global financial crisis . We have seen the move on from the concerns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are starting to be a little bit into the rear vision mirror now and I think generally there is a bit more of a sense of optimism in the broader community . <p> " On a personal perspective ... the fact that governments are perhaps not talking about the slashing and burning of funds to not-for-profit sector is probably a bit of a positive . The worst of those times seem to be over . Of course we have to wait to see what the May budget does from a federal perspective , but there are some positives around that . " <p> Butler said there were some survey surprises in board responses to long-term issues . <p> " One big surprise for me was ... climate change going from eight to two in importance ... that is an interesting one from a director 's perspective ... it 's obviously an issue that is on the radar , " he said . <p> " The other one is the aging population . It is still number four on the list of long-term issues that directors are thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging population and who is going to support the aging population -- they are issues that so many not-for-profit organisations are grappling with now and will be grappling with even more into the future .

 <h> Business Supports Mandatory Sustainability Reporting -- CSR Survey <p> More than half of the respondents to an annual study of corporate social responsibility practices say sustainability reporting should be mandatory -- and for the first time Australian banks have fallen off the list of top 10 CSR companies . <p> More than half of the respondents to an annual study of corporate social responsibility practices say sustainability reporting should be mandatory -- and for the first time Australian banks have fallen off the list of top 10 CSR companies . <p> The ninth annual review of the State of CSR in Australia and New Zealand found that 53 per cent of Australian respondents supported mandatory sustainability reporting for all organisations of a certain size . <p> In New Zealand , support stood at 48 per cent , but only for large companies . Only 7 per cent in both countries said it should not be mandatory . <p> " The issue around sustainability reporting is one of the big messages to come out of this year . We look periodically at the state of sustainability reporting and what value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the question of people 's views on mandatory sustainability reporting for quite some time , " Black said . <p> " I was surprised by the high level of support for mandatory reporting especially when you compare it to where we were a decade ago when a couple of federal government inquiries canvassed that question and there was a resounding lack of support for mandatory sustainability reporting from business in particular . But we now see the tide has shifted significantly on that . <p> " I think that has been an incremental change . First of all there has been significant growth in voluntary sustainability reporting particularly in the use of the Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ) framework . More and more organisations are producing GRI reports and then GRI has evolved and become easier to use and there has been a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of sustainability reporting and I think organisations are seeing significant benefits from it . <p> " Companies are not so fearful anymore of an additional burden for compliance requirements and they are seeing the value in sustainability reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality sustainability report . <p> " I also think we have seen a proliferation of a number of specialised sustainability reporting . For example Rio Tinto put out its tax report and we have seen dedicated human rights reports and that type of thing coming out from different companies , and companies are doing that because they see value in that . <p> " Our results are consistent with global trends , where over 50 countries have introduced some form of regulatory sustainability reporting instrument . The New Zealand Stock Exchange is the latest to consider sustainability reporting disclosure with its review of the NZX Corporate Governance Best Practice Code . " <p> The review also named the CSR top 10 companies in Australia and the top three in New Zealand -- being the companies with the strongest management capabilities for CSR , as rated by their employees . <p> Black said there were some noticeable and surprising changes to the top 10 list for 2017 . <p> " There are some changes in so far as there are some new companies entering . One surprise is that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " This is concerning and makes me wonder where CSR is with the banks . They were an industry sector leader in CSR in Australia and a really early mover . Some of the banks particularly Westpac and NAB have a 15 year track record of excellence in CSR . <p> " This is speculation ... but I think the federal government inquiry into the treatment of consumers is sucking up a lot of bandwidth from the banks and that inquiry does highlight the progress that still needs to be made by the banks in their responsible business practices . " <p> She said one of the pleasant surprises was the IT industry had increased in its level of CSR management practices and capabilities . <p> " We are seeing that the issue of cyber security and the implications of increasing use of technology are extremely high on the list of priorities and I think this is good because all businesses are talking about the internet and how analytics are going to be driving business in the future and this of course brings a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Our data suggests that at least those IT companies that participated in our review are aware of that and businesses are beginning to deal with those issues so I would predict that over the next five years we are going to see a lot more attention to the CSR implications of big data , privacy security , cyber security and so on and we will see technology firms really stepping up their commitments in this space . <p> " The thing about the capabilities measure that underpins the CSR top 10 is the embeddedness of capabilities for managing CSR . These capabilities predicts performance and so we often see names in CSR top 10 that are not necessarily well know yet for CSR or recognised leaders in performance . <p> " These may be leaders now but if they are not leaders now they certainly will be in the future because of the strength of their CSR capabilities .

 <p> The nation 's peak body for disability service providers is calling for urgent action to save the struggling National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) . <p> It has been less than one year since the long-awaited NDIS began its national roll out but already it 's showing signs of struggling , according to National Disability Services ( NDS ) , the peak body for service providers . <p> A report by the NDS , released Thursday , warned people were being rushed into the NDIS to the detriment of providing quality service . <p> The report said : " The scale and complexity of implementation is placing enormous pressure on all stakeholders . Some of this pressure is an inevitable consequence of large-scale change , but some is avoidable . The road to the NDIS is rougher and riskier than it needs to be . " <p> " In the agreements between governments there are very ambitious plans for the number of plans that are going to be processed in a given period . The problem is that a quantitative target is driving everything else . Ultimately we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive compromised by the volume which has to be processed , " Baker said . <p> " Having said that people have been waiting a long time for this scheme so no-one should have to slow it down unnecessarily but we do need quality plans and we need to provide people with a proper planning process -- which at present I do n't think they are getting . There are some good plans but there are some quite poor ones . <p> " The NDIS can not deliver on its great promise to people with disability and their families unless there is a strong and sustainable disability services sector . That sector is at risk . " <p> Since its nation-wide launch in July 2016 , service providers say they have been swamped with demand with NDIS participant numbers doubling in the first six months to December 31 . <p> The NDS report makes 24 recommendations , including for disability service organisations to be involved in the planning process . <p> " Providers of specialist supports have deep knowledge of disability -- and they know their clients , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of participation plans were of " particular concern " and called on the government to address this matter urgently . <p> " There is absolutely no doubt that the planning process needs fixing and I hope that this intervention focuses the government 's and the NDIA 's attention on the need for action , " Siewert said . <p> " Alongside evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on NDIS and feedback given from people with disability , their family and carers , the government needs to consider this report in how to best address problems and gaps in the National Disability Insurance Scheme . <p> " It would be a monumental shame to see this huge transition leaving people worse off when it was intended to do the exact opposite . " <p> A spokesperson for the NDIA , the federal government agency overseeing the scheme 's rollout , told the ABC they would be meeting with the NDS to discuss the report and review the recommendations . <p> " We are currently reviewing provider and participant interaction with the NDIS with a view of improving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The agency is committed to working with people with disability and providers to build and deliver this important reform .
