Major camshaft manufacturers recommend setting valves cold , to avoid erroneous adjustments on lifters that may be " pumped up " If you are setting valves on a fresh engine that has not been run , everything should be well lubricated before you begin . <p> 2 . Remove both valve covers and remove the spark plugs to make the engine easier to turn over . Also , If you are setting valves on all cylinders , it is generally easier and less confusing to just loosen all of the rocker arm adjustment nuts before you begin . This also allows for all of the internal lifter plungers to return to their " home " position . <p> 3 . Using a long handled ratchet or breaker bar attached to the crank bolt , turn the engine over in the clockwise direction . <p> A. Starting with #1 cylinder , turn the engine over until the exhaust pushrod just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop and adjust the intake valve on the same cylinder . <p> 1 ) Tighten the rocker until you can roll the pushrod between your thumb and forefinger with the slightest bit of resistance . <p> 2 ) At this point tighten between an additional quarter to half of a turn . <p> C. You have now adjusted the #1 intake valve . You will now want to turn the engine over while watching the same intake pushrod that you just set , it will go full open and then begin to close . When it is almost closed , stop and adjust the exhaust rocker arm on that particular cylinder . By following this procedure , you are assured that both of the lifters are at the base circle of the cam and that there is no additional pre-load applied to them from cam lift at this point . <p> D. You are now able to repeat this procedure on the remaining cylinders.

@@48406188 @1906188/ <h> Recommended Crate Engine Start-Up Procedure <p> 1 . SAFETY FIRST ! If the car is on the ground , be sure the emergency brake is set , the wheels are chocked , and the transmission can not fall into gear . <p> 2 . Be sure to check the oil level in the engine and prime the oil system with an engine priming tool ! This is the most important step ! Your crate engine has most likely sat for a while and most of it 's lubrication has drained back to the pan ! <p> 3 . Quality 10W-30 or 10W-40 Oil is recommended for GM 's Performance Crate Engines . Most Stock Factory replacement engines use either 5W-30 or 10W-30 oil . If you plan on running synthetic oils , we recommend that a new engine is first broken in with regular mineral type engine oil . <p> 4 . Adjust the distributor timing roughly by hand for quick start up and smoothest idle possible . <p> 5 . Set the ignition timing after engine starts. - Starting point for most carbureted crate engines is 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer controlled engines with a distributor are generally set at 0 degrees before top dead center with the set timing connector disconnected ( refer to your vehicles service manual for details ) <p> 6 . Flat tappet hydraulic cams only- ( Such as the 250 hp-350 , 290hp-350 &amp; 330hp-350 Run the engine between 2,000 and 2,500 RPM 's , with no-load on the engine for the first 30 minutes . This is critical to break in the camshaft . <p> 7 . Roller Cammed engines ( such as the ZZ4 , F.B. 385 , 383 's and big blocks ) do not need to follow the procedure in step 6 because roller cams do not need to be broken in . <p> 8 . Remember that the cooling system on a fresh engine swap will have a lot of trapped air , which will lead to wild temperature gauge readings and possible water pump cavitation ( water pump not moving coolant due to trapped air ) To help avoid trapped air in the cooling system , try to fill the cooling system up with a 50/50 mix of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting the engine . Leave the radiator cap off during this time . This will tend to help purge a fair amount of trapped air before you start the engine . Specialty fill funnels can also be purchased from Listle tools and Snap-On dealers that help alleviate this problem . Also helpful during break-in is to use a Lever-Vent type radiator cap on your radiator in so that you can manually purge trapped air while engine is running- ( use extreme caution to avoid being burned by hot coolant ) Your normal cap can then be re-installed after engine cools off . <p> 9 . Drive the vehicle with varying speeds and loads on the engine for the first 30 miles . Be sure not to use a lot of throttle or high RPM . <p> The following 2 steps generally are not necessary due to our advanced piston ring sealing technology , but can be performed to help ring break in . <p> 10 . Run five or six medium-throttle accelerations to about 3000 RPM ( 40 to 50 MPH ) , then letting off in gear and coasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple hard throttle accelerations up to about 5000 RPM ( 55 to 60 MPH ) , then letting off in gear and coasting back down to 20 MPH . <p> 12 . Let engine cool and change the oil and filter and check coolant level , top off if necessary . <p> 13 . Drive the next 500 miles normally , without high RPM 's ( below 5000 RPM ) , hard use , or extended periods of high loading . 14 . Change the oil and oil filter again. - Keep an eye on oil level during the first thousand or so miles . 15 .

Flexible fuel vehicles can be operated with a blend of ethanol and gasoline , up to 85 percent ethanol . In order to adjust the ignition timing and the fuel quantity to be injected , the engine management system requires information about the percentage of ethanol in the fuel . <p> The flex fuel sensor uses quick-connect style fuel connections , an incoming fuel connection , and an outgoing fuel connection . All fuel passes through the flex fuel sensor before continuing on to the fuel rail . The flex fuel sensor measures the fuel alcohol content , and sends an electrical signal to the engine control module ( ECM ) to indicate ethanol percentage . <p> The flex fuel sensor has a three-wire electrical harness connector . The three wires provide a ground circuit , a power source , and a signal output to the ECM . The power source is battery positive voltage and the ground circuit connects to an engine ground . The signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alcohol content information is supplied to the ECM from the fuel composition sensor . The fuel composition sensor has a battery positive circuit , a signal circuit , and a ground circuit . The fuel composition sensor uses a microprocessor inside the sensor to measure the ethanol percentage and changes the output signal accordingly . The signal circuit carries the ethanol percentage via the frequency signal . The ECM provides an internal pull up to 5V on the signal circuit , and the fuel composition sensor pulls the 5V to ground in pulses . The normal range of operating frequency is between 50 " 150Hz . The microprocessor inside the sensor is capable of a certain amount of self-diagnosis . An output frequency between 180Hz and 190Hz indicates that the fuel is contaminated .

When the idea of an all new big-block fuel injection system first came up , we all thought it was a good one . When it was proposed that it be integrated with our 502 crate engine , we thought somebody clearly lost their mind . Who could possibly need the awesome , flat , broad torque curve only available with a long runner dry manifold ? And who would want the neck-snapping throttle response of MEFI 4 controlled port fuel injectors ? And what would be the need for aggressive tunnel ram styling ?

But the real story is the torque curve , the Ram Jet 502 makes more torque throughout its operating range . <p> This is possible because Ram Jet has a larger plenum and runners than would ever be possible in a carbureted application . This means greater intake efficiency and greater torque without sacrificing driveability . The Ram Jet manifold is so efficient that we 're able to make all of this horsepower and torque with a production L98 throttle body assembly , you know , the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more power in their 350ci engines . It 's all about airflow quality , velocity , and fuel and spark management . You 'll just have to drive one to appreciate it . <p> The Ram Jet 502 is not intended for marine use , and should only be used in 1973 and earlier pre-emissions street vehicles or any year off road vehicles . Technical Notes : Do not use bolt sealer on the cylinder head bolts , the holes are blind tapped . <p> The New MEFI 4 Controller incorporates a " green engine rev limiter " This rev limiter is set so that maximum engine rpm for the first hours of run time does not exceed 4000 rpm .
