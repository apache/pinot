And two , if you are n't  familiar with the proper lingo , things can get hairy pretty quickly . To make things easier , especially if you are new to learning about Thai visas , we 've addressed some common misconceptions and lingo mistakes . <p> Let 's start with the basics . There are many different types of Thai visas . They include business , dependent , education , retirement , tourist , medical , and volunteer visas . You can recognize a Thai visa by the shiny paper sticker placed in your passport . They give you varying lengths of stays , can be extended , and have different application requirements for each type . <h> Common Misconceptions Explained <p> Weve seen our fair share of discussions gone wrong in online forums and on Facebook threads . Here are two questions that commonly pop up but have a multitude of answers : <h> Can I- apply for- a Thai visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The closest you can get to applying for a visa in Thailand is a Visa On Arrival literally meters before going- through the immigration checkpoint to get into Thailand . And this only applies to passport holders of these 21 countries . Immigration counters at most land crossings- along Thailands border ( not all entry points ) as well as at- Thailands international airports issue this type of visa . But again , its just before you actually enter ther country . <p> A Thai visa should also not be confused with the free Visa Exempt Stamp , which is n't a visa . We talk more about this below . <p> Otherwise , foreigners looking to enter Thailand on a Tourist or Non Immigrant visa must apply for one at either- a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate-General . These offices only exist in- other countries around the world and not in Thailand . <p> Living in America and need a Thai visa ? There 's a Royal Thai Embassy in Washington , DC . Vacationing in Canada ? Its in Ottawa . Sating in Australia ? Go to Canberra . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the UK . There are also smaller Royal Thai Consulate-Generals in- each of these countries . <p> Alternatively , you can not apply for a Thai visa at your countrys embassy in Thailand . For example , an American can not go to the American Embassy in Thailand ( located in Bangkok ) and apply for a Thai visa . It is not possible . <p> It is possible to change your visa type once you are in Thailand , but you must already have an existing visa . This can be done at the Office of Immigration Bureau- in Bangkok . Its located on Soi Suan Plu off South Sathorn Road and can be reached at ( 022 ) 873-101 . <h> A single entry tourist Thai visa is good for 60 days . Or is it 90 days ? <p> A single entry tourist visa grants a visitor up to 60 days in Thailand . However , you can apply for a 30-day extension at your local immigration office ( there is one in every- province , i.e. Thai " state " ) , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An extension costs 1,900 baht and the 30 days will be tacked on after the 60th day of your Thai tourist visa , no matter when you apply for it . <p> Therefore , a single entry tourist visa can get you 60 days plus a 30-day extension for a total of 90 days . <h> Lingo Mistakes <p> Using improper terminology causes a lot of confusion about an already confusing subject ! Let 's clarify a few things : <h> A visa exempt stamp is not a visa . <p> Let 's start with the definition of exempt , as defined by Merrian-Websters Dictionary : <p> exempt ( adj ) : not required to do something that others are required to do <p> A visa exempt stamp means that you are not required to have a visa . Its a waiver . In lieu of a visa , a visa exempt stamp ( the rubber kind with ink ) is stamped into your passport . <p> Citizens of the following 55 countries , including Australia , Canada , Germany , Japan , New Zealand , South Africa , the UK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to stay in Thailand for 30 days for free . <p> A visa exempt stamp is perfect for the short-term traveler . Anyone who wants to stay in Thailand for less than a month or is passing through as they hop around Southeast Asia should stick with the convenient ( and did we mention , free ? ) visa exempt stamp . <p> If you do want to stay a bit longer , you can apply for an extension at any local Thai Immigration Office . As of August 29 , 2014 , an extension will grant you another 30 days and costs 1,900 baht . <p> Remember , it is not a visa . It is simply an ink stamp in your passport . <h> There is no such thing as a work visa . <p> There is a Non Immigrant B Business Visa , nicknamed a B Visa , and there is a Work Permit . They are two separate , very different documents . They can not be combined and dubbed " work visa . " <p> A Non Immigrant Business Visa is the shiny paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to legally work in Thailand . Its good for up to a year ( once its been extended during the first 90 days ) and is issued by a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate . A Business Visa costs roughly the equivalent of 65 USD ; the exact fee and method of payment vary slightly for each countrys office due to the currency exchange rate . <p> A Work Permit is a document that looks a lot like a blue passport and is issued by Thailands Department of Labor . Your employer provides you with the right paperwork to apply for a Thai work permit . A work permit shows that you are a properly registered tax-paying employee and it costs 3,000 baht ( roughly 100 USD ) for one year . <p> To work legally in Thailand , you need both a B Visa and a Work Permit . But again , there is no such thing as a work visa . <p> A border run and visa run are two different things . <p> A border run is , quite literally , a run to the ( Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa entry on your multiple entry visa OR to re-enter Thailand on a Visa Exempt Stamp or a Visa On Arrival ( if you are not on a multiple entry visa ) . <p> The most common border run method is to take a scheduled van to the land border of Thailands neighboring countries ( Myanmar , Laos , Cambodia , or Malaysia ) . Foreigners cross the border for short time and then re-enter Thailand . <p> A visa run is much more complex than a border run . It involves going to a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate ( which only exist outside of Thailand ) and applying for a visa . <p> A visa run is not a quick , relatively easy , or inexpensive trip like a border run is . Instead , it usually involves standing in a long line to apply for a new visa ( hoping that all your paperwork is correct and that you 're approved ) ; spending at least one night in the neighboring country ; waiting in line to pick up your new visa after its been processed ; re-entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residency visa . <p> There is what 's called Thai permanent residency , but it is not a visa because you no longer have to apply for extension of stay and are not required to leave the country every year for a new one . The eligibility requirements to get Thai permanent residency are pretty steep and few foreigners are granted it each year . Obtaining Thai citizenship can be even harder . <p> There is such a thing as a residence certificate . It is a simple document that proves you are residing here ( i.e , that you are paying rent ) . For example , a residence certificate is required when applying for a Thai license or buying a vehicle in Thailand . But it is NOT a visa or part of the paperwork required to get a visa . <p> Foreigners who want to live in Thailand for many years are best off obtaining a Non Immigrant Visa and reapplying for a new one or extending it every year . Just make sure you still meet the minimum visa and extension requirements ! It is a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Non Immigrant Business , Education , Dependent , or Retirement Visas . <h> Covering the Thai Visa Basics <p> We hope this sets straight some of the basic questions people often have with Thai visas . Before you get the correct answer , you have to be able to ask the correct question . Good luck ! <p> The immigration office is telling me I need something from my consulate that says I am married to my husband , besides my marriage certificate . Is this a form or just a written paragraph that is notarized ? <p> Its a template form ( at least , it was for us at the US Consulate ) that the Consulate/Embassy can provide . We wrote a sentence or two stating that " I , ( NAME ) lawfully wed ( NAME ) on DAY MONTH YEAR in STATE , COUNTRY . " We were required to write the sentence and sign the form in front of a consulate official . Then they notarize it . It cost us 50 USD . <p> I 'm curious as to how you manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renew your long term Non Imm visas . I 'm on a spousal visa ( lots of hassle ) but the best visa I ever obtained was a one year multiple entry visa . Its downside was that I had to do a run every sixty days . But I did n't  mind that . The trouble is they do n't  give those visas easily and I was turned down initially . Only when I showed them my marriage papers was one granted . As you are both too young ( it seems ) for Read more + <p> No , we are n't  retirement age yet : ) We have either worked or enrolled in school in order to live in Thailand for several years , just as the laws have always allowed . Our Non Immigrant Visas do not require us to return back home for renewal . You can apply for a single-entry visa in any country whereas you DO need to go home if you are on a multiple entry visa such as an METV or a retirement visa . We can understand your friends frustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical requirements they can apply for Read more + <p> i have a round trip ticket booked from edmonton , canada to bangkok thailand . feb 10 , to april 26. we are not planning on staying in thailand the whole time ( probably only 3 weeks ) , and then will be going to philippines and bali. but because our flight shows that we will be in thailand for 2.5 months do we need a visa for this whole time ? TIA <p> Nope . Assuming you 're Canadian , you will get a free visa exempt stamp ( good for 30 days at a time ) at the airport when you pass through the immigration check point and the officers wont ask to see your flight tickets . No need to apply in advance for a single entry tourist visa bc your flight says you 'll be there for 2.5 months . Have a fun trip ! <p> Thailand offers Non Immigrant visas which are good for roughly one year intervals . As long as you meet the requirements ( age , income , working ability , etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite awhile . That 's how we stay so long on Non Immigrant visas . <p> I 'm really confused about new single entry visa up to 3 months . If we want to stay in Thailand for 3 months we will book a flight out for end of 3 months but original visa is valid for 60 days . Will there be any issues if flight itinerary is at end of 3 months instead of 60 days ? Also am I able to go to travel agent to handle the 30 day extension ? Thanks for your help ! Love your blog . <p> There is no need to go to a travel agent to extend your single-entry tourist visa . You can put together the paperwork ( the form , photocopies of your passport , and a photograph ) by yourself and go straight to an immigration office ( one in every province ) . Thai officials just want to see that you are leaving the country after your visit ; there should be no issue if your flight itinerary is after 3 months and not 60 days . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this information . We are trying to decide what country to move to as " young expats " too . And so much info on staying there legally long term is geared toward retirees . I wish there was info like this for every country we are considering . <p> Thank you for this very clearly explained information , which has helped me clear up some of my own misconceptions . I have heard something that has me a little worried and hope you may be able to help clear it up for me . My family and I ( US passport holders ) entered Thailand overland from Malaysia and got a 30 day exemption stamp . That time is almost up , and we are leaving to go to Cambodia to see Angkor Wat . We were planning to return overland and stay a bit longer in Thailand , and were under the impression we would be able Read more + <p> American passport holders ( in fact , anyone from the G7 countries , yhere are other countries like Ausralia who can only get 15 by land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa-exempt stamp by land AND air . The proof is that you recieved 30 days when you entered Thailand overland from Malaysia : ) When you are finished in Cambodia , you will be eligible for a brand new 30 day visa-exempt stamp when you cross back into Thailand by land . There is no need to apply for a single-entry tourist visa ! <p> Currently ( Dec 2015 ) the visa rules for passport holders of the G7 Nations ( Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , USA and UK ) get a 30 day visa-exempt stamp when they enter Thailand for both air and land . There is a list of countries who get a 30 day visa-exempt stamp by air but only 15 days by land . Luckily as a UK citizen , you will get a 30 day visa-exempt stamp no matter what . <p> You say this post " If you get a double or triple entry tourist visa , you can stay up 180 or 270 days , respectively , in Thailand without having to do a visa run . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand for 180 on a double entry visa . But this is not the case , you still have to leave after a maximum of 90 days . <p> Luke , you are correct . Although , we did n't  say that people can stay for 180 or 270 days without leaving , but that they do n't  have to do visa runs . A visa run is when you go to a neighboring country to apply for a new visa . A border run is when you cross the border every 90 days to begin the next entry on your visa . Hope this makes sense : ) <p> Great information ! I have a conundrum . I just crossed from Myanmar to Thailand by land , and my partner and I both got a month visa exempt stamp . It surprised us both ! However our daughter only got the standard 14 days . We only noticed this recently and are now wondering if we have to leave earlier than expected ? She is 18 months , so were hoping it wont be too serious if we overstay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immigration office . It seems really strange that they would stamp the passports differently , especially for an infant . It might be worth the effort to get it straightened out before the 14 days are up . <p> Its well worth a shot to try to get it straightened out at immigration , especially if you and your partner ( parents ) clearly have a different stamp than an infant . We had the same thing happen to us when we came back from a recent trip fro Laos . They stamped Chris with a 30 visa exempt stamp while they stamped me back in on my long term visa . We both had presented the border agent with a re-entry permit but he messed up . Luckily we got it fixed right then and there . Good luck ! <p> I went to apply for my Visa today and was only able to get a single entry ! So just need to know if there would have been a better way around it for a longer stay . I leave Australia April 7th to Delhi , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to my yoga course in Rishikesh ( which goes until May 6th ) . I leave for Thailand on May 6th and arrive morning of the 7th in CM . Apparently I could have applied for the double entry in Delhi , but I would n't have been around to collect it Read more + <p> How about this : you already spent time and money investing in a single entry Thai tourist visa , which will be good for 60 days . That Thai tourist visa will still be good to use after your trip to India ( since it takes 90 days to expire after the date of issuance ) . Stay in Thailand for two months , and on the 59th or 60th day , do a border run .

Using the 3 entry visa My plan is arrive in Thailand April 5th , stay for 60 days , 2 weeks in Myanmar , back to Thailand activate my 2nd entry and stay for anything upto the 60 day limit , then head to laos Vietnam Cambodia . But this will Read more + <p> Thanks for the reply guys , very helpful . I think what I will do is probably get a dual entry ( **25;0;TOOLONG ) then head to Laos Vietnam and Cambodia , then do n't  have to worry about the 3rd entry and can just get a new entry visa from phnom penh when Im ready to head back in to Thailand . Does this sound correct ? ? Also will I have to show proof of onward travel when I first arrive or when I return back in from Myanmar considering my flight back to UK is a good 6 months from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's a good plan . When you apply for another visa in Phnom Penh , that 's when you 'll need to show proof of onward travel ( your flight back to the UK ) . You will technically need to show proof onward travel for your first double-entry Thai visa , so that will be your ticket to Myanmar . Sounds like you 've got this worked out ! <p> If your Thai visa expires while you are in a neighboring country , yes , you can absolutely get a new visa from the Thai Consulars office . If anything , you can get back into Thailand on a 30 day visa exempt stamp . Please keep in mind that Thailands neighboring countries are n't  very generous about giving out triple entry Thai tourist visas . Your best bet is to try in Vientiane , Laos for a double entry , but other countries will most likely give a single entry Thai tourist visa . Have a wonderful trip ! <p> Some really valuable , clearly defined and up-to-date information on your web site well done and thank you . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , get a Thai visa in Thailand !

We should have clarified most people have asked if they can get it at an immigration office in Thailand or their home countrys embassy in Thailand . Thanks for the extra info ! <p> Great article !

Since I will be in Bangkok about 42 days after my initial arrival Read more + <p> You will be granted the 30 day visa- exempt stamp both times you enter Thailand on your initial flight from the US and when you are re-entering from Cambodia . You can also stay up to another 30 days in Thailand after your trip to Cambodia , so there is no need to rush off to the airport right away . The counter restarts each time you enter Thailand ( for your case ) . Itll be hassle free . Have a great trip ! <p> I 'm doing something similar to this .

Great site BTW ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela , I am wondering if you can combine a free 30 day visa with a single entry tourist visa . I am planning on going to Thailand for about 2 1/2 weeks , leaving for a week , and then re-entering Thailand with the hope of staying 2 months . Could I say get a 30 day visa for the first part and then use a tourist visa for the second part ? Could I get a tourist visa in Vietnam ( where I currently am ) but " save it " for the second half of the trip ? Seems like it may be easier to Read more + <p> We are planning to visit Thailand on January . As we are from Slovenia , we are allowed to stay in country for 30 days visa-free . However we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first week of our Thai trip . I was wandering how it works with all this re-entry process . Ive read somewhere that once you leave Thailand and then return back by land , you have only 14 days to leave country . Is this true ? Do we have to get some kind of re-entry permit ? <p> If you entered Thailand on a visa ( say , a tourist visa ) you would be eligible for a re-entry permit . In that case , before you go on your Cambodia trip , you would go to your Thai Immigration Office ( there is one in every province i.e. , state ) and apply for a re-entry permit for 1000 baht . It should only take a few hours to wait and apply for . In your case , if you enter without a tourist visa and instead on a visa-exempt stamp ( visa-free ) , you are not eligible for a re-entry permit ( you must have an actually visa ) . However , after you Read more + <p> My wife and I are in Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 9 days and then returning to Thailand for the final 16 days or so of our 3 month trip .

Will we have a problem getting Read more + <p> We understand your concern about the visa thing . Itll be clear that you are tourists visiting Thailand because you 'll only have one Thai tourist visa in your passport , so clearly you are n't  trying to take advantage of the system and doing multiple visa or border runs to Thailand .

However , I thought the visa exempt stamp was only good for 14 days when crossing into the Kingdom by land . I know for sure it was 3 Years ago when I spent a lot of good time here in Thailand . And with that , no extensions were permitted . <p> A lot has changed regarding visas is the past year alone . These are the current policies and guidelines . Always do your own research regarding your country of citizenship prior to traveling . Take care ! <p> The difference on giving out double/multiple entry visas between different Thai consulates is really interesting ! I am Australian and am visiting Canada with my Canadian husband this month . I went and picked up our triple entry visas today from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky enough to be in the right country to get the triple entry visas . <p> It IS intriguing that each Thai Embassy and Consulate make their own rules . Even as an Australian ( and Australia only gives a double entry max ) its good to know that you can visit Canada and still get the golden triple entry visa ! <p> Super point on the border run versus visa run . 2 different things ; I sometimes mixed the terms but both are very different . As for the extension I did that twice during my recent 6 month stay . Once in Chiang Mai , once in Phuket , and a border run from Pranburi to activate in-between . <p> I had no idea that it was so complex ! Its good to know we can request a visa exempt stamp . We just spent $190 for visas for Vietnam while we were in Sydney and was n't looking forward to spending a ton for Thailand as well . <p> HI Chris &amp; Angela , quick question : What are your thoughts on obtaining a work permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are planning our move .

Can I obtain these documents before arriving , from my Thai Consulate ? I live Read more + <p> Its a good idea for your husband to teach and therefore be on a non-immigrant business B visa and granted a work permit , while you and your daughter are eligible for non-immigrant dependent O visas . You will not be able to get the respective B and O visas before your move unless your husband has accepted a job and the hiring company/school mails him the correct paperwork for him to take to the Thai Consulate in Canada . Its possible to do this , but not common . Its more realistic that the three of you move here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation ! Just an FYI for Americans wanting a tourist visa . The NYC consulate is only giving out double entry tourists visas right now ( no triple entry ) . My husband and I got one two weeks ago with no troubles at all ! Good luck to all ! <p> We just got ours 3 weeks ago in Portland , OR in the US . It was $80 for a 90 day visa . She recommended that one . Were now in Kata and heading to Rawai for 2 months before touring the rest of the country . I did n't  see anything above alluding to that as an option but it worked for us ! <p> Congrats on your trip . What you received in Portland was a 60 day visa w/ the option to extend for 30 days . Just make sure you head to immigration sometime before your initial 60 days is up and extend your visa for the additional 30 days . Should cost you about 1900 Baht each . Good luck , safe travels , and enjoy ! <p> Excellent article ! Recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package it all in bundle and advertise a " Visa 101 " booklet ( or something similar ) on the forums and sell it for a nominal charge .

Much appreciated . <p> I love your emphasis on pointing out the difference between a visa exempt stamp and an actual visa . Its a pet peeve of mine when people lazily refer to the exemption as a " tourist visa on arrival " . As for Permanent Residency and Thai Citizenship , I 've heard that citizenship is actually the easier to get of the two . There is a common misconception that one is required to get permanent residency before applying for citizenship , but this is not the case .

We are looking to go in on a Retirement Visa at least we can stay there for a year and not have to leave if we did n't  want to .. <p> If you have a choice between a non-immigrant visa ( retirement or business ) and a tourist visa , the retirement visa is the absolute easiest .

The Thai Embassy in Australia does n't  seem to be offering multiple three-entry visas right now ( only two entry visas ) according to the Sydney Thai Consulate site . I wonder if a three entry visa is still available to Australians . <p> Yes , you 're right . Each embassy can make their own rules about how many entries they give out . They are n't  giving out triple entry to Australians either , as confirmed by one of our readers in early May .

@@59574519 @8574519/ <h> Is it safe to eat Thai street food ? <p> Our very first meal in Thailand " ever " was coughed up from a food stall on Bangkoks infamous Soi Cowboy . It was sometime after- midnight and the vendor handed us a Styrofoam bowl filled with threadlike- rice noodles , a clear pinkish broth ( caused by the neon lighting ? ) , a handful of rust red gelatinous squares ( dyed tofu , perhaps ? ) , and a few boiled chicken wings . We were hungry , traveled over thirty hours from the USA to Thailand , but nonetheless thought it was safe to eat Thai street food . <p> What happened to our GI tracts the next day ? - Well , nothing really . We got up bright and early , ate our safe complimentary breakfast from our hotel around the corner from Soi Cowboy , and out we went to explore the streets of Bangkok . <h> What We Did Right <p> Were you expecting that wed be spending the next 24 hours- battling over the toilet and experiencing the equivalent of- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sorry to disappoint you ! <p> Maybe we got lucky with that particular bowl of noodles or maybe ordering from that vendor was n't as reckless as it sounds . Eating at Thai street stalls , push carts , or food vendors seems to be- synonymous with food poisoning , but that has n't  been our experience . <p> We think its safe to eat Thai street food and would like to attribute our happy bellies that particular night ( along with countless other evenings eating at food stalls ) to- several calculated- decisions . <h> TIP 1 : Look for the vendor with a long line <p> Long lines usually mean satisfied recurring customers . We are n't  doubting that the food tastes good , but its important that the people who are frequenting these stalls are n't  getting sick . When looking at lines , we also- give precedence to those that have several- local Thais in them over lines solely composed of tourists . Not only does this suggest that the Thai street food is safe but that the flavors havent been toned down to satisfy foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walked by several food stalls and most of them had few , if any , customers . We noticed one vendor with- several Thai people standing in line so we gravitated there . Though we did n't  have a clue to what the lady was serving , we figured that was a good a choice as any if she had several people waiting . <p> To minimize the chance of an upset stomach , we typically pass on the bowls or pans of ready-made food that we 've assumed to have been cooked hours in advance but- are on display uncovered in the ambient temperature . The only exception is if we see the vendor just setting out the bowls and were among- the first customers of the day . <p> What we do eat are stir-fries that have been cooked in a sizzling wok right in front of us , skewers of meat , fish , or shellfish that are actively cooking on a- fiery grill , or soups that have been- ladled- from a near-boiling cauldron . If its served to us hot , we are more confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the piping hot bowl of noodle soup from the Soi Cowboy vendor regardless of its unfamiliar contents was a seemingly safe choice . <p> Most food stall vendors specialize in one food type , whether its beef noodle soup , stewed pork leg , or banana roti and then offer a few variations . You can count on these vendors to buy their fresh ingredients regularly- and then close up business when their stash runs out . With such a high turnover rate , there 's less- time for the ingredients to spoil . That 's very different from the ground beef or semi-thawed shrimp that have sat in a restaurants walk-in refrigerator for the past two weeks . <h> TIP 4 : Use good judgement <p> Food hygiene standards in Thailand are different from Western countries that 's stating the obvious . You wo n't see vendors checking food temperatures with thermometers or dishes- covered by- food trays . There may even be *heaven forbid* street dogs or stray cats hanging around- the- food stalls . <p> So if you are browsing among food stall vendors , common sense goes a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors are unhygienic and careless with how they handle the food , casually observe them- before buying anything . Is the work station generally- clean ? Is the raw meat kept in a cooler before being cooked ? Does the vendor use a different hand or tool to touch the food than- the cash ? Do the ingredients look bright and moist and not dull and limp ? Are hundreds of people eating from the food stalls ? - If the answer is yes to these questions , then order something ! <h> TIP 5 : Ice should have a hole in it <p> Many people fear the ice in Thailand . We can only image how many hot and thirsty visitors have turned down an iced drink in favor of a room temperature canned soda or a hot coffee because they were afraid the ice would make them sick . <p> Good news ! Its possible to determine- what ice is safe to drink in Thailand by its shape . We suggest steering clear of crushed ice and keep an eye out for ice that 's in large , uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a telltale sign that the cubes- have been made from filtered water at an ice factory and not hacked or shaved from a block of ice with a potentially unsanitary- blade . <p> When we sat down outside at one of the bars that flanked Soi Cowboy with our bowls of soups and ordered a round of beers ( which is allowed in Thailand ! ) we were surprised to have two glasses of ice plopped down beside us . We had heard that its customary to drink beer with ice because the beer warms up too quickly . As it turned out , the ice were large cylinders with a big hole down the middle . When in Rome ! <h> TIP 6 : Drink bottled water <p> Drinking bottled water in Thailand is the way to go . Accessibility wont be a- problem because- the locals drink it , too , particularly in major towns that have proper bottled water distribution- shops . But most vendors do n't  sell plastic bottles of water at their stalls . Instead , vendors- set up free , self-serve coolers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep your eyes out for- a rack of metal or plastic cups to drink from and a large , typically round cooler beside it . The cooler either directly dispenses water or it has a removable top with which water can be scooped out with a ladle . An obvious sign that filtered water has been used is the 40L water jug ( similar to the kind at your offices watering hole back home ) sitting off to the side of the vendor , which was purchased from a bottled water facility . <h> Have we ever gotten sick ? <p> Yes , in the three years living here , we both have gotten sick . Chris once and I twice . We werent able to avoid stomach bugs entirely . <p> Within a few months of officially moving to Thailand , I- had a one week-long stomach illness that resulted in regular intervals of stabbing stomach pains . The culprit was either a mango and yogurt shake or a shrimp a vegetable stir-fry from street stalls in Chiang Mai . The second time I got sick was from chicken- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pharmacist down the street for- antibiotics. - Chris , on the other hand , just recently had a 36 hour debilitating bug ( well spare you the details ) after eating a charcuterie and cheese plate at an Italian restaurant in Krabi . <p> All three situations were different once from a food stall , once from an upscale restaurant , and once from a home cooked meal and all were supposedly safe because there no obvious signs to us that the food was spoiled or that it had been mishandled . But sh*t happens , pun intended ! <p> This is not to say that every other time we 've eaten Thai food things have- been , er , regular . It took our stomachs about one- month of eating Thai street food once every other day to adjust to the flood of new ingredients and different strains of bacteria on the other side of the world . Even if we had previously believed to have possessed iron stomachs . <p> To this day we are n't  sure what type of noodle soup we ate on Soi Cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really blood cake and suspect the pink broth was colored by red bean paste . But we figured we must have made some smart decisions that night and it certainly makes for an entertaining story ! <p> Hi i am planing my first trip to Thailand and Cambodia this year , I was married to a Chinese man and I know what he liked when it came to Chinese food and i was willing to try anything apart from Cat and Monkey , but since then I have become a vegetarian will it be easy to find street food for a veggie ? thanks x <p> Absolutely . Chiang Mai is particularly vegetarian- and vegan-friendly . Keep any eye out for the symbols aa+ ( pronounced jay ) which means vegetarian food . These two letters are often written in red letters with a yellow background . <p> Wow , the Ice cube with a whole in it . Not heard of that one but will certainly look out for that one . Have you guys been around the Market in Bang Rak ? Was in the neighborhood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fantastic fry ups but only mornings as it shuts down at 11:30AM . Oh and I found a cooking class as well right in the middle ! Was brilliant ! http : **29;27;TOOLONG <p> We first started to travel to Thailand in 2008 , the first time we went we were to scared to try the street food which looked amazing . When we went back the year after and every year since we have become more brave to try street food . I have to say use common sense its not hard to choose which are the best places to eat . We adore street food always cooked fresh in front of us , i must say i love the nutella and banana pancakes .. yummy . <p> This article is great ! We will be in Bangkok for 2 days . Then we are traveling to the Krabi area and islands where we will be staying in nice hotels and resorts . What do you recommend we do for food at the resorts ? I 'm so terrified of getting sick , I might get the Hep A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just use your best judgement watch the staff how they handle the food , if its put on ice , if its fresh looking , smells good , etc . Do n't  eat something if you are suspicious . Wishing you a good trip with no tummy ailments ! <p> Something that I saw when I was in Thailand that I wanted to try was the meats/sausages on the grill . I was wary because some were already cooked , while others were currently cooking on the grill . How can I eat these while making sure I wont get sick ? <p> Go for the ones that have just come off the grill . Watch the vendors cook them in front of you not just a quick reheat , but make sure they grab raw skewers out of the cooler and cook them right then and there . There are sour pork sausages ( fermented but not really cooked ) and other local sausages that we eat that we would n't recommend if its your first time traveling here . <p> Drinks are made from filtered water . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . If you 're concerned , best to avoid any fruit or veggies than ca n't be peeled . This includes a raw dish like som tum because the long beans and tomatoes may have been washed with tap water , although the green papaya itself must be peeled first before getting shred . <p> Love these fantastic , fun and informative posts guys . You have been a source of much hilarity and knowledge ( not necessarily in that order ) since we first decided to relocate to Thailand for a few months . I am happy to recommend people joining your posts if they need info on living Thai style . Totally love the street food here ! The walking markets especially have allowed us to explore and try out all sorts of amazing treats ( Chim Dai Mai is one of my favourite phrases " Can I try Some ? " ) . We have only had one bad experience where my daughter vomited through Read more + <p> I m must say , this is the best post Ive seen about eating street food . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of tips but you got it all covered . I will add though that many people I know who have suffered food poisoning largely blame it on prawns . <p> We now proceed with caution when eating seafood anywhere other than beach towns . However , we play catch up and eat fish , squid , and crabs at least once a day whenever we travel down south . Were still somewhat wary of shrimp <p> I love the food in Thailand . I have been to Chiang Mai many times and they do have many very good vegetarian restaurants . The best one is A Taste of Heaven in Tha Phae Rd . They also do the best cooking school there , even my son who is not a vegetarian said the food I cooked in the school there was better than the school he attended . The next time we went to Chiang Mai the whole family went to the cooking school at A Taste of Thai and none except myself are vegetarians . I always eat the street food Read more + <p> I got really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about yellow mango and alcohol mix can be bad for your healthalso if I remember right the durian with alcohol can kill you . : o <p> Weve heard about the combo of durian and alcohol can kill you , too ! Although you probably wo n't find us eating copious amount of that stinky fruit ( a few bites will do ) while drinking beer or cocktails well stick to chips or pretzels : ) <p> Spoken like true Thais ! It is always best to eat in food establishments where you can see the food being prepared . The joy of eating street food , trumps the hazards for me although I always try to be prudent . I went with 7 Thais for a weekend at Villa Narwin . On the way there , we stopped at a roadside open-air restaurant in Sri Racha to feast on a type of cockle . There were two Thai grannies in our group and once they saw that I liked the cockles , they competed to see who could shuck the most for me Read more + <p> Wwwhhoooaa , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are wary of shellfish but are willing to eat them if they are popped open with both shells the telltale sign that they were alive when cooked . The cockles are a different story bc you still have to pry them open prior to eating . We feel bad for your friends but are glad you did n't  get sick : / <p> Ive been eating street food in SEA since 2000 , and a lot of it in Chiang Mai . I 'm happy to day that I 've never gotten sick from any of it . In fact , the only time Ive gotten sick was in Taiwan , and that was from eating at a MacDonalds ! Your tips are right on . <p> Ulgh , both of us tossed our cookies after eating McDs in the USA it can happen even in first world countries ! And Chris is now wondering if what made him sick recently was the Burger King instead of the Italian restaurant ! Open aired food stalls have a stigma but people often forget about the poor food handling that goes unseen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do wish there were more vegetarian/vegan options , but I also realize we non meat eaters are in the minority , and vendors need to follow the money to stay in business . For those that want to eat healthy and eat meat , you can request no sugar or salt added to the stir fry , but beware the batter for fried chicken and some other deep fried foods usually have sugar added ( it sells better that way ) cheers : ) <p> Supposedly Chiang Mai offers tons of vegetarian and vegan options and its a popular topic among travel bloggers passing through the city . We think Thai fried chicken is the best and we do n't  doubt that sugar and even MSG is used to make it so delicious which were totally ok with . We just treat ourselves every once in awhile : ) <p> I totally agree with you : 1 ) local street stalls cook right in front of your eyes , unlike restaurants : you do n't  see what 's happening in the kitchen ! ! ! 2 ) stalls or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to lose their **27;58;TOOLONG 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574521 @8574521/ <h> Unforgettable Things to Do in Koh Lanta <p> Even though we 've taken many trips to Krabi Province , it took us nearly three years to finally visit Koh Lanta . Big names in that area of the Andaman Sea include Phuket and Koh Phi Phi , but we ended up gravitating towards the island that 's not on travelers radars as often . As it turned out , there are a great mix of things to do in Koh Lanta without the overcrowding usually experienced on the more popular islands . Count us in ! <p> Our first impression of the island was that its a one size fits all kind of place . There are cheap bungalows and quality resorts to fit any budget . <p> Koh Lanta was easy to navigate on its wide , flat , properly paved roads , so its comfortable to drive a rental car or a motorbike . It was easier than the challenging hills of Koh Chang and safer to drive on than crowded roads of Koh Samui . There were also motorcycle taxis ( with sidecars ) to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west side of the island has beach after beach after beach . Some are quiet stretches such as Nui Bay Beach and Bamboo Bay Beach and are perfect for sunbathing or having a peaceful moment . Although we could have lounged on the sand for the week , we took the opportunity to check out some of the local activities unique to the area . <h> Snorkeling at Koh Rok <p> Weve been snorkeling several times but our latest and favorite place to snorkel in Thailand so far has been off Koh Rok . We 've heard it had some of the best snorkeling in the Andaman Sea so we decided to give it a whirl . We saw plenty of colorful fish species and cool textured coral at three different reefs . The water was very clear and warm , too . Our snorkeling company , Opal Speedboat , definitely knew where the good spots were . <p> The island is actually two sister islands , Koh Rok Nai and Koh Rok Nok . We had lunch on Koh Rok Nai ( there 's a ranger station and a camping area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a postcard . You know , turquoise waters and blinding white sand ? We would love to go back there again just to experience more of that . <h> Emerald Cave at Koh Muk <p> Another unique place to visit is the Emerald Cave . Accessible only by boat , we jumped into the water and swam towards the cave . The entrance was a bright emerald-green color that slowly darkened as we swam through the cave . Its about a two or three minutes swim but you need a flashlight ( provided by a tour guide ) because at one point it turns pitch black ! Then it opens up into a small lagoon and beach area surrounded by towering cliffs , which is inside the island . <p> Both full day activities ( the Four Island Hop during which you see the Emerald Cave and snorkeling at Koh Rok ) can be arranged through Opal Speedboat for 1,700 baht per person . The price includes lunch , equipment , and hotel pickup . <h> Walk a Dog on the Beach <p> A very popular activity on Koh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered along the islands main road , is spending time with cats and dogs at the Lanta Animal Welfare . Founded by the same woman who runs the well-known Time for Lime Cooking School , this a safe place for the islands rescued strays and abandoned cats and dogs . <p> The Lanta Animal Welfare is open from 9:30am to 5pm daily . All animals are immediately available for adoption . If you cant make that big of a commitment , you can spend an hour of your day and cuddle with a cat or take a dog for a walk on the beach . Come between 9:30am to 11am and again from 3pm to 5pm to volunteer walk . All services are completely free but donations are appreciated . <h> Beachside Massage <p> These are best found by strolling along the beach and dropping in on a no-name shop . We ate at El Greco Greek Taverna on Klong Khong Beach and there was a massage shop right beside it . There was another massage shop beside Mr. Wees Pizzeria on Long Beach . Mind you that they run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to 200 or 250 baht for non-beach side massages ) but to be fair , you 're paying for the novelty of the experience and the view ! <p> There were other water sports and beachy things to do that we saw pamphlets for but did n't  have the chance to do them ourselves : <p> The two of us ate lunch there after first hearing about it from our friend Alana from Paper Planes Blog . We enjoyed the attentive service by the friendly owners ( something we sorely miss since moving to Thailand ) and the huge GINORMOUS , delicious portions . Try the mousaka and the soulvaki and make sure to come hungry . <p> In fact , we liked El Greco so much that we went there a second time a week later with our 25+ person group from the Yacht Week Thailand . They were able to accommodate our group within an hours notice and we think its fair to say that everyone was blown away by the generous quantity and quality of their meals . <h> Happy Hour Sunset Cocktails <p> Koh Lanta is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront property . We came across two fabulous albeit upscale places to enjoy cocktails and watch the sunset . Both spots were right on the beach but on opposite ends of the island . Of course , there are about a million options to choose from to watch the sunset , but these two caught our eye while we were scouting things out and were glad we went . <h> Rak Talae Beach Bar <p> Our first stop was Rak Talae Beach Bar at Pimalai Resort situated on Katiang Bay Beach near the southern tip of the island . Thanks to a recommendation made to us on Facebook , we decided to scope it out . It was a bit of a challenge ( the guard in front of the resort at first would not let us in , and then front desk staff members and even the server asked us what room we were in , to which we replied , " We are visiting friends . " ) <p> Nonetheless , we managed to snag a table and enjoyed the perfect tropical drink called a Coconut Dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with vodka , Malibu rum , coconut milk , pineapple juice , and lime . It was expensive ( 385 ! baht per specialty drink ) but the Happy Hour deal of buy one get one from 5pm to 6:30pm sweetened the deal . Make sure to dress nicely ! <h> Reggae Bar <p> Another awesome viewpoint was the Reggae Bar at Crown Lanta . A short ride from the front desk in a little buggy took us to a stunning place overlooking a rocky private beach . Full of smooth stones of various sizes , it made for a very pretty spot to catch the sunset . There are four different areas to enjoy drinks : right on the beach with Thai style woven mats and pillows , thatched-roof pavilions , deck side tables , and even tree houses ! Happy Hour is available everyday from 6:30pm to 7:30pm and drinks are half price ( full price run around 220 baht per mixed drink ) . <h> Visit Old Town <p> Old Town is very small , but if you are on the island for more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its worth swinging by and walking through the towns old-time wooden Thai shophouses . <h> Adult Smoothies <p> While meandering down the short strip of restaurants , we stopped by a small smoothie stand not far from Pintos . Here the lady proudly makes fruit smoothies with a variety of liquors . For 100 baht each we had a pineapple mojito with Bacardi and were quite happy ! It was certainly an unexpected treat and a good way to cool off from the midday heat . <h> Evening Fun <p> Koh Lantas party scene is n't on the same level as Koh Phi Phi or Koh Phangan but it still has a good night life . Bar hopping opportunities are definitely available and we 'd argue the best ( er , safest ) method is to choose one of the more commercialized beaches and walk along them to explore the bars . This beats taking a motorbike at night especially because the roads are not well lit after dark . The best beaches to go bar hopping are areas of Long Beach , Klong Khong Beach , and Kantiang Bay Beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large outdoor bar with a restaurant and tables and bar that spill out onto Kantiang Beach . Big jellyfish lanterns and lighting were strung around for ultracool ambiance . And of course , it is n't a beach party without some fire dancing ! <h> Pangea Beach Bar <p> Pangea Beach Bar is small beach bar on Long Beach but had plenty of very attentive bartenders that knew how to pour a proper drink for around 150 baht a pop . They also serve up infamous buckets if you 're ready for it ! Live DJs play alternative and underground music on Tuesdays and Sundays . <p> We later found out that Klapa Klum Bar has DJs playing dance music on Wednesdays and Korner Bar is the place to be on Saturdays if you like late night dancing . Both of these bars are on Klong Khong Beach . Funky Monkey on Long Beach is good to go to on Friday nights if you like karaoke . <h> Where to Stay in Koh Lanta <p> There are plenty of accommodations on Koh Lanta ranging from bungalows to hi-so resorts . Its worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) its possible to find places at half the price as peak tourist season . That 's when we prefer to do our traveling in the south and suggest you do the same for the best deals ! <p> We stayed at the Crown Lanta Resort &amp; Spa , a four star resort with a private beach , on-site spa , a delicious complimentary Western breakfast and gorgeous rooms . We liked that it was one of the first resorts on the island after getting off the ferry in Saladan . Also , we rented a motorbike through Crown Lanta to explore the island with and it was a breeze to do . If you 're looking for a place with comfort and great quality , read about our experience at the resort . <p> If we were to pick a budget-friendly two star bungalow , we 'd probably opt for the Raven Blue Hotel or the Andawa Lanta House . Past guests have raved about the how clean and comfortable the rooms are and how great the staff are . <h> Other Things to Do in Koh Lanta <p> We werent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , but we did run into the Editor in Chief of the Koh Lanta Pocket Guide , Mr. Pete at Why Not Bar . He gave us a free copy of the guide which included tons of helpful tips and things to do in Koh Lanta such as : <p> We really liked Crown Lanta . Our room was impeccable and the breakfast was awesome . We also liked that it was so close to the pier that after our long drive and ferries to the island we were one of the first guests to be dropped off .

@@59574522 @8574522/ <h> How to Eat Thai Food 101 <p> With friends visiting from out-of-town , we thought that now would be the perfect time to explain- how to eat Thai food . Although we wont be diving into the intricacies , we 've brushed up on Thailands- utensils , condiments , and dining etiquette , which is a bit different from not only what were used to back home , but other Asian cuisines . <h> Utensils <p> Contrary to how many people may think all Asian cuisine is eaten , - Thai food is typically eaten with a spoon and fork , not chopsticks ! - Food is- typically sliced into bite sized pieces that - can be easily handled with these two utensils . No knife is needed . <p> But why both a fork and a spoon ? Thais typically hold the spoon in their dominant hand and use the fork to guide food onto the spoon , and then the- spoon goes into the mouth . <p> When we first were learning how to eat Thai food , we were tempted to keep the fork in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon as a scoop . We figured out soon enough that 's not quite how to do it , although it still works just as well . <p> For soups and soup-like dishes , Thai food is served with chopsticks and a Chinese soup spoon . An example of a dish eaten with chopsticks is khao soi , a northern Thai noodle curry dish . <p> Hold the chopsticks in your dominate hand and the soup spoon in the other. - Eat directly from the chopsticks and sip on the broth using the soup spoon . Or , use the chopsticks to pick up bits of meat , veggies , and noodles and place a small amount of each in the spoon . Scoop up some broth and eat from the soup spoon for the perfect bite ! <p> Another favorite of ours is beef noodle soup , which is served with fresh sliced of beef and thin or fat rice noodles in a clear broth . This dish is- also eaten with chopsticks and a Chinese soup spoon . <p> Sticky rice , believe it or not , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of sticky rice about the size of a quarter , flatten it a bit between your ( clean ) fingers and create an indentation in the center , and then sandwich it around the shreds of meat and veggies . Its also great for mopping up sauce . <h> Thai Condiments <p> Salt , pepper , sugar caddies , and sometimes ketchup typically sit on restaurant tables back home . But in Thailand , there are a different set of condiments . You can typically find small dishes containing sugar , dried red chili flakes , white vinegar ( often containing slices of fresh chilies ) , and fish sauce . Sometimes there 's even MSG on the table , which looks like long thin grains of- salt . <p> Sometimes there will be a small dish of homemade fish sauce and sliced hot Bird 's Eye Chilies , often accompanied by fresh lime slices and cloves of garlic . <p> Angelas favorite condiment is the fresh hot chilies scooped out of the fish sauce . Chris 's favorite condiment is the dried red chili flakes . <h> Etiquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with toilet paper on the table tops , not napkins . <p> Thai food can be- spicy , so its not unusual to find yourself reaching for a napkin when your nose starts running . But wait , do n't  blow your nose . Instead of honking away , simply wipe . A soft , quiet blow is also acceptable . We 've never witnessed a local Thai blast away , but when tourists do it , its so disrupting that we feel- embarrassed for them ! <p> In addition to condiments and napkins , toothpicks also often make their debut onto tabletops . If case you need to get rid of something between your teeth , do n't pick your teeth with your fingers or a utensil . Instead , grab a toothpick and cover your mouth with your other hand . Although for a moment we look like we are playing a baby harmonica , its better- being discrete . <h> Interactive Eating <p> Those whove eaten Thai food know it can be highly interactive . In other words , there can be quite a bit of finger food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lettuce , herbs , spring onions , long beans , to name a few ) are placed- on the table- to be eaten- along- with your dish . Its kind of like a salad , crunchy and refreshing . <p> It is also not uncommon for meat to be left on the bones . Slow cooked dishes may include rough cut pieces of meat with bones , cartilage , and skin intact . You- have to- work hard for the edible parts , especially for something such as oxtail or chicken feet . <h> Have Fun Learning How to Eat Thai Food <p> Our visiting friends were relieved to know that they would be using chopsticks a lot less than- they thought . See , Thai food is easier to eat than some people realize ! Taking some time to figure out how to eat Thai food is a surefire way to fully enjoy what 's already a delicious cuisine . <p> Great post guys . Having just been in Hua Hin for two weeks now and starting to eat where the locals eat , we were wondering about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in HH so it has been a bit hit and miss so far . We are slowly but surely figuring out what the different tastes and flavours are , and loving it .

I was bought up eating a lot of Thai food in the UK but it did n't  even come close to the real thing absolutely delicious . I cant wait to return to Chiang Mai for the Khao Soi ( and so many other reasons ) . <p> Thanks for the compliment ! Thai food still differs wildly here in Chiang Mai because this town is so popular with expats ( no chilies , less spices and garlic , more coconut milk or water ) , but that 's mostly on the main strips around the moat . Luckily we have our favorite places that are n't  afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ! <p> I was pregnant in Thailand , and eating was my biggest challenge . Thai food in Thailand is very different thank Thai food in Canada ! It took me over two months to figure out that the smell of fish sauce made me nauseous . It got better eventually , but by then it was time to go home . I cant wait to return as a non-pregnant person : ) <p> Wow ! We can only imagine ! Fish sauce is the base of most dishes and although we love the taste of fish sauce now , the smell is still pretty awful . We hope your non-pregnant senses can appreciate Thai food without getting nauseous ! <p> Sometimes the spiciness simply overcomes the capacious farang nose . Sometimes there really is no choice but to let er rip . I was trying to just dab at a rather formal dinner last time I was there , and so delayed actual blowing . The results were disasterously disgusting , even for a farang . I say that if you are farang and you got ta blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Sigh . Chalk this up to simply feeling bigger , clumsier , and all around less graceful than all the Thais around you . <p> I have to laugh because last time I was in Thailand , my " Aunt-in-law " told me I used chopsticks better that she did ! It was then I realized after thinking back that I really did n't  see her or other Thai folks eating with chopsticks very often . Its just not that common . Thanks for the Thai food photos ! Makes me very hungry ! Nom nom nom : ) <p> We were in for a surprise , too ! All those nights out for sushi , and it did n't  really matter once we moved here ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 5 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574523 @8574523/ <h> Bua Tong Sticky Waterfalls Chiang Mai <p> One of the most unique places weve ever been to in Thailand is called Bua Tong , or the Sticky Waterfalls . Located about an hour and a half drive north of Chiang Mais Old City , these waterfalls are not only impressive and gorgeous , but a special feature allows you to climb directly up the rocks into the oncoming cascading water ! <h> The Science Behind the Sticky Waterfalls <p> Waterfalls are notoriously slippery . Obviously one goes down a waterfall , in line with the gushing waters and typically slippery surfaces . So how is it possible to climb up the Sticky Waterfalls ? <p> The Sticky Waterfalls get their name from a mineral deposit that is incredibly grippy . In fact , the rocks feel like a hardened sponge . They are callous and even slightly prickly to the touch but surprisingly give a bit under pressure . Since no algae or slime adheres to the rocks , they are the perfect canvas to climb up the waterfall . It is impressively steep in some places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , we felt like Spider-Man ! <h> Brawn and Beauty <p> The Sticky Waterfalls are an impressive sight . The rocks are cream-colored and bulbous , almost cartoonish , and contrast beautifully with the dark green forest . And the water ? Crystal clear and cool . It comes from a mineral spring so the waterfall is present year-round . <p> The surrounding forest floor is coated with moss and small colorful flowers . There are plenty of forest creatures like butterflies and water bugs , and there are even the occasional minnows . <p> These multi-tiered waterfalls are easy on the eyes and a great way to cool off in Thailands heat . The are a challenge to your muscles , though ! If you do plan to climb these waterfalls , be prepared to work muscles in your legs and feet you never knew existed . Even if you do n't  plan on getting wet clambering over the rocks , there are a couple hundred steep stairs that take you down the various levels of waterfalls . Make sure to save your energy for the trip back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SriLanna National Forest , the Sticky Waterfalls is a great place for a picnic . There are drinks and light snacks for sale on the premises and clean , although Thai-styled , bathrooms . Food is not allowed down in the waterfall area . However , there are plenty of picnic tables with shade near the top area of the park entrance . <p> Alternatively , about a five minutes drive before arriving at the park is a small outdoor market with several open-aired restaurants . Vendors can whip up Thai meals to-go that you can take with you to the park . There are also grilled meats , fresh fruits , and some small packaged Thai snacks that are perfect for picnicking . <p> In addition to picnic items , make sure to bring : <p> Camera <p> Towels or change of clothes <p> Strap on sandals or water shoes <p> Tissues/toilet paper <h> How to Get to the Bua Tong Sticky Waterfalls in Chiang Mai <p> The trip from Chiang Mai to the Sticky Waterfalls is about an hour and a half . The attraction is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1001 , in the Sri Lanna National Park . <p> The drive is pretty easy . If you 're comfortable driving , we recommend renting a car- ( or a motorbike if you have riding experience ) and enjoy taking in the scenery on the way up . Otherwise , you can hail a songthaew - ( red truck taxi ) from main streets in the Old City and hire the driver for the day . A songthaew can fit up to eight people comfortably in the back . <p> The photos of this place hardly do it justice . Go there and see for yourself how amazing the waterfalls are . This was one of Angelas familys favorite places to visit in Chiang Mai during their two-week visit in March 2014 . We highly recommended checking it out ! <p> Yes , I think it not swimming . It climbing and it not dangerous for a child but I think at that time maybe not have water or just a little water . And about a mosquito in Thailand is very common please bring your protection . : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult . Itll be perfect for your little daughter to splash around in up to her ankles . The exception is the bottom tier of the waterfall ( its the very last one since you 're climbing down ) . It has a pool of water about mid-thigh deep . Its really clear and clean to go in , just be careful with her because its deep . There should n't be many mosquitos because it will still be smoky season in April the rains do n't  come until late May or early June . Have a WONDERFUL trip ! <p> I 'm heading here tomorrow !

Thanks for any advice ! <p> Yes , you 'd be able to squeeze in a trip to the waterfalls on the same day . We think the park closes at sunset ( 5pm or 6pm ? ) , so if you check into your hotel around 1pm and then head out ( an hours drive ) you 'll have 2-3 hours there , which is perfect . Have a great time ! <p> You can rent a motorbike or a car if you are comfortable driving in Thailand . We would recommend going with someone else as a safety precaution .

We hired a taxi for 1500 baht , for most of the day , he was very chatty , from a mountain village and had lots to tell us about northern Thailand . We were very happy with the price and service and loved the national park and waterfalls <p> Thank you for only recommending Elephant nature park for elephant experiences ! ! !

I 'm bringing a local friend and she does n't  like exerting herself much but I feel like its an easy hike . What do you think ? Do you have to hike from the parking lot to the waterfall or is it close to at least get to the first view ? <p> Hey ! It is about a one minute walk on flat ground to the first view point and about a 3 to 5 minute walk down big steps to get to the main waterfall area .

@@59574524 @8574524/ <h> Rong Kluea Market in Sa Kaeo , Thailand <p> In September we had the opportunity to stop off at Rong Kluea Market in the Aranyaprathet- District of Thailands Sa Kaeo Province . Also known as Ban Khlong Luek Border Market , it is said to be one of Thailands most frequented border markets . Being in the direct path of so many travelers making their way from Bangkok , Thailand to Siem Reap , Cambodia , that claim is not hard to believe . <p> UPDATE:Due to the recent Thai and Cambodian land disputes , the border market has been hit hard during October and November 2013 . We have heard reports that Rong Kluea Market has been partially shut down/removed , but according to recent articles it seems full trade may resume shortly as fears of violence and backlash over a International Court of Justices ruling- subside , - allowing for mixed trade to continue . We will update this post as the situation develops . <h> How Big is Rong Kluea Market ? <p> Right away it was clear to us that this was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire sprawling market would set you back 5 km or just over 3 mi . If you are n't  up for such a long walk there are roaming golf carts that are just biting at the bit to give you a ride .

The merchants here make livings out of cleaning , restoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothing . Most of these items were once donated to the people of Cambodia who later brought them to the border to sell and trade . <p> It is n't uncommon to see things like military uniforms and equipment strewn across entire alleys of small shops . Most of the sellers have their own small garages within very large hangar like buildings . There were too many of these buildings to count . In fact there are so many that it is very easy to lose track of where you are if you have n't paid close attention to the steps you 've taken . <h> What About Counterfeit or Grey Market Goods ? <p> Yes , as you have probably heard the Rong Kluea Market is notorious for its large blue shophouses distributing cheap knockoff clothing , shoes , and everything in between . It is advised that you carefully look over any items you want to insure you are n't  buying anything that is being sold illegally .

The smells bombarded our noses while the sights came in quick flashes of color . It was complete sensory overload and we loved every second of it . <p> Rong Kluea Market had many different kinds of seafood to include shrimp , various types of fish , and crab more ways than we could count . One that really caught our eyes was mixed with whole red Thai chilies . <p> The shrimp here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent just passing through we would have loved to take a bag or two home with us .

Seeing things like this is just a reminder that our upcoming trip to Hua Hin is right around the corner . <p> As with most other parts of Thailand , the fruit at Rong Kluea Market was not very hard to find . <p> There were hawkers at every turn chopping open fresh young coconuts and bagging up longan , mangosteen , and rambutan fruit . <p> We did n't  hesitate to get up close and personal with our camera . We snapped away at almost every food stand that we walked past . <p> We had a great time exploring Rong Kluea Market , and highly recommend that you stop by if you have a chance . It can be easy to simply pass through border towns while doing visa runs or heading off to your next country , but we would argue that this market is worth a closer look . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open daily from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM <p> 255 km east of Bangkok <p> Driving time from Bangkok to Rong Kluea Market - is 3 to 5 hours depending on mode of transportation <p> Buses and vans can be arranged from Bangkok at the Mo Chit Terminal , - Ekamai Terminal , Suvarnabhumi Airport , or the Victory monument . Prices range from 200 to 250 baht a ticket . <p> Matt , we went through our pictures and saw no insects from the Rong Kluea Market . In fact , we can only think of two instances where we 've seen edible bugs on a unnamed side street market and at the Saturday Night Walking Street near the Silver Temple eating area . We hop you find what you are looking for and wish we could have been more help . <p> Love your pictures .

This roundup includes a bit of everything : places for singles or families , from free things to do to splurge-worthy activities , as well as lesser known sites- to high-end touristy destinations . Enjoy ! <p> Our adventure began by- flying into Phuket International Airport ( HKT ) . Rather than succumb to high- taxi fares or the questionable safety of a riding a motorbike on Phukets major highways , we rented a car- throughout the length of our trip. - We paid around 1,200 THB per day and it was money well spent . <h> Peaceful Seaside Experiences <h> Go island hopping on an iconic longtail boat <p> One of the coolest things to do in Phuket ( or anywhere in southern Thailand , for that matter ) is island hopping .

These three islands are your classic tropical getaways . They are peaceful , secluded , and have just enough basic needs ( all have at least one restaurant and facilities to use once you 're there ) to make the trip endurable . <p> Starting at 1,000 THB ( roughly 28 USD ) per person , rent a longtail boat from one of the dozens lined up along Rawai Beach , Chalong Pier , or Cape Panwa . Keep in mind that there may be a bit of a language barrier , haggling is required , and tickets ca n't be pre-booked ( at least , as far as we could tell ) . Also , longtail boats are not exactly glamorous ( the engines are loud and the seats are wood ) , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo ops . <p> TIP : Pack a beach bag with your own beach mat or blanket , a big bottle ( or two ) of water , sunscreen , insect repellent , and a cover-up ( sarong , t-shirt ) for the day trip .

If you rather not visit these , there are over 30 other beaches . Many have a comfortable number of restaurants and resorts without being overcrowded , some are working beaches ( used solely by the local fisherman ) , and others are very quiet . <p> The quiet beaches usually have a simple restaurant or two serving up snacks or smoothies and basic bathroom facilities . Some are rocky under the waterline ( they 're better for lounging and building sand castles ) while others have soft sand underfoot and are good for swimming . <p> Good for beach lounging : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for swimming : <p> Ao Sane <p> Banana Beach <p> Freedom Beach ( longtail boat required ) <p> Layan Beach <p> Mai Khao Beach <p> Nui Beach ( 350 THB entrance fee for visitors over 12 years old ) <p> Sai Kaew Beach <p> TIP : - If you 're really looking for peace and quiet , go to these beaches during the middle of the week to avoid the weekend crowds. - <h> Family-Friendly Activities <h> Take the kids to Kamala Beach <p> Contrary to this islands stereotypical images of adult entertainment and crazy nightlife- along its shores , there are fun things to do in Phuket with kids . During our two-week trip , we came across several fantastic family-friendly beaches . Our favorite stretch- was Kamala Beach , which is located halfway down the islands west coast .

You can park at the hotel and then take a short walk to the beach for the best views . <p> TIP : Do n't  forget to check flight schedules before going ( so you do n't  go during a dry spell ) .

The most memorable sunset we had in Phuket was at the waterfront Cape Kata Villa- while- being served a few beers and a home-cooked Thai meal . <h> Delicious Food <h> Savor craft beer and fusion cuisine in Phuket Old Town <p> Yes , do walk around this downtown area and admire the Sino-Portuguese style ( pronounce seeno ) . But better yet , go to Phuket Old Town for the craft beer and fusion Thai food . <p> For us , the main appeal of going to Phuket Old Town was the chance to savor craft beer and fusion cuisine in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to treat yourself to an upscale meal ( whether Thai , Western , or other Asian cuisine ) as well as a glass ( or two or three ) of imported wine and beer . <p> We had a delicious meal at Surf &amp; Turf , enjoyed the ambiance at Prohibition , and had our stout beer cravings satisfied at CRAFTs &amp; Co . The next time we visit , well make sure to give Tu Kab Khao a try . <h> Hand-pick dinner from the Rawai Seafood Market <p> Now this was our kind of seafood experience ! Just east of Rawai Beach near the southern tip of Phuket is a huge seafood market where fishermen sell their days catch . There 's no shortage of fish , crabs , clams , mussels , shrimp , squid , and even a few unfamiliar sea creatures on display . <p> The novelty of the Rawai Seafood Market is that you buy fresh seafood and then take it- across the street to one of the local restaurants where they cook it up for you . The chefs charge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins raw , unprepared weight ) and then grill it , steam it , or smothered in a Thai curry . You cant get fresher seafood than that . <h> Touristy Fun <h> Test your bravery on Bangla Road <p> Personally , we are n't  fans of Phukets seedy red light district . But if you 're curious , you can be thoroughly wowed by the neon lights , elaborately dressed ladyboys , and crazy bar scenes along Bangla Road . Try walking down it if you dare its 100% possible to enjoy the evening without any undesirable side effects . <p> Three tips to make your Bangla Road experience memorable : <p> 1 ) Do n't  go to a Ping Pong show . Its vulgar and you wont be able to forget what you 've seen . Drink prices are shockingly high , too . 2 ) Expect to pay a few hundred baht for a picture with a bedazzled ladyboy . They wo n't do it for free and why should they ? 3 ) Only buy drinks from establishments where the prices are clearly displayed on the menus . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening . <h> Have fun on Patong Beach <p> For as much bad press Patong Beach receives , we had a good experience there . The beach was very clean , we had easy access to unlimited restaurants and bars along the main road , and umbrellas and beach mats were available to rent for only 100 THB a pop . The parking was a bit tight , but that 's the only negative thing we have to say . <p> As for the hawkers , they werent out of control . There 's at least one permanent sign on the beachs entrance that marks where they can and can not go . North of that sign , several hawkers approached us with offers of- jet skiing and parasailing starting at 1,500 THB and 1,200 THB , respectively . Surprisingly , we saw no vendors walking around selling snacks , sarongs , or other beachy trinkets . South of that sign we werent bothered at all. - We appreciated- having both options and were pleasantly surprised that the hawkers did n't  linger and instead quickly bounced to other potential clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patong Beachs main road , keep your eye out for a red building with a yellow sign that says Arabia Restaurant . Just north of this landmark , you 'll find parasailing , jet skiing , and rentable umbrellas and mats . South of this is where you 'll find a beach without hawkers . <h> Fantastic Sights <h> Experience panoramic island views from- an overlook ( or two or three ) <p> Chances are you 've read- about Phromthep Cape during your time researching things to do in Phuket . If you 're interested in something like this , there 's good news : there are a number of equally gorgeous viewpoints ( if not better than Phromthep Cape ) dotted all over the islands bottom half . <p> Karon Viewpoint <p> Khao Khad ( Panwa ) Viewpoint <p> Koh Si Rae Viewpoint <p> Monkey Hill ( Khao To Sae ) Viewpoint <p> Phromthep Cape ( Laem Phromthep ) <p> Radar Hill <p> Rang Hill <p> Windmill ( Wind Turbine ) Viewpoint <p> Some viewpoints are on the highest hills within the island and overlook the town and distant coastline . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the Andaman Sea . <h> Pay respect to several big Buddha statues <p> We cant write a things to do in Phuket list without including one of the islands most popular attractions : the Big Buddha . As in , THE Big Buddha . <p> This huge white statue on Mount Nagakerd is the island 's iconic structure and overshadows a half-dozen other big Buddha statues on the island . Some of them are in pretty spectacular places , too , such as a cave or a hilltop that doubles as a viewpoint . <p> THE Big Buddha <p> Reclining Buddha at Wat Sri Sunthorn <p> Seated Buddha at Wat Khao Rang <p> Reclining Buddha at Wat Si Rea <p> Big Buddha at Koh Gaew Yai <p> Reclining Buddha at Wat Phra Nang Sang <p> That wraps up our favorite things to do and places to go in Phuket at least for now . We were really impressed with the island and cant wait to go back- and experience more activities and visit more sites . <p> If you 're hungry for more beaches , check out Koh Lanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a speedboat ride away from Phuket . If you need help planning your trip around southern Thailand ( or anywhere in Thailand for that matter ) , just ask ! <p> If you 've ever been to Phuket , what was your favorite part of your trip ? Where do you recommend that we go on our next trip there ? - <p> We were grateful guests of several activities during our time on the island . The opinions of all sites , stays , restaurants , and general things we did in Phuket are our own . <p> We have been to Phuket 5 times . Or 6 ? LOL , lost track . We always stay in Rawai , at Palm Village , right across from the Seashell Museum . Or fave spot on the island is this southern tip , with our beloved Nai Harn beach and walks to the Rawai Pier being our nightly cardio . We miss Phuket so much . Maybe time for a return visit . <p> We were pleasantly surprised how nice Phuket is , but we 'd have to increase our budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations will be too hard to resist .

@@59574527 @8574527/ <h> How to Rent a Motorbike in Thailand <p> One of the most exhilarating things about coming to Thailand is the opportunity to rent and ride a- motorbike . Not only it is incredibly affordable , costing as low as 150 baht ( $5 USD ) a day , but its also an excellent way to independently explore town . here 's everything you need to know about how to rent a motorbike in Thailand . <p> The variety of motorbikes available for rent in- Thailand- is fantastic . Weve seen everything from goofy scooters , comfortable cruisers , to powerful motorcycles . And what 's great is that they are inexpensive and incredibly easy to rent . <p> Although we- own our own motorbike in Chiang Mai , we 've had a several- experiences renting a motorbike throughout our Thailand travels . Our first time renting a motorbike was when we first visited Chiang Mai- on our honeymoon over two years ago . Since then weve also rented one in Hua Hin , - Koh Chang , and even on our recent road trip in Laos . <h> What to Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , such as your Thai telephone number or address , or your hotel <p> Most motorcycle companies do n't  ask to see proof of a drivers license , and some do n't  even ask if you 've ever ridden a motorbike before . As long as you can drive away from their shop without toppling over or crashing into something or someone , you 're as free as a bird . <p> Keep in mind , though , that you are driving at your own risk ( and others on the road ) if you do n't  have much experience ! <h> What to Expect from Motorbike Rental Shops <p> Rentals are in 24 hour increments for daily use <p> Discounted rates are given for weekly and monthly rentals . You can expect to pay about 1,000 and 3,000 baht , respectively . <p> Basic helmets are provided ( most often they are visorless and not full-faced ) <p> Sometimes the longest part of the process is picking out which bike you want ! <p> Once youve chosen- a motorbike , all it takes is a few minutes to fill out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of where you are staying in Thailand . The shop will take note of the return date and how much you paid up front . <p> Then you 're handed the keys , a helmet , and are ready to go . <h> What to Expect from Really Good Motorbike Rental Shops <p> In addition to the above list , excellent motorbike rental shops will also provide : <p> Motorbike Insurance : We do n't  recommend driving around without it ! Although some repairs can be cheap , serious damage may not be within your budget . <p> Health Insurance : Health insurance should cover both the driver and passenger(s) . <p> Copy of Passport : In lieu of handing over your passport , some places will only ask for a passport photocopy and/or a cash deposit . <h> Before Zooming Off <p> Inspect the motorbike before getting on . It is wise to take pictures of or take note on the original contract of any existing dings , scratches , or broken bits . This is especially important for newer motorbikes . <p> Hold on to a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and when the drop-off date and time are . <p> Ask were the nearest gas station is and immediately fill up on either gasohol 91 or 95 ( just ask the rental company ) for about 30 baht ( $1 USD ) per liter . <p> TIP : - There is no need to return the motorbike with a full tank of gas . <h> Motorcycle Rental Insurance <p> We highly recommend renting from a company that offers insurance . Look for motorcycle insurance that covers loss or damage and accident insurance if the driver or passenger gets hurt . We do not recommend driving a motorbike without insurance . Ask for this upfront , and if the motorbike rental company does not have it , politely decline and look for another one . <h> Do I have to surrender my passport to rent a motorbike ? <p> It you want to rent a motorbike in Thailand , some rental companies ask- for your passport while others do n't  . We 've noticed that shops located along the main touristy roads seem adamant about handing over your passport . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side streets are more accepting to a passport photocopy or a cash- deposit instead . <p> NOTE : Be aware that no matter what happens , your passport can not be withheld from you . Some rental shops ask for it as leverage if there is damage to the motorbike , or worse , the motorbike is lost or stolen . However , a motorbike rental shop can not legally withhold your passport . <h> Motorcycle Safety <p> Thailand has some pretty staggering motorcycle injury statistics . To prevent yourself from becoming one of those statistics , keep in mind some safe driving practices . But for the bare minimum , <p> Wear your helmet ! The majority of motorcycle deaths can be prevented if drivers and passengers wore helmets . <p> Cover up ! Wear more than just a sleeveless Chang beer t-shirt , cargo shorts , and flip-flops . This does not save you from disfiguring road rash . <p> Take a songthaew or tuk-tuk if you 've been drinking . Do n't  risk wobbling down the road and crashing into something . <h> That 's It ! Now You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be that cheap and easy to rent a motorbike in Thailand ? Its good news- that its- much more laid back , quicker , and definitely cheaper than renting a vehicle back home . <p> The bike shops have two different insurance one is the third party insurance and other insurance will be used for theft , accident to the bike and other purpose .. But its pricey ( 2500 bhat ) .. Is there way I can get this insurance for cheaper price if I plan to rent for short duration ? <p> No Bangkok and Koh Samui are HUGE and we do n't  know where you 're staying . Maybe start by asking your guesthouses front desk staff if they recommend something , or Googling for a shop once you know what part of town you 're in . <p> We do n't  know off the top of our heads . Its probably best to ask the specific rental agency you have your eye on some may say yes and some may say no so we do n't  want to give you the wrong answer . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heading to Bangkok in a few weeks and am thinking of renting a scooter , but I 'll be taking it to Vietnam via Cambodia . Do you envisage any problems with two border crossings on a Thai registered scooter ? Thanks . <p> You 're welcome glad you liked the article . We 've never crossed borders with a vehicle ( scooter or car ) . We 've had friends whove done it on motorbikes but they owned them not rented . Also , will you still have your passport ? A lot of rental companies want to keep your passport , so its important to find a place that wont take yours . GT-rider.com has some good information on the subject . This site specializes in bike rides , so maybe you can find what you need there . Have a great trip ! <p> This was a great read and definitely cleared things up for me . One thing I 'm still not sure of is the vehicle classes . Motorcycles , scooters , and ATVs are all classed differently in Canada . Anyone with a valid drivers license can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an M license to drive a motorcycle . Is there something similar to this in Thailand or do they go by a different system ? <p> Good question . Yes there are different vehicle classes . To legally drive a car in Thailand you need an international car license ( obtained in your home country ) . If you want to drive a motorbike legally , you need to have an international motorcycle license . Although thousands of travelers ignore this and drive around with their hone countrys license ( and to be fair , most rental companies do n't  care what license you have ) , the big trouble happens if you get into an accident and try to file a claim with your insurance company you 'll be denied . <p> Hi guys , great post . Quick question Ive ridden plenty of scooters before , mostly in Central America , but I 've never really thought about this till nowmy Canadian drivers license does n't  cover scooters or mopeds ( apparently very few licenses around the world do , other than the odd European one ) , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the scooter or my health , would then be void . Do you know this to be true ? I figure there 's no point getting insurance from a rental place if it will be void due to lack of license in the Read more + <p> Great question ! You 're right about getting travel insurance through a Canadian company and then it not covering you for a motorbike accident since you do n't  have a motorcycle license back home . ( Travel insurance also does n't  cover damage caused by drunk driving or if you are n't  wearing a helmet when its mandatory , such as in Thailand . ) As far as getting insurance through a Thai rental company ? Well , it costs pennies like , 50 baht per day . Since we do n't  know for sure , that 's something you must ask the rental agency directly ( and get it in writing ! ) Let us know what you find Read more + <p> Hello , great article , thank you ! I 'm in Phuket and will stay for 1 month at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the the law here . Looks like they do n't  permit you drive if you do n't  have a thai dirvers license . Despite that I see many posts about doing it . So , we would need to run into the risk ? And if they get you , how big would be your trouble ? <p> We have n't been to Phuket but we do n't  why the driving rules would be any different there as the rest of Thailand . If you are on a tourist visa with a license in your home country or if you have a in international driver license , you can drive . If you have a Non Immigrant Visa , they want to see an international license or a Thai license since you 're in the country for a long time . If you are caught driving without one , you may pay a *hefty* bribe of a few hundred baht . <p> Thank you for the article ! I 've just been told by a British guesthouse owner in Pai that motorbike insurance they sell at the rental places is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to cover the damages when he had an accident . Do you know if that 's true ? <p> We do n't  know if the motorbike insurance in a scam in Pai . Was there some odd circumstance ( i.e , not wearing a helmet , or driving while intoxicated ) that made the insurance null and void ? Do any other readers know ? Chime in if you do ! <p> " Wear your helmet ! " After witnessing first-hand a serious motorbike crash on Koh Lanta , I cant believe people , especially newbies , ride without one ! The guy riding in front of us drove straight into a parked truckWe can only assume he became overwhelmed with checking around for oncoming traffic and worried about others who were passing him . Good thing he was wearing a helmet because he knocked himself the **** out . Literally , snoring when we rushed to check on him .

It makes us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Thai children riding with their parents and tourists who have little experience riding the roads here .

Do you know whether any documentation other than a passport ( e.g. , a drivers license , motorcycle license , or international drivers permit ) is required to legally ride a scooter in Thailand ? <p> If you have a visa-exempt stamp or a tourist visa , a passport will do . But if you have a long term non-immigrant visa ( business , retirement , education , etc ) you need to show either an unexpired international drivers license ( good for one year ) or a Thai license . Good question ! <p> Hi Guys , I 've rented and ridden motorbikes for months in Thailand and here in Bali . Were so blessed to nail down a cheap , dependable form of transport . As is the case for most riders we had one crash so we got it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the town where were living now . Oil slick . Not a speed issue since I ride like a grand pa lol .

And indeed , we suspect we 've seen a few Thai youngins driving on our back street who are not technically old enough for a license . Weve witness a bit of a change in Chiang Mai Old Citys drivability since moving here two years ago . Some tourists ( and yes , even local Thai ) are absolutely abominable on a motorbike ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 4 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

After stumbling upon a place via Facebook and browsing through the before-and-after photos , we could n't see a more fitting place for a mens haircut than at the modern-classic Chiang Mai barber called The Cutler . <p> A mans first haircut in Thailand is usually cautiously received . Understandably . Images of rusty scissors , dim lighting , and a patchwork job inevitably may turn you off to the idea . Many people- search for the least intimidating-looking place in town before taking a seat . Of course , nervousness and a perceived language barrier prompts you to mime the style you want , complete with elbows flailing and holding up select fingers to indicate the electric razor number . Miming ? Please , stop . <p> Situated a bit south of Wat Phra Singh is a fantastic Chiang Mai barber called The Cutler : Barber and Tattoo . A large awning protects the small glass-enclosed shop from the sun . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber shop but rather a black and white sign written in calligraphy . This is the place you need to go to . <p> Inside sports simple rustic decor . The eggshell white walls are sketched with barber-themed artwork , caged light fixtures hang from the ceiling , and rough concrete is underfoot . Shallow wooden display shelves are home to tin tubs of pomade and hair gel . The walls sport pictures of 1920s-era men with various degrees of facial plumage . <p> The scent of the room is incredible. - Clean and menthol-like , with a faint talc-powder and woodsy scent . Manly . Just like a barber shop should be , right ? Jazz music plays in the background . Theres beer and water for thirsty patrons . Can this get any better ? <p> Amazingly , the 12+12 ft single room is home to three old-time metal barber chairs , with flaking cream-colored paint and refurbished brown leather seats . Two barbers are on the floor , Si and X , sporting waxed mustaches and fedoras . They speak good English and are happy to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binder . <h> The Cut <p> You might be accepted as a walk-in client , but chances are , you 'll need an appointment . Why ? Because haircuts at The Cutler take an hour . Yes , an hour that combines electric shaving , hand-cut trimming , and even precise sculpting with a straight razor . For viewing pleasure , two mirrors are strategically positioned so that patrons can watch their haircut unfold from both the front and the back . <p> Heck , you 'll even get a cool towel on your face and lean back in the chair as they groom your manly beard . <p> After having your hair cut and then properly pomaded into place , you 'll look like a million bucks . And the cost for an hours work by a skilled artist ? A mere 200 baht . That 's less than 7 USD . <p> MAY 2017 UPDATE : Haircuts are 300 baht . A cut and shave is 500 baht . But they are as fine as ever ! <p> In addition to their serviced haircuts , The Cutler sells hair care products including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , you 'll do anything to capture this fresh style they 've created , and you will want , no need , their pomades and gels . <p> So is there any question to where your next hair cut will be ?

A Thai re-entry permit is a convenient ( but necessary ) stamp that allows current Thai visa holders to travel to other countries and come back without forfeiting their current visa . <p> UPDATE : - This post has been updated as of March 2017 . <h> Know Before You Go <p> Here are several important things to keep in mind if you have a Thai visa and plan to travel in and out of the country . Please read the following answers to our FAQs : <h> WHEN YOU NEED A RE-ENTRY PERMIT <p> A re-entry permit should be used only if you have a single entry tourist visa or a single entry- non immigrant visa <p> If you are on a Non Immigrant Retirement Visa , you will need a re-entry permit only- after you have received your one-year extension <p> A re-entry permit is valid throughout the length of your visa extension ( an extension is obtained at an Immigration Office inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy or Consulate outside of Thailand ) ; if you get a new extension ( applicable to single entry visas ) your re-entry permit will be voided and you must apply for a new one <p> A multiple re-entry permit is only cost-effective if you have received a nine-month extension on single entry Non Immigrant Business or a one-year extension on a Non Immigrant Retirement Visa ; otherwise , apply for a single entry re-entry permit as needed <h> WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED A RE-ENTRY PERMIT <p> You do not need a re-entry permit if you have a multiple entry- tourist visa or a multiple entry non immigrant visa ( the exception is a Non Immigrant Retirement Visa that has a one-year extension ) <h> The Benefits of a Thai Re-Entry Permit <p> A re-entry permit allows visitors to leave Thailand for a brief period of time to travel to another country and then re-enter Thailand on the same visa . You neither give up the days remaining on your original Thai visa nor do you have to make arrangements to get a new Thai visa before coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For starters , its helpful for tourists whove been suddenly presented with an amazing opportunity to travel to another country but still want to finish their original time in Thailand . <p> It offers relief for teachers , students , or retirees who have a year-long Thai visa and need or want to leave the country for a vacation or travel experience . <p> Its alsoessential- in cases of emergencies where foreign visitors must leave the country but have every intention of coming back to Thailand . <p> A Thai re-entry permit completely eliminates the hassle of rounding up the correct supporting paperwork for a completely new Thai visa , traveling to a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate , and paying for the application . That itself is priceless ! <h> Thai Re-Entry Permit Application Requirements <p> When deciding whether or not you need a Thai re-entry permit , ask yourself , " Will my trip outside of Thailand go beyond the expiration date of my current Thai visa ? " <p> If your Thai visa expires before you return to Thailand , then you wo n't need a re-entry permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you want to return to Thailand , then you will need to apply for a re-entry permit . <p> To apply for a re-entry permit , you will need : <p> Passport with a valid Thai visa ( you can not get a re-entry permit on a 15- or 30-day visa exempt stamp ) <p> Copies of the photo page , current visa page , and immigration departure card <p> 1,000 baht for a single re-entry permit ; 3,800 baht for a multiple re-entry permit ; cash only <p> If you decide to leave Thailand without first securing a re-entry permit you will subsequently end your visa .

There 's an office in every province . Plan your travel schedule accordingly and give yourself at least a few hours to complete this task . <p> We recommend going at least one day in advance and not on the same day as your international flight . The process should take between 30 minutes and 2 hours depending on- the volume of people at the immigration office . <p> NOTE : - Thai Immigration Offices are open Monday to Friday , 8:00am or 8:30am to 4:30pm . They are closed on weekends and on Thai holidays . Plan accordingly . <h> Apply at an International Airport in Thailand <p> Thailands international airports offer this service. - You can only apply for a re-entry permit at an international airport on the day of your flight . <p> After you 've checked into your flight and gone through the security line ( where security officers check your airline ticket and scan your carry-on luggage ) but before you go through immigration and get stamped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area that you can apply for a- re-entry permit . <p> The re-entry permit desk at an international airport is open every day the airport services an international flight . If you have an international flight departing at 12pm noon , 9pm , or 2am , the office will be open . <p> TIP : Give yourself 10 minutes per person to process a re-entry permit at the airport . For example , if you have three people traveling in your group , show up to the airport 30 minutes early . This should be enough time get a re-entry permit . <h> How to Use a Thai Re-Entry Permit <p> Once your passport has been stamped with the Thai re-entry permit , it is imperative that the immigration officer looks at it when you re-enter Thailand . <p> When its your turn to go through the immigration checkpoint , tell the officer ( politely ) that you have a re-entry permit . Hand them your passport open to the page with your re-entry permit . Even point to the permit . Just make the officer aware that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15- or 30-day visa exempt stamp . <p> If the immigration officer somehow misses your re-entry permit , your Thai visa will be voided . Sadly , you will be- responsible for paying the fees to obtain a new visa or any overstay fees ( 500 baht per day ) . - <p> Each Thai re-entry permit is good for one entry into Thailand . If you plan on making several trips in and out of the country over the course of the same visa extension , we recommend applying for a multiple re-entry permit . This gives you unlimited access in and out of Thailand during the time your visa is valid . <h> When Weve Used a Re-Entry Permit <p> We 've used a re-entry permit several times , the latest being for a Viking River Cruise .

I read the text above and I 'm still confused . I have a non immigrant b visa ( 90 day ) and o need to go to SG to attend a wedding . My work permit is still being processed . Is it possible that I can go out of Thailand without forfeiting my current Visa ( not extended yet ) through the the reentry permit ? or Do i have to wait for my work permit ? <p> As long as you come back to Thailand from Singapore before the 90 days of your Non Immigrant B Visa expires , then YES , you can leave as long as you get a single entry re-entry permit . <p> If you are coming back to Thailand after your Non Immigrant B Visas original 90 days expires , you will have to wait for your work permit in order to do your visa extension and then get a re-entry permit . <p> HI , Could you please let me know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the re-entry permit . I 'm traveling to Thailand in June , I plan to be there around 5 days and then go to Cambodia where I probably stay around 10 days and come back to Thailand . Is there any restrictions regarding the time you can be outside ? <p> When does your visa expire ? From the post , 3rd section 2nd paragraph : " If your Thai visa expires before you return to Thailand , then you wo n't need a re-entry permit . If you still have time left on your visa when you want to return to Thailand , then you will need to apply for a re-entry permit . " There is no restriction regarding the time you can be outside aside from running out your Thai visa . Have a great trip ! <p> Hello !

If you want a re-entry permit at Suvarnabhumi Airport , you need to go through Departures Section 2 because that 's where the re-entry kiosk is ( otherwise you 'll have to go through security twice like I did ) . Secondly , when I got there I had my photos , form filled out , and 1000THB ready . They told me from now on you have to pay 1200 or 1250THB for them to enter the details on computer . This is a new thing at Suvarnabhumi Airport , apparently . Anyway , they did n't  charge me the extra amount and took my form away and returned within 10 Read more + <p> Hello , thanks for the information .

After you go through security for your Bali flight but before you get stamped out of Thailand and go into the terminal there will be a re-entry permit office/kiosk for you to get your stamp . Good luck ! <p> To our understanding , it is not possible to apply for a re-entry permit after you land you can only do it before you take off . That 's because the re-entry permit office is located after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through ) but before you get stamped out of Thailand and permitted to go to your departure gate .

I thought it was however I am in hospital atm and when explaining to the international people about my travel plans she seemed super confused . <p> You have two options : 1 ) Get a re-entry permit ( 1,000 baht ) before you go to Bali so that your current 60 day visa remains valid through Jan 23 ; otherwise , your visa will be canceled . After you return to Thailand on Jan 10th but before your visa expires on Jan 23 , go to an Immigration Office ( one in every province ) and get your 60 day visa extended for another 30 days ( 1,900 baht , 1-2 hrs processing time ) . That will extend your visa until Feb 22nd. 2 ) You can forget about the re-entry permit and fly back into Thailand on Jan 10th Read more + <p> Hi Chris and Angela !

Do you think we have to pay that amount , we are 4 person , so that means 600 euros or we can apply for the permit you are talking about and get also tourist visa at the airport in Bangkok . Thanks and happy holidays ! <p> If we understand correctly , you will fly to Thailand and vacation for a total of two weeks but in the middle you will go to Angkor Wat for 2 days . As a Bulgarian passport holder , you can get a visa on arrival from the airport in Bangkok for 1,000 baht per person and it is valid for 15 days . On the same day as your trip to Angkor Wat ( in the airport , after you 've gone through international security but before you are " stamped out " ) , apply for a single entry re-entry permit , which is another 1,000 baht per person .

I mean is it possible to get re entry permit in other country ? <p> No , its not possible to get a Thai re-entry permit in another country .

@@59574530 @8574530/ <h> Requirements For Thai Tourist Visas <p> We often receive questions from our followers regarding the requirements for Thai tourist visas . This can be confusing for many , so we want to share our experience since making the big move to Thailand . This includes how to apply for a single entry and multiple entry Thai tourist visa ( METV ) . <p> UPDATE : This post has been last updated in March 2016 to reflect the requirements of a single entry tourist visa and the new multiple entry tourist visa ( METV ) , which has been issued since 13 November 2015 . <p> A tourist visa is a great way to stay in Thailand for up to 90 days ( on a single entry ) or up to 270 days ( on a multiple entry ) . <h> Requirements for Thai Tourist Visas ( Single Entry ) <p> What are the requirements for Thai tourist visas ? If you 're flying into Thailand and plan to stay for longer than 30 days , or if you 're crossing into Thailand by land and want to stay longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll need a single entry tourist visa . It is required- prior to your arrival in Thailand that you apply for a single entry tourist visa- at a- Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate-General ; it can be in any country . <p> Visa application form ( copies should be available at whatever embassy or consulate you are applying ) <p> Proof of adequate funds ( copy of your bank statement ) in the amount equal to 20,000 THB- for individuals and 40,000 THB- for families- <p> Proof of departure from Thailand- <p> Processing fee ( varies depending on the country of application , approximately equivalent to 40 USD ) <p> You 'll find that some- Royal Thai Embassy and Consulate-Generals have different requirements for tourist visas than others . For example , those in the USA require 40 USD per entry and payment must be by money order and cash is not accepted . On the other hand , Laos accepts cash only and the visa fee is 1,000 THB- per entry . <p> You will usually have you leave your passport with the embassy or consulate- while they process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take more than one business day to process a visa application , so its guaranteed that you will spend at least one night in town . <p> Alternatively , you can mail in your application along with the required documents. - Before you do anything , be sure to check the most up to date requirements for Thai tourist visas as they often change . <h> Requirements for Multiple Entry Tourist Visa ( METV ) <p> Want to stay even longer ? As of 13 November 2015 , Thailand allows visitors longer stays ( up to nine months ) on a METV . This has replaced the now discontinued double and triple entry Thai tourist visas. - Weve written a separate post about the requirements for the new METV because they are far more extensive than the requirements for- a single entry Thai tourist visa . <p> And just a word of warning , you must apply for the METV in your home country or country of residency . This is different from the single entry tourist visa for which ( in most cases ) - you can apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visas <p> A single entry tourist visa can be extended for an extra 30 days ( for a total of 90 day stay in Thailand ) by going to a local immigration office and applying for an extension . Every 60 day entry stamp you receive on a- METV can also be extended by 30 days. - Weve also written an in depth post about our experience extending a tourist visa in Chiang Mai . <p> To apply at any immigration office in Thailand , - you will need : <p> Passport with a valid Thai tourist visa <p> Photocopies of the photo page , current visa page , and immigration departure card <p> The 30 day extension is always tacked on after- the 60th day of your original tourist visa . So whether you apply on the last possible day or a week- prior to your 60 day entry stamp expiring , you will still receive a full 90 days in Thailand ( original 60 days + 30 days extension ) . We recommend arriving at your local immigration office early to make sure you get in the queue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for a visa extension . However , if you received a 30 day or 15 day visa exemption stamp you can still get an extension of 30- days for 1,900 THB . <h> What If You Overstay Your Tourist Visa ? <p> As beautiful as the views are , they will be here waiting for you to return . <p> As per the immigration requirements for Thai tourist visas , every day that you go over your visas validity you must pay 500 THB . The maximum fine is 20,000 THB . It is up to the discretion of the immigration officer that is stamping you out of Thailand to request that you are banned from Thailand if you overstay too long . Typically one day overstaying will not prompt a fine or a ban from Thailand . <p> Good luck with your visa application !

We 've always been curious to hear about peoples experiences coming over on a 30 day exempt stamp and then getting it changed into a non-immigrant O-A visa we keep hearing conflicting stories that yes its possible or no its not . Were sure you 've done your research though . What a great birthday present ! : ) <p> Love your blog so informative !

Once you 've used up the last of your two Thai tourist visa entries plus extensions , its a bit of a challenge to get another triple-entry tourist visa from Thailands neighboring countries . The closest Royal Thai Consular Section that offers triple-entry Thai tourist visas is in Japan ( that we are aware of ) . However , the Thai Consular Section in Vientiane , Laos still gives double-entry tourist visas , so that might be your best bet as far as money and time spent traveling .

My girlfriend if in Thailand now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the uk before she traveled She wishes to stay in Thailand now for longer than 60 days and was wondering if she had to leave the country to get a further 60 days on the next entry or is it possible to simply roll on to the next entry visa without leaving the country She was planning to travel into neighbouring countries before she left but does n't  want todo that Read more + <p> At the 60 day mark she has two options : 1 . ) Do a border run . This means contacting a traveling agency ( or even her hotel might make a suggestion ) that will take you to one of Thailands border crossings ( typically by a van or bus ) , jump over the border into the neighboring country , and then immediately come back into Thailand . This will activate her next entry on her Thai tourist visa . She can do it both to activate the second entry and again after 60 days to activate her third entry .

Thanks very much for taking the time to write it . I have a question though When you apply for a visa you are required to show proof of departure from Thailand . For the single entry tourist visa you said this should be within 60 days of arrival . But what if you are planning to apply for an extension , which would actually give you 90 days . Do you need to book a ticket that you will Read more + <p> If you know you will do the extension , we would book your ticket at the 90 day mark . If the consulate asks about the date , just remind them about the 30 day extension option and that you plan to use it . If you apply for a multiple entry , it is to our understanding and experience that you only have to show one departure ticket , which should correspond to around your first 60 day mark or around 90 day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Hello Chris and Angela , what a nice blog . But I do have a question , I want to get a Tourist visa with 3 entries , I 've been told some Royal Thai Embassy and Consulates only give the Double entries , to wich Embassy or Consulate I have to go to get the 3 entries ? Right now In already in Thailand , I 've heard that Savannakhet Consulate still gives this 3 entries , is that right ? Thanks already <p> We 've regularly heard over the past two years that the Savannakhet Consulate in Vientiane , Laos only gives out double entry tourist visas ( to passport holders of USA and the UK for sure ) . For a triple entry we recommend Osaka , Japan but we recommending calling or emailing them to double check ! <p> Hello , this is really helpful ! I am from the UK and I 've been in Thailand since September . I also have a triple entry tourist visa which runs out on the 20th March , however I am leaving the country to travel on March 7th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meantime my visa will have expired . I 'm returning back to the UK on the 18th of April so when I re-enter Thailand through Malaysia will they just stamp my passport for 30 days or do I need to apply for another visa ? <p> Hi ! Thanks for this detailled article . One question : if you apply for both extension and re-entry permit , are the days you spent abroad " freezed " . For instance , if you 're allowed to stay til the 1st of january but you leave the country 5 days in december , does it mean you can stay til the 5th of january ? Thanks ! Messa <p> Never been asked for proof of funds either but I guess its worth getting it all together since it is technically required . The Vietianne embassy in Laos is pretty relaxed and there are usually not any problems , so this might account for it , others may be more strict . <p> We 've updated the post to clarify the tourist visa fee . Originally we wrote 1200 baht , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Laos its 1000 baht like you said . Its strange that it costs different amounts at different embassies/consulates . We 've never gotten asked for proof of onward travel anytime we 've applied for a visa , but because its listed on the embassies websites , we do n't  want to ever take that chance of not having it ! That 's the last thing we need to be hung up on when making that stressful visa trip . <p> Haha , Thailands rules seem to change by the day , but as of today , if you are doing anything online , it seems that you can be in Thailand on any visa tourist , dependent , education , business , retirement , etc . <p> If you plan to be a teacher or employed by a Thai company , then you have to be on a business visa .

We do n't  know the official number of days , but it has to be less than whatever remaining days on your visa . So if you have been in Thailand for two weeks already on a 60 day tourist visa , you could stay out of the country for about 45 days , which gives you one day to come back before you have to either 1 ) do a border run to activate your next entry or 2 ) leave the country and apply for a new visa .

I have a couple questions , hope you can help : 1 . I 'm planning to travel to Chiang Mai in Dec about 85 days . I do n't  have plan to do any side trip outside Thailand during this trip . I understood that I needed to apply a single entry 60 days tourist visa , and just 2 days before it expired , I will apply for a 30 days extension in the local immigration office for staying in Chiang Mai for the rest Read more + <p> A. anywhere from 1-3 hours . Go to Thai immigration Office at 1pm ( 12pm-1pm they are closed for lunch ) and grab a number . B. Yes . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a proper visa . C. Is it required to be within 60 days ? Just slowly explain your situation and show them your proof of departure . The bottom line is that you are leaving Thailand and already have your ticket , but only after you do one 30 day extension . Be polite , smile , and we think you 'll be ok ! <p> The in/ out visa stamp for land crossing is coming up soon from what I understand . However , if u have a triple entry visa do you think they would let you cross via land with no problems each time we need to leave ? <p> Were not sure . Unfortunately , its the Thai Consulates/Embassies that are approving all of the double and triple-entry tourist visas , but ultimately its the Thai immigration officers at the borders and the airports who have the final say who gets in the country and who is denied .

The once relaxed exit and entry method requires a bit more effort as of this year . <p> Only time will tell if the In/Out stamps branded in passports will actually let re-entering visitors fly in more than once .

We just did it in DC and it took three business days to process . You can definitely fly into Thailand on a 30 day stamp ( no visa ) and then leave the country to apply for a triple-entry tourist visa .

@@59574531 @8574531/ <h> Living As Young Expats in Chiang Mai , Thailand <p> If someone told us three years ago that we would be unconventionally living as young expats in Chiang Mai , Thailand we would have laughed . Not because it would n't have sounded amazing , but because we would have thought it to be absolutely impossible , unachievable , and unwise . But now that we are here , we wanted to share what life is like for us as young expats in Chiang Mai , Thailand . <h> The Benefits of Being Young Expats in Chiang Mai <p> Living life abroad affords us many opportunities and a degree of flexibility that living and working in the US never did . Although when we think back to our lives in America and appreciate the things we used to take for granted , living abroad has also given us freedom to live life the way we want . <h> Travel <p> Although Angela does work full-time as a teacher in Chiang Mai , we both find ourselves with more time and interest in traveling than we ever did back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of vacation a year , and we agree that the traveling options in Southeast Asia are much more affordable than back in the US . <p> We have taken trips to Malaysia , Cambodia , and Laos and have traveled throughout several areas in Thailand without much hesitation . We make an effort to regularly look into new places for future visits when time allows . Traveling is definitely a new lifestyle we 've embraced since becoming expats in Chiang Mai . <h> Eating <p> Food is up there with travel on the list of fulfilling aspects of living as expats in Chiang Mai . Famous for its northern Thai style of cooking we can always count on new and exciting dishes to try every time we venture out on our motorbike . Being that Chiang Mai has such a large international community , we also enjoy a variety of foods around the world . Although they are n't always exactly what youd get in the dishes ' countries of origin , we have been surprised by how many places we find that do our favorites justice . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . On the days that we want to stay in and get some work done it is always nice to be able to walk down the street and pick up a couple of things for a quick dinner . <h> Meeting Other Expats <p> We 've met people from many countries during our time as expats in Chiang Mai , and we 've enjoyed sharing traveling stories , " life before travel " stories , and life goals . There has never been a time in our lives where we 've met such a diverse group of people who share a similar passion . Our favorite thing about meeting other expats and world travelers is learning about the places theyve been to that are off the beaten path , and their favorite travel tips . <h> Fulfilling Personal Goals <p> Blogging takes up much more time than we imagined it would , but we are spending time doing something we like . I spend most of the day working on the blog while Angela is teaching during the day , and then we collaborate on the blogs progress and share ideas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find fulfillment in blogging , which is what often occupies our day . Blogging is challenging because it brings out many different skill sets for any given task and is enjoyable because its become a creative outlet . Its also manifested itself as the reason to travel to places we never thought of visiting before . <p> Life is a lot different living as young expats in Chiang Mai as compared to office workers back in the US. - While some may think of blogging as " work " , our blog has allowed us to establish new personal goals for ourselves and share our experiences with those who would also like to become expats in Chiang Mai . We 've found that helping others find a path in life is a rewarding way to spend our time abroad . <h> The Negatives of Being Young Expats in Chiang Mai <p> Along with the drastic changes that come with moving to another country , we also faced personal challenges and some let downs. - Living as expats in Chiang Mai is amazing , but at the same time it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , and how we fit into it all . <h> Challenges and Adaptation <p> Every new expat or first time long-term traveler is bound to run into a challenges or things that they were not expecting . We have dealt with a range of trivial speed bumps as well as some tougher times . Being expats in Chiang Mai has been a true test of our relationship , patience , financial planning , and ability to cope with substantial change . <p> There have been many times when we have questioned this move , and being completely honest , there have been times where second guessing our decision has come up . <p> Why did we move here ? <p> What are we going to be doing a year from now ? 10 years from now ? <p> These are questions that we think most people in our situation probably ask themselves when times get tough . When we start to feel disconnected , its easy to begin hearing some of the voices of the people who doubted our move in the first place . <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feelings . We chose a life that most people do n't understand and would never consider to be a viable path for themselves . We still do n't fully understand it ourselves , but we know that we are much happier , relaxed , and eager to face these challenges together . <h> Bureaucracy and Being Foreigners <p> We have had several new responsibilities placed on our shoulders now living as expats in Chiang Mai . For starters , we deal with the time-consuming , expensive , and somewhat confusing process of obtaining and maintaining a Thai visa to live in Thailand legally . Not only do we need to set aside the funds for the visa , obtaining the visa , and any extensions , it can be time consuming to travel to cities in countries that we may or may not want to visit simply because we need to go to a Thai Embassy . <p> Trips to the Chiang Mai Immigration Office have also become something that we dread . Arriving at 5:00 am , hours before the doors open , seems to be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the same day . Arrive at 8:00 am and there is a good chance that you will sit in a massive queue only to be told that you will need to come back earlier the next day . <p> There is a communication barrier and we are aware that we are unfamiliar with nuances of the foreign laws . We would feel at a disadvantage if there were to be a situation that involved law enforcement . Weve seen our friends extorted by the police at a traffic stop , and feel as though it is only a matter of time before we will might have a similar run-in . <p> We also grow tired of being targeted as unaware tourists and being quoted inflated prices by tuk-tuk drivers and street vendors . We 've noticed this pick up during high season . With that said , we have become familiar faces in our favorite areas of the city and are always treated like Chiang Mai residents in these places . <h> Chiang Mai Is Not Perfect <p> Angela and I built Chiang Mai up to be perfect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we feel is very common and happens to almost all first-time expats or travelers with a particular place . <p> We spent almost a year thinking about how amazing and exotic everything was going to be as expats in Chiang Mai , and in doing so , we let ourselves down in some respects . We found out that the weather is n't as great as we once thought it was ( rain showers or hot smoggy air for half of the year ) , and some things just are n't  as cheap as we assumed they would be . Together , we 've come to the realization that no place is perfect and anywhere we go will present unique challenges and drawbacks that we may not have considered . <h> Weve Been Told , " What You Are Doing Isnt Normal . " <p> If we were already in our 60s and wanted to become expats in Chiang Mai , Thailand , we think most of our friends and family would think it was awesome . But because we are in our late 20s , becoming expats in Chiang Mai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Angela and I were subtly but regularly encouraged by our families to buy a house together and start raising a family . We understand that most people do this in their 20s , but its not for us. - Weve both agreed that it is best to live life the way we want to and not how others want us to. - We think this is a great motto to live by no matter who you are . <h> Some Expats Are n't  Who We Expected Them to Be <p> We realize that there are many different expats , and that they do not fall into the category of " well-to-do retirees with steady income . " In the expat community , some people thrive , some people are simply content with life , and others end up destroying themselves . We 've briefly met a number of people who have come here to escape a problem they had at home only for it to be far worse once here in Thailand . <h> Are we Happy Living as Expats in Chiang Mai ? <p> We guess the big question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaing Mai ? " Living in Chiang Mai has created an environment in which we are able to see the bigger , clearer picture of our lives before expatriation . <p> Looking back now , we can see that life back home was too easy , which is what we think made us feel unfulfilled . Our former lives did n't require much thought past the upcoming weekend or what we were going to have for dinner. - Although traffic was a pain and sitting through a workday under fluorescent lights for nine hours tested our threshold for torture , beyond that we were coasting through time and missing out on an interesting world outside of our bubbles . <p> There will be days where we are content and happy , but there are days where we are lost about what we are doing halfway around the world . We appreciate the subtleties of daily life here more than we ever did back in the States , and we would n't change our decision if we could . We know adjusting to our new lives will take time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> For those who may consider becoming expats in Chiang Mai , let our ups and downs serve as a reminder that life will be different . Whether your life will change for the better or for the worse has much to do with how you are able to deal with those differences . For us there are some things that we are still getting used to , but ultimately by trading in small comforts and conveniences we feel we 've gained more personal freedom since becoming expats in Chiang Mai . If or when you move to a foreign country , what do you think will be most challenging for you ? <p> Chris and Angela , Greetings from North Carolina , USA !

This covers the expenses of basic Western comforts ( Western food and groceries , comfy furniture , Western kitchen , air conditioned house , etc ) , but you could go a little less ( 600 USD or 700 USD ) if you have a truly Spartan lifestyle or prefer Thai living ( Thai food , wooden furniture , outdoor kitchen , fan house , etc ) 2 ) Affordable health care we self-insure , but we recommend using brokerfish.com to Read more + <p> Great post .

Why not Bangkok which is a big city .

Thanks in advance Michael <p> Glad to hear you are spending a few months in Thailand ! What 's a tight budget ? Whew , this ones a toughie because everyone lives differently and has wildly varying definitions of " needs " and " wants " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd not recommend less than 30,000 baht ( less than $1000 USD ) per month for the two of you . You could go as low as 25,000 baht per month , but your quality of life decreases exponentially as even very basic things start getting cut from your budget .

Im impressed by the amount of honest self-reflection that went in to this .. I think for most people it can take a long time to spot the negatives to their life choices ! Stick it out , though , it sounds like you know and enjoy what you 're doing despite the hassles of visas and whatnot ! <p> Glad you found us ! Living abroad ( or in any new environment , really ) certainly provides an opportunity to learn about yourself . Luckily , we are thankful we have been able to adapt pretty well and have each other for support . We hope that sharing our feelings through our blog many fellow expats can share in those feelings and know they are n't  alone . It also helps better understanding ourselves when sharing something like this .

We are very happy to be able to paint a picture of life in Thailand for you . Like you said , there are challenges everywhere , but Thailand is a pretty easy place to live .

Just wondering how many expats there are in Chang Mai approx ? and how many do you hang out with if any ? Is it like a big community over there who stick together ? <p> Wow , we have n't a clue how many expats are in Chiang Mai ! We know there are many permanent expats as well as people just passing through for a few weeks to a few months at a time . We hang out with a few expats on a regular basis because they live in Chiang Mai like us . The majority of people we end up meeting are world travel bloggers through Facebook or Twitter meetups , but between everyones travel schedule , sometimes its hard to meet up on a regular basis or for more than two or three times before they move to Read more + <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not glamorize your experience and point out the negs as well . Of course there is much positive to celebrate . I would advise anyone going abroad to learn as much of the language as possible . There are so many free tutorials available . Just remember that the most recognizable gesture in any culture is the smile . Keep on truckin guys . <p> We agree we both wish we 'd learned more Thai before coming to Thailand . Its come in very handy when we use the little we know . While its possible to get around in the Old City of Chiang Mai on English , a few kms out and you have to resort to a lot of hang gestures and miming ! We have no reason to sugar coating our experiences . Sharing both the good and bad ultimately helps others make a more informed decision as to whether Thailand is a place they would like to visit or live . We know we would rather Read more + <p> I 'm currently an expat in Japan , teaching English , and the language barrier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with my coworkers and with any other person I come into contact with , but my minimal Japanese and gestures are what I have to work with at the moment .

I 'm learning so much about Japan and its culture , while learning about myself and growing as a person . <p> It must be amazing to meet so many expats in Chang Mai . A great majority of budget travel bloggers live in Thailand and you guys are so lucky to meet up with some of them . Gosh , I wish I could swap . There are no foreigners here in Dongguan ! ! ! ! ! <p> Yes , it is nice for the most part . At the same time our experience does feel a little filtered . We find it so nice to be able to take a trip to smaller less touristy parts of the country when we can . We can switch anytimelet us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime haha : ) <p> I think the language barrier will be the biggest challenge for us . Here , we can read everything around us , everyone speaks English its easy . If I travel to any unfamiliar city in North America , I can read the street signs , read the menu , and 99.9% of the people I meet will speak English so communication is easy .

So here are some excellent yet practical ( ! ) suggestions to make money online while traveling abroad . <p> Although the idea of taking a round the world trip and not working is rather dreamy , many people realize that the short-term benefits outweigh the long-term problems . And so the search for a source of location-independent income begins . <p> Luckily , we live in the internet era , which opens up tons of opportunities to make money online while traveling abroad . In fact , there are many sites dedicated to teaching others how to make money online . Of course the irony is that these sites are making money by teaching you how to make money ! <p> This blogger couple does n't  teach people how to make money online , which is either good or bad depending on what you are looking for when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , is give you some several very practical ways to fund your overseas adventure and open the doors for a location-independent lifestyle . <h> 01 ( Part-Time ) Location Independent Work with Your Current Employer <p> You may just have the right kind of behind-the-scenes number-crunching computer-dependent job that can be done anywhere and anytime . It never hurts to ask your current employer about online work opportunities . You may be pleasantly surprised to receive a reduced workload that allows you to travel and pays the bills . <h> 02 Day Trading <p> Good with numbers and have a knack for investments ? Earning interest on stock market investments is a popular way to make money online while traveling around the world . We know several people who earn their money this way . The best part is , day trading does n't  have to be a full-time thing . You dabble in it when your returns get low and leave it on the back burner the rest of the time . <h> 03 Copywriting or Freelance Writing <p> English material is in high demand from companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and airlines are just a few businesses looking to advertise to their English-speaking clients . Creating copy for pamphlets , posters , email blasts , and brochures are all excellent examples of copywriting. <h> 04 Stock Photography <p> Love taking pictures ? Submitting photos to stock photo companies , such as Shutterstock and iStock , can ultimately turn into an decent form of passive income . Learn what they are looking for in terms of subject and composition and build your online portfolio . Over time , watch as the cash steadily flows in. <h> 05 eCommerce Goods <p> This ones huge : sell goods online . Use sites like Etsy and CustomMade , which already draw in tons of customers , to sell your handmade creations or unique finds without managing a physical shop . Or customize your own online storefront with Shopify . <p> You can also sell products without making or handling them yourself . Instead , suppliers will make , store , and even ship items on your behalf while you take care of the marketing and customer service front entirely online . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consulting <p> Sell your coaching or consulting services online . Develop how-to videos or documents and guide people in your field of expertise , such as financial advising or relationship coaching . Or interact with clients in real-time through emails , video chat , or phone calls . Need a place get your ideas noticed ? Check out Udemy. <h> 07 Gambling <p> Some people are skilled in the art of online gambling . As long as you can afford to lose the money you 've put into the pot and are n't  a hot-headed player , you can make a decent wage . Just be careful players are sometimes hacked by other players and the internet connection must be impeccable . However , its still a very popular way to make money online while traveling around different countries . <h> 08 Affiliate Marketing <p> This is a roundabout way of selling goods or services online , but you can earn a commission for simply being the middleman and directing a buyer to a targeted good or service online . We know people who make great money doing this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thorough understanding of SEO and the current Google algorithm . <h> 09 Social Media Manager <p> Companies recognize the importance of connecting with travelers through social media platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . So if English is n't the first language in whatever country you are traveling in , apply to be a companys social media manager to better connect with English-speaking customers . <h> 10 Renting Out Your House <p> Own a house ? Why go through the hassle of selling all of your belongings and trying to put your house on the market , too ? Keep the house , rent it out , and pocket the income . There are companies for hire that will collect rent , conduct cleanings between tenants , and even take care of maintenance issues while you are overseas . It may be well worth the cash flowing into your pocket ! <h> 11 Language Teacher <p> Put your talents to good use and become a location-independent language teacher through Verbling . And it does n't  have to be teaching English ! For $20 to $30 USD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can secure a handful of regular clients . <h> 12 Translator <p> Do not underestimate the power of being bilingual or multilingual . Depending on your areas of expertise and vocabulary , you could translate documents for companies who sell products or services in other languages . While the material may not be incredibly exciting , you are still working on your own time and from any place in the world . <h> 13 Website Designer <p> Like graphics and coding ? Help others set up their online businesses while you run your own location-independent business . Its practically expected that every business has a website now , so take advantage of this demand and craft up some awesome webpage designs . <h> Its Definitely Possible to Make Money Online While Traveling <p> Keep in mind that it may take a few attempts to figure out which money making strategy suits you best . <p> And that there is a learning curve . <p> And that it will take time to establish your online presence and get the money flowing . <p> But the point is , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and allows you to be your own boss , which is pretty awesome if you ask us . And considering its much less expensive to live in Thailand than in other Western countries , you do n't  have to feel pressured to match your current salary . <p> So there 's the scoop ! Do these online money making options seem realistic or far-fetched ? Can you see yourself investing time into one of these methods if it means breaking free from the traditional nine to five office life ? <p> Reading this makes me feel like I should do it right now Unfortunately life does n't  work that way but I 'll work towards it anyway = ) Thanks for the tips , I 'll definitely keep them in mind for when I 'm going to change corperate life for life on the road . <p> We say start right now !

@@59574535 @8574535/ <h> How to Extend a Thai Tourist Visa in Chiang Mai <p> If you plan to stay in Thailand for a while , chances are you 'll become quite familiar with your local immigration office . Of the many services offered there , getting an- infamous visa extension is one of them . In this post , we touch on everything you need to know about where and how to extend- a Thai tourist visa in Chiang Mai . That is , to extend your visa for an additional 30 days if you happen to be staying or traveling in Chiang Mai Province . <p> LOCATION UPDATE : The Chiang Mai Immigration Office near the Chiang Mai International Airport no longer is tasked with extending Thai tourist visas . The new location for this service is at the Promenada Mall . <h> A Note About Thai Tourist Visas <p> A single-entry Thai tourist visa conveniently provides visitors- 60 days in Thailand . And to be crystal clear ( and to help you with future travel arrangements ) the first day you arrive in Thailand and the last day in Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days can be then extended for 30 extra days for a total of 90 days inside Thailand before having to leave the country . Keep in mind though that- this entry can only be extended once. - <p> NOTE : - As of 13 November 2015 , Royal Thai Embassies and Consulate-Generals no longer issue double or triple entry Thai tourist visas . Every entry on the new Multiple Entry Tourist Visa ( METV ) is eligible for one 30 day extension . <p> You can apply for a Thai tourist visa extension up until the day it expires . However , you can not extend your visa once an entry has expired , so be mindful of the date . <p> To be safe , we recommend giving yourself a few days before your entry expires to apply for an extension . That way , if your expiration date unexpectedly lands on a weekend or a Thai holiday ( during which the offices are closed ) , you wont be SOL . Its been known to happen ! <p> Applying a day or two in advance also gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the application process . Weve heard tales of people trying to apply only to be turned away because there were- too many people in the queue or because the officer handling extensions was not there that day . <p> TIP : - You can also apply for a 30 day extension on a visa-exempt stamp . It costs the same and has the same requirements as- listed below . <h> What to Bring for a Thai Tourist Visa Extension <p> To apply for an extension , make sure to apply in person and bring the following to the- local immigration office : <p> Application for Extension of Temporary Stay in the Kingdom- ( form TM.7 ) <p> One 4cm x 6cm passport photo <p> An application fee of 1,900 baht ( roughly equal to 60 USD ) <p> Make sure you copy- down your current address and your Thai phone number ( if you have one ) as this information is needed to fill out the TM.7 application form . <p> The TM.7 forms are available at- the immigration office , so its not necessary that you print one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also bring a black or blue pen just in case the office has run out ! <p> NOTE : - No matter when you apply for a Thai tourist visa extension , the 30 days are tacked on to- the day after- the last ( 60th ) day of your entry . Whether you apply for an extension one week before- your visa entry expires or on the last possible day , you will still receive a full 90 days ( 60 days for original entry + 30 days for extension ) in Thailand . <h> Where to Extend a Thai Tourist Visa in Chiang Mai <p> The Chiang Mai Immigration Office next to the Chiang Mai International Airport no longer issues extensions for Thai tourists visa as of July 2015 . <p> Visitors can extend a Thai tourist visa in- Chiang Mai at the immigration office at the Promenada Mall. - It labeled as a- " One Stop Service " and its- open from- 8:30am to 4:30pm , Monday through Friday excluding Saturday , Sunday , and Thai holidays . <p> The office is- located roughly 10 minutes drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching the Promenada Mall on east-bound Route 1141 , the Immigration Office is best accessible through Entrance 2 of the mall . After turning into Entrance 2 , directly ahead of you will be a large red Tom N Toms Coffee shop sign . The new Chiang Mai Immigration Office is located directly below that . <p> Unfortunately , if you take your own vehicle , you will be forced to loop around the building and park in the ground level garage on the other side of the mall before having to walk to the immigration office , which is on the ground floor of Building A. <p> If you are taking public transportation , simply say " Promenada " to a songthaew , taxi , or tuk-tuk driver and they should- drop you off in the front of the mall . <h> Passport Photo and Photocopy Services <p> If you need photocopies of your passport and/or a photograph of yourself , these services are available from a small shop a few doors left of the main Chiang Mai Immigration Office " One Stop Service " Center at the Promenada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTO &amp; COPY . <p> Photocopies cost 2 baht per copy . Six passport photos cost 200 baht . Although the office will not issue only one photo , hold on to the remaining five photos because they will be useful for future visa extensions or applications for- re-entry permits or residence certificates . <p> The bathroom facilities are also quite nice . They are a little ways down- from the immigration office but they are- clearly marked with signs . They are amply stocked with toilet paper and hand soap . <p> Then of course , there 's the mall for you to explore if you need to kill some time . <h> Tourist Visa Extension Application Process <p> Once you 've arrived at the Chiang Mai Immigration Office , go to the Information Desk outside the glass-enclosed office and grab a TM.7 form . Sit at any of the dozen outdoor tables and fill out the form . If you need to , nows the time to get photocopies of your passport or a passport photo from the PHOTO &amp; COPY shop nearby . <p> With passport , completed application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , go back to the Information Desk and hand everything over to the representative . They will clip the documents- together along with a queue number . <p> On a slow day , the immigration worker may take your packet inside the building to Thai tourist visa extension desk themselves . Otherwise , walk inside with your packet and hand it to the officer at the center desk with the " Tourist Visa Extension " sign above it . <p> Relax in a chair and enjoy some air conditioning . Listen for your name to be called over the announcing speaker . Presently , there is no digital number- screen to refer to your queue number . <p> Go up to the center desk and have your photo taken . Sit back down . At this point , you will only have to wait another few minutes for your name to be called for a- second time . This is when an immigration officer will return a- receipt of payment , any change , and your passport with an extension ink stamp inside . Double check that you received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! <p> Now that the services are distributed between the two offices ( the old office near the airport still caters to holders of Non Immigrant O , ED , and B Visas ) , there is no need to arrive at 5am or 6am to get a good- spot in line to extend your Thai tourist visa in Chiang Mai . <p> During one- visit to the Chiang Mai Immigration at the Promenada Mall , there were hardly any people there . We arrived in the afternoon around 2pm and saw- only two applicants and it took us around 30 minutes to extend a Thai tourist visa- in Chiang Mai. - On another visit there there many people and it took around two hours . <p> What 's your experience extending your tourist visa at the Chiang Mai Immigration Office at the Promenada Mall ? How much better ( or worse ) was it than other locations ? <p> Here is a question . Let 's say I have a 180 day tourist visa that says " enter by November 22 . " And I am on the third entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp on that expires on December 22 . Which one takes precedence ? The date on the original visa or the date on the entry stamp ? <p> Thanks so much for your detailed and informative description and the posts . I could extend my 30 days visa which I got at the airport immigration for another 30 days . Without your posts I would havent known that this is possible . I arrived today at 1pm and left on 5:45pm . Today the network was slow at the immigration ( which could happen sometimes after weekend ) and the immigration officers informed about that and asked for understanding and asked those who did n't  need the extension urgently to come the next or at another day . I highly appreciate that the immigration staff was Read more + <p> Spot on information . I was there recently and the dress code is information worth following .

We hope may be able to help others out : ) https : //youtu.be/HwG0p-g6zCg <p> Hi guys . love reading and learning so much from your experiences . Moving to CM has me feeling overwhelmed just with paperwork more than anything else . Coming on a 30 day visa on arrival tourist visa which I will get a 30 day extension on before making a border holiday run . Hopefully on time my retirement visa comes together and I settle in . Keep up the excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful . Went today around 9am to extend 30 day ( the tourist exempt visa ) . When I arrived , I was shocked about the long waiting lines outside of the office ( about 20-50 Meters ) . <p> However , everything ran smooth as written above . I was in and out within 1 hour . <p> Hi , I read just now about here in this page , about the immigration office enforcing the reported address . I had no idea about this . I arrived in Thailand in end of November , and have been borrowing a thai friends condo in Chiang Mai . But on the arrival card I entered their Mae Rim address , becuse I did n't  know the condos address . I have not reported the changed address , and my thai friend has not sent in any paper whatsoever about having an alien staying at their place ( neigher their house in Mae Rim nor their condo in Chiang Mai ) . Will Read more + <p> You probably have nothing to worry about . We were there just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have n't even heard a single specific case where this happened at the Chiang Mai Immigration Office just that it happened " somewhere " . We think you 'll be fine : ) <p> Very useful information , do you know what 's up in this start of the year about tourist visa 30 days extension ? are there so many people ? my mother needs to extend her visa before Jan. 11 next Monday Thanks ! ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela ! I have been digging around your blog for a bit now and am incredibly impressed and thankful for the plethora of information you have provided everyone in the digital world with . I am wondering , can you apply for an extension on a Visa Exempt stamp ? <p> HI , I have a VOA and extended it for 30 days in Hua Hin . I need anothe 30 day extension . Other then flying out of Thailand and returning the same day and getting another VOA stamp , what other options are their ? Thanks ! <p> Rather than fly , you can go the cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ranong ) . You should be able to book a ticket through a travel agent in Hua Hin . There is no option to do a second extension ; only one is allowed . Good luck ! <p> Thanks for a fairly comprehensive list and set of procedures . But please amend the section above in which you say the whole process should take only 30 minutes . We spent literally the entire day at immigration today , waiting in line over 2 hours just to get a number ( which we were lucky to get right at noon ) , then waiting till nearly 4:00 p.m to be called up to have the photo taken and then the passport returned all stamped . Lots of people were complaining that they read online it would only take 30 minutes . I 'm sure there are good days Read more + <p> Some days , like Mondays and Fridays , are very busy and have much longer waiting times . Same goes with just before or after a Thai holiday . We shared our experience extending a tourist visa ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp ) at Promenada so there may be different waiting times for different visas . We continually hear that mornings are very busy , which is why we went in the afternoon in the middle of the week and suggest other people to do the same . <p> Hey , this was really useful for me as I was dreading going to the visa office but I went and did it this morning . Got there around 8.45 and there was already a hug queue , got out around 11.30 . A good note for anyone who is going to the visa office from now until the 3rd of January , there 's a free shuttle service currently running for christmas by the promenada mall . It does n't  start till 11.30 so if you 're going early its no use but I used it to get back today . Theres 2 routes , 1 starts at the promenada Read more + <p> The issue is not what you are trying to do at the immigration office . The issue is that there is a law that says you need to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your arrival card . Its not a new law , but it has n't  been enforced in the past . Now that the system is computerised they are able to enforce it if they want to , and issue fines for failure to comply . If you are staying in a hotel or guesthouse you do n't  need to worry the hotel will submit an online TM30 Read more + <p> Hey gigs , thanks a lot for this useful post ! Another quest for . About the 30-day visa issued on arrival at the airport : if I want to extend my stay with this kind of visa , would I also need to bring the TM28 30 forms ? Thanks a lot ! <p> They would know that no TM30 for that address had been submitted . Guesthouses and hotels do them online . If you check into a guesthouse they will submit an online TM30 which will match up with the address you put on your visa extension application and everybody should be happy . Alternatively you could ask your hosts to do a paper TM30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you submit a TM28 ) a receipt for the TM28 goes in your passport so again , it will all match up . But when my landlady went to do the TM30 yesterday Read more + <p> And if I use my friends address how would they know it is not a guesthouse ? Would it be because it is not on their computer database ? I have never heard of this TM30 until i read about it online . No mention of it when i got my visa or when i go through immigrations passport control at the borders and airport . <p> Both you and your host COULD be fined it seems that things are now getting more computerised and joined up . If you are in a hotel it seems its not an issue the hotel does the TM30 online and the guest is n't expected to report . It appears its when you rent or stay with friends that they are getting picky sometimes . Depends what mood they 're in I think ! You could consider checking into a guesthouse a couple of days before you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For starters you can find the TM.28 and TM.30 forms on this immigration bureau page . The consensus is that the rule ( generally speaking , you and your hotel manager/landlord must report to police station within 24 hours of your arrival , every time you change location , including when you first come to Thailand ) is n't regularly enforced , so when it is people get really confused and upset . <p> Hi guys , A word of thanks for making this helpful page about visa extension in Chiang Mai . We followed your advice and had one of the most pleasant visa renewal trips in any country , ever kudos also to the Thai immigration authorities for making it a good experience ! For reference , were from the UK and renewed our visas about the middle of November 2015 , in advance of when they actually ran out in end-Nov . Special mention of what makes the exercise easier there is a photography shop for taking the required 4cm x 6cm photos with a blue Read more + <p> Although the Promenada mall is farther for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we like that there are clean restrooms , several good coffee shops nearby , and shopping to pass the time . Yes , and the photograph and copy room right there is super convenient , too . Glad to hear you had a smooth extension ! Too bad that this new location will have a steep drop in extensions now that the new METV is in effect . <p> We went today , a Monday at 8:15 . We paid 100 baht for a songthaw from the old city ( Chiang Mai gate ) . There are four signs with the different services they offer ( apart from tourist visa extension there is 90 day reporting etc. ) which all had a line of about 35 persons behind them . The one for tourist visa extension is closest to the building . A little bit chaotic which led to some queue jumping ( mostly by Chinese ) . The information desks hands out TM7 , just go there and get one , do not queue for it , and that 's where the line for Read more + <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting requirements when people apply for tourist visa extensions ( or do 90 day reports ) . So if you rent an apartment make sure your landlord does the TM30 and you submit a TM28 ( supposed to be within 24 hours ! ) , or you could be fined up to 2000 baht when you apply for your visa extension ! <p> Hey guys do u know which form i would need to print out if i were to get it before i arrive at the chang mai visa office . i know they do the form there but i imagine its gon na be busy with the holidays overbthe weekend and monday and i 'd like to have it done before i get there .. so an extension on the w30 visa i got at the airport for 30 days which form do i need to print out .

Please plan accordingly as you can only extend it if an Immigration Office is open , which are Mondays through Fridays . Offices are closed on weekends and all Thai holidays . <p> Yes . Be careful though , some visas such as a tourist visa can not be renewed . You can either extend an entry on your tourist visa entry or apply for a new one completely . Its hard to give the correct answer without knowing which visa you are on . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all the letters trying to find relevant information for my wife and I , but am finding it difficult . We have tickets that give us 98 days after arrival in Bangkok . We were planning on spending 60 days in Thailand and then going to Cambodia for 30 days and then returning to thailand for our final days and then flying out from Bangkok back to Europe again . Any ideas about how to make this work ? ? Hope to buy you guys a drink in Chiang Mai ! Read more + <p> When you come back into Thailand for a second time ( after your time in Cambodia ) , get the free visa exempt stamp . Depending what country you are from , you can either get 90 , 30 , or 15 days upon arrival which will hold you over until to fly back to Europe . They give this type of stamp automatically at the immigration checkpoint after you 've flown in unless you have an official visa . Have a great trip ! <p> Hi I am super confused .. despite your incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa . I have to enter before the 9th feb no probs as my flight arrives on the 30th November . I will definately want to extend my stay in thailand . How does this work with having the 2 entry type ? If I extend by 30 days then leave the country after that ( so 90 days from first entering ) will the 2nd entry still be valid ? Also for how long ? Any info would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks Abi <p> You are allowed to extend each entry one time , so in the case for a double entry visa you can apply for one 30 day extension before your first entry expires and then for another 30 day extension after you 've activated your second entry . In both instances you must apply for an extension before the entry expires ( at the 60 day mark ) . If you choose to extend your first entry , your second entry is still valid as long as you enter Thailand before your " Enter Before " date of Feb 9th . Then you activate your second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do have a question regarding when the extension becomes active . You mentioned how with a tourist visa the 30 days are tacked on the the day after the 60 days . I have a 30 day voa . Does it work the same way or are there different rules when it comes to voas ? <p> If you have a Visa on Arrival ( applicable to these 19 countries ) , then you are also currently eligible for a 30 day extension for 1,900 baht . The same list of required documents is needed to apply . Hope this helps ! <p> Hey thanks for the response . I 'm aware I can get an extension but my question is more based around whether or not the additional 30 days is tacked the day after the initial 30 days like it would be with a tourist visa , or if there is a different stipulation with voas . Any help or insight is appreciated . Thanks ! <p> Hey guys , thanks for putting together such a comprehensive piece ! I 'm just on my way to get an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I came in on a 30-day exempt stamp , will I need to show proof of exit in order to get an extension ( ie do I need to book a flight out ) ? I was originally planning to book one in advance and thought maybe it might be premature if I do n't  have an extension yet . Realize this is really short notice but if you could confirm that would be awesome ! <p> Chris and Angela , Glad to hear you do n't  have to show up so early anymore . I still daydream about living over in CM , but I was hearing horror stories of having to show up in the middle of the night and possibly still not getting in the same day . Just a couple quick questions : 1 . I hear that there 's a requirement for 90-day reporting of your address . Does that apply to those living there on tourist visas ? 2 . Jumping through visa hoops is definitely one thing that keeps me from thinking about heading over there . Is the bureaucracy really that Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting only applies to Non Immigrant Visas . If you are on a tourist visa , you must leave Thailand after a certain amount of time , that being a maximum of 90 days . Therefore , even if you reach the 90 day mark of your tourist visa , you should be leaving Thailand that day . No need for reporting . When you come back into Thailand , it " resets the clock " back to 0 days . 2 ) Theres a trade off we no longer have to get emissions tests for our cars , buy mandatory parking permits , file state taxes , file insurance Read more + <p> This post reminded me that I should really extend my visa while I 'm here in Chiang Mai ! I went today and it was suuuuuuuch an easy experience , especially as after reading this I understood what was going on . Thank you for this post ! <p> All good and all correct except for the misconception about extending a Visa . I do n't  want to be pedantic ( but will ) because so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ) . You can not extend a Visa period . What you can extend is your permission to stay . What you can do is re-new a Visa that is a whole different matter and a lot more complex .

Let 's say I have a multiple entry Visa that expires in November , Read more + <p> The big sign at the immigration office says " visa extension " but the TM.7 form says " extension of stay . " Its confusing when the immigration office calls it two different things . But let 's agree to disagree even Google likes " visa extension " better : ) <p> What about when the tourist visa switches to 6 months in November , assuming that goes as planned . Any word on that yet ? Just curious because I have relatives that want to visit me and stay awhile where I now live in BKK . <p> Were waiting on word for that , too . We just saw this article but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa will be eligible for an an extension after the 60 day mark ( rather than having to do a border run ) or how many days the extension will be .

@@59574539 @8574539/ <h> How to Deal with Chiang Mais Smoky Season <p> The time of year infamously known as Chiang Mais smoky season has arrived . Perhaps one of travelers biggest worries is planning a trip to northern Thailand and not knowing how bad the air quality is. - After living through several- of Chiang Mais smoky seasons , here 's what you can generally expect- during- the worst of it and how to handle it . <p> UPDATE : This post has been updated as of March 2017 . <p> Chiang Mais- hot smoky season does n't  get into full swing until March . However , we 've noticed the beginnings of- haziness as early as January and extending through the middle of May . March and April are the worst ! <h> What Causes Chiang Mais Smoky Season ? <p> The smoky season is caused by several different factors , although we cant say for certain which is the biggest contributor . <p> Farmers burn- fields and brush- to get ready for a new season of crops . Weve driven past farmland just outside Chiang Mais Old City and smoke trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen smoke wafting up- from the hills and nearby mountains . Locals also burn their trash , but that is arguably a year-round thing . <p> Additionally , its hard to miss the dark gray smog spewing from vehicles exhaust pipes , particularly from Chiang Mais- songthaews and tuk tuks. - When the- high season rolls around between October and February , the increased traffic adds to the air pollution . <p> Chiang Mai is also surrounded by Doi Suthep , Doi Saket , Doi Inthanon , and Doi Khun Tan . These mountains create a valley- that traps the dense vehicle smog and crop-burning smoke over Chiang Mai . <p> And not to be forgotten , the last rainstorm passes- through Chiang Mai near the end of October . No frequent rain to clean the air means that by the time its March , the land and air are dry and dusty . <h> What to Expect During Chiang Mais Smoky Season <p> Where did the mountains go ? <p> Chiang Mais smoky season becomes apparent when its typical robin egg blue skies are replaced by a dingy yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campfire smell in the air . Nearby hills and buildings are difficult to see and often disappear entirely on bad days. - On the worst days the local mountain , Doi Suthep , can not be seen . Even the sun is muted to a glowing orange ball in the sky . <p> The smell of- smoke lingers in the air . We smell it in the- morning when we first step outside or open our windows . When we- go out for the evening or line-dry our laundry , our clothes and hair smell like we 've been around a bonfire . <p> We also notice that many surfaces develop a thin gritty film on them . Often we- can see the dust clouds hanging in the air , which are- created by passing cars and nearby construction . <p> Chiang Mais AQI levels can be viewed in real-time on AQICN.org , although this site- does n't  show seasonal trends or a yearly comparison. - For those who are interested in conveniently monitoring the air quality , there 's also an- app called Air4Thai- that is available for Android and Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hazier it is and the greater- toll it can take on your- lungs . Some people may also experience- sinus trouble . For others , the smog can cause- bronchial inflammation , labored breathing , or an asthma attack . <h> How to Combat Chiang Mais Smoky Season <p> Blue skies and fluffy clouds after Chiang Mais smoky season . <p> Many people are concerned with the adverse health effects caused by the increased air pollution during Chiang Mais smoky season . Luckily , there are a few options to keep you healthy , both indoors and outdoors . <h> 01 Stay Indoors During Peak Hours <p> Staying indoors during the hottest times in the afternoon- will do wonders for most people . Chiang Mais smoky season also coincides with some of the hottest temperatures of the year , - so we find ourselves preferring to go out in the mornings and evenings anyways . We keep our windows shut and turn on the fan if we want air circulation in our house . <h> 02 Wear N95 Grade Masks <p> If the smog is bothersome while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect your lungs and sinuses . Look for masks that specifically advertise a- filter grading of at least- N95 . They should- also- fit- snugly around the nose and mouth with no open gaps on the sides to allow unfiltered- air in . <p> These are not the cheap surgical look-a-like masks that can be purchased- at 7-Elevens , mini Tescos , or FamilyMarts . Thais wear these thin , white masks during the burning season but they are useless . These masks do n't  protect the- lungs from the finer particles . <h> 03 Invest in an Indoor Air Purifier <p> Air conditioning units can filter the air for larger particles such as- lint and hair . However , - investing in a stand-up air filter for your home or apartment can keep your lungs and sinuses happy indoors . These are designed to trap the smaller particles . <p> There are many brands on the market . They can be purchased from major home appliance stores and supercenters such as HomePro , but we- bought an air purifier online in Thailand and its amazing . They are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor air quality . <p> We also use this neti pot and nasal rinse to clean out our sinuses from time to time . We bought ours from a small pharmacy at Chiang Mai Gate and use it when the dust and smoke make- our noses itch . There are different- brands and styles of neti pots , but we prefer the squeezable ones to the ones that work off- gravity alone . <h> 04 Enjoy Time in Southern Thailand <p> Otherwise , you can do what weve planned to do and vacation in the southern beach regions of Thailand . We 've recommended this to others in the past . <h> Our Experience with Chiang Mais Smoky Season- <p> We first arrived in Chiang Mai in March 2013 right as the burning season was kicking into high gear . At the time the sky was hazy and the air smelled like a campfire- but we werent- overly affected by the dry heat or the smoke at the time . We attributed this to being preoccupied with getting settled into our new apartment- and being so excited about moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sporadically in April and a bit more in May that the visibility and air quality improved significantly . <h> The Bottom Line <p> Chiang Mais smoky season can make you physically uncomfortable and youll definitely miss out on the picturesque views . Its no wonder why tourists are hesitant to visit Chiang Mai during the burning season . Or why locals tend to vacation down south during this time . <p> We personally do not recommend visiting northern Thailand in March or April . This is especially true if you have breathing problems triggered by air pollution . However , we think- most people will enjoy their time here for a few days and as long as- they know the limitations of their own body and use caution when outside . After all , were sure almost anyone would be- thrilled to spend time- in Chiang Mai , smoky season or not ! <p> Does someone know where to find the pm2.5 for Chiang Rai ? On the web , not on mobile app . Because the AQI is totally FALSE when the pm2.5 is not taken into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moderate for Chiang Rai , and its NOT .

Regarding Air4Thai , they do n't  list PM2.5 values , and if I 'm not mistaken , those are the most dangerous and therefore most important levels to watch . aqicn.org , which you mention in a comment , *does* list PM2.5 . I 'd suggest mentioning aqicn.org in the body of the article in addition to , or instead of , Air4Thai . <p> Thanks ! Weve linked to aqicn.org using the anchor text real-time in the sentence just before we mention Air4Thai , but well change it so its easier to catch while skimming .

Thank you ! <p> Glad to hear we helped prevent a little misery and you were able to change your travel plans accordingly . We personally use the same mask ( with the high-grade filter ) for the entire smoky season . We 've never checked how many uses it recommends but we also make it a point to hardly go out , so we are n't  logging a lot of hours on our masks . Plus , the smog affects us so in theory we could tell if the filter has stopped working . Its a lifesaver if you have allergies !

The end of March when you are planning to come will have a very high ( 100+ ) AQI . Sorry to be the bearer of bad news . Please invest in a N95 filtered mask when you go outside ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela , thanks for the tips ! I will be in CM for two days in March . One of the days I will be about 90 mins outside the city at an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would you recommend that I book the early morning session and get back inside in the afternoon ? Thank you ! <p> Sadly , yes . March is the worst ! The smoke is bad around the entire northern and Isaan ( northeast ) regions of Thailand and dips down as far as some areas of central Thailand . Booking the early ENS session is a great idea to avoid those peak particulate hours . You may also want to invest in an N95 mask ( buy one from a hardware store before your trip ) to wear if you really want to stay a full day . Have fun ! <p> Hi , Chris and Angela . Thanks for your website and information . My family of five ( h , w , 3 kids ( 12 , 13 , 14 ) are visiting Thailand next April for two weeks . We are spending 3 days in Bangkok , 2 in Siem Reap , and 4 somewhere else ( undecided ) . We were leaning for CM for a 2 or 3 day trek . However , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would you do ? We are most interested in culture , archaeology , and dazzling sites . CM seems to nail the culture component . Krabi seems to nail the dazzling sites . Thanks so much for your time . <p> Hi Doug ! Check out our one-week Chang Mai itineraries we have one dedicated specifically to cultural activities called " Cultural Enthusiast " . Browse through our recommendations and pick a few to do during your 2-3 days here in Chiang Mai . We think you 'll love it ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela . Thanks for your insight on the smokey season in Chiang Mai . I am a college student looking to do a study abroad in Chiang Mai in Spring 2017 , Jan through early May ( basically the entire smokey season ) , and want to know if you think that would be worth it . I am not super sensitive to smoke , but just like anyone I do n't  want to be breathing in tons of unhealthy air . I also do n't  want my experience in Chiang Mai to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on hikes/do general outdoor Read more + <p> Studying abroad in Chiang Mai is a fantastic opportunity ! Is it worth it to come here in the smoky season even if you can handle the smoke ? Well , to put it into perspective , we first moved here in March ( right in the middle of smoky season ) and were so excited about being here that the smog did n't  bother us ( physically it did a little , but it did n't  damper our excitement for the region ) . It was n't until later that we realized how bad it was , even though at the time we really enjoyed ourselves . We do n't  recommend hiking or any other Read more + <p> Can you vacation in Phuket in February ? I have a son with allergies . Is the air quality poor there as well ? Also , what are the chances if he is nut and sesame free I will be able to find food for him to eat ? <p> Generally speaking , southern Thailand does n't  have smog issues like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as allergies to nuts and sesame , you will have to be very careful . Canola oil is typically used for cooking , but a few dishes have nuts and other dishes and desserts have sesame . We recommend that you carry an allergy translation cards ( in Thai ) that clearly state that your son can go into to shock/stop breathing/go to hospital/die . Thai people people sometimes shrug off an allergy as no big deal , but you will have to take extra precaution if its Read more + <p> Overall , do you find it worth it to move to CM despite the smokey season ? I do n't  think I 'll be able to afford to move south 2 months out of the year your opinion is greatly appreciated : ) ( I currently am located in Phuket . ) <p> We actually talked about that in another post . We spent about five weeks out of Chiang Mai this time around in 2016 and that made the smoky season nearly bearable . Every year we tell ourselves that were going to move somewhere for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never happens for one reason or another ( mostly because of our C-A-T ) . The smoky season sucks if you can move here but somehow manage to incorporate several short , cheap trips down south during the time , that 's your best bet . Also , Chiang Mai is waaaayy cheaper than Read more + <p> Thanks for all the good information ! Just wondering , you were saying that they are starting the burning earlier and earlier .. Even in Janwe were thinking of a trip with my two young children in Jan and I do n't  think they would cope well with a smoky environment . Is it likely to be pretty awful in Jan or is it usually reasonable enough for a holiday ? <p> You 're welcome ! You could probably get by with visiting in January with young children , but we cant promise crystal clear skies . We would n't recommend coming in February , though . It was already bad this year ( 2016 ) at that time . Have fun ! <p> We almost did n't  come to Chiang Mai because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we had a few extra days to travel , and we are so glad we did . My husband struggles with severe allergies , and the air-quality has n't  bothered him at all . It is very hazy , in fact yesterday and this morning we could n't even see the giant mountain right outside of the city , some of that haze has cleared up as of this afternoon and we can see it now ( although in no detail ) . I would say if you are in Thailand , Read more + <p> thnx x yr reply . in fact i was already keeping an eye on CM aqi index which has almost always shown moderate values , below 100 , so i assumed it should be safe to come . its difficult to say whether one is sensitive or not to that smoke , one can be allergic to an allergen and not to others . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , thanks a lot for the very useful post . My boyfriend and I are planning to go to Chiang Mai from May 1st to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will it be completely cleared out ? We are not especially sensitive to the air quality but we would like to live an " optimal " experience of Thailand . Do you think it would be preferable that we go to an island instead ? <p> The smog starts clearing up at the end of April and beginning of May . It will not be completely cleared out but there 's a good chance that it will be nearly clear . If you do not have a sensitive respiratory system you will do fine . <p> hi guys thnx x the immensely useful report . can you please tell me what 's the situation now regarding the smoke ? ive some friends in CM who are not affected by the smoke . so i need to have the opinion of people who are more affected . i arrive at BKK the 29th march , then i can travel to CM straight away , or wait in BKK few days , up until the10th april . also , the 13th april is longkran , water festival . i do n't  know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know much , it seems wise to avoid travelling from bkk Read more + <p> If you are sensitive , no time will be good for you to come during your planned schedule between March 29th and April 10th . That 's because the smog does n't  begin clearing out until May , which is after Chiang Mai has received several rain showers . The first rainstorm usually happens in mid April , so that 's after you get here . Double check the real time AQI Levels in Chiang Mai and compare them to a health standard . Wish we had better news for you ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela Were traveling to Thailand in mid-late April ( 15th-26th ) . Well be in Bangkok , then the beaches in Phang Nga bay we are debating whether or not to visit Chiang Mai at the end of April ( 25th/26th/27th ) . Can you advise on when the smoke recedes/clears ? <p> I read somewhere that technically the burning season ends on April 13th , but not sure if that is true ( or how long it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 has been unusual we 've had two rain storms roll through that have cleaned up the air significantly . In the past years we 've been here in Chiang Mai goes about four months without seeing rain ! The smog is worst in March and beginning of April until the first rainstorm of the season ( usually mid April ) . However , the smog usually hangs around for awhile and does n't  clear out completely until May/June when there have been regular rainshowers for several days in a row . The bottom line : if you are overly sensitive to air pollution if you 're Read more + <p> I have just returned from my eighth trip to Chiang Mai . I have my first ever attack of bronchitis . The pollution was very bad throughout February . As my dentist is in Chiang Mai I am relieved to read that the pollution is not yet as bad all year . But steps need to be taken to clean it up <p> We have been surprised with some rain in both February and March , which has made the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its still not great ( we smelled smoke and coughed a bit this morning ) but at least the sky is a little blue and not tinged completely yellow . We hope you feel better soon ! <p> Hey guys , thanks for a great post . We are in Koh Lips right now and thought of going to Chiang Mai for a month from Feb 29th . Do you think it would be better if we go to Vietnam instead and visit Chiang Mai in April ? <p> Hi , thanks for the info . I have a booked to arrive in Chaing mai 12th of March , bad timing I know but what is done is done and its now almost impossible to change this date . I plan to look for an apartment to rent and settle down for a few months . All discomfort aside , would I still be able to find an apartment at this time ? There will still be apartments looking for tenants ? I 'm picturing a ghost town .. Also since I 'm coming in the lowest of low season , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more + <p> Its definitely not a ghost town ! Some apartments may not consider this time of year as low season but others might ; other apartments have a set price year-round . You may find a cheaper price if you rent privately ( directly from a landlord ) this time of year . <p> The seasonal crop burning affect Myanmar and is at its worst from February through April as it is in Northern Thailand . In fact , some people say that the smog in northern Thailand is partially attributed to what the winds bring down from the northern neighboring countries like Laos and Myanmar . This time of year is just bad to travel to those areas unfortunately . <p> Thank you so much for this article . We are visiting Thailand next month ( March 7-23 ) , , I was really looking forward to spending time in Chiang Mai but my husband has severe allergies . We will have to visit another time during the non-smoky season . Thanks again !

I 've already done the islands , but I really want to do the North . : ) Thanks <p> Well , were not weather forecasters : ) but in mid February you can expect to see some yellow haze in the air and if you are sensitive to pollution you will feel side effects ( itchy sinuses , weeziness , etc ) . Do n't  worry though , its not like Beijing ! You will still be able to see Doi Suthep through the haze if you are in Chiang Mai , but its visibility does disappear entirely in March . Any pictures you take will have a whited-out sky rather than blue sky . To be honest , you may not really notice it much once you arrive because of your excitement Read more + <p> I just booked a trip to Chiangmai ( but also plan to spend a few days in Phuket ) for the last week of March . I wish I had researched the smog season more before doing so , but seeing your comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will lessen by the time I 'm visiting , knowing itll be almost April . What do you guys think ? I 'm also going to be staying at the Chai Lai Orchid its sort of in the jungle about an hour from Chiangmai . Wondering if it may be worse or better there. Read more + <p> Sadly , it will most likely still be very smoky at the end of March even though it we can smell smoke already . There 's no chance for the smoke to clear up until after several rain showers , which typically happen in mid April . <p> Mine started being really bad today and now its way worse this evening . Has anyone here been to one of the hospitals in Chiang mai to get medicine to suppress the cough ? I really do n't  like doctors/hospitals so would rather try as much as I can without . <p> I 'm afraid Im going to have to spend the duration in Bangkok . I cant take another season of this . <p> When I flew into Chiang mai from my Xmas holiday I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start burning early and seems they have . Plus , its also an El Nino year which will create its own problems . Leaving Chiang mai is not an option for me . I can exit for weeks at a time but unless the job is no more , Im stuck here for two more years at least . I 'm not looking forward to being housebound same as I was the last burning season . <p> I noticed the campfire smell in the air tonight , and my neighbor who is also american and stayed here 6 yrs , said , " they started already " . He is a young man of 34 , and he told me last yr he missed work and stayed in his bedroom for 2 weeks . He had headaches , burned eyes , and breathing problems . He is planning on ditching this job and moving , I will not be far behind him . It does not matter how many cigs it is equal to , in the end its about quality of life . You cant have quality of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing allergy-like symptoms and we can smell the smoke already , too . Ridiculous its in the air so soon ! We already know other people who ca n't take it and leave . We have plans to get out of town in the month of March , but now it seems so far away <p> Perfect ! Ive been looking for a mask that actually works to protect against pollution during the smokey season here . I walk to and from work everyday and feel my lungs complaining . Going to hunt down an N95 grade mask today . Thanks ! <p> We 've basically stayed indoors since March started . I plan on resurfacing when the rain kicks in ; ) If we had n't  spent $4,600 on Shawns Australian visa this month , I think we just would have bailed and gone south to wait it out and return . Sadly we had to put a truckload of money into his visa application and could n't justify the cost of a holiday on top of it , and paying our rent in Chiang Mai . <p> Good article ( again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haze ( reason why I found myself back on your site today ) . I like your idea about using a neti pot to clear out sinuses and will start today . There is a warning though in Feb this year a young tourist from Oslo died from an amoeba infection garnered by using local tap water to rinse out her nose . Capturing an amoeba up your nose is rare but why take chances ? Also , the idea of any bugs up there hmmmm . <p> The neti pot is great for when we just start to feel the tickle in our sinuses and really helps to prevent full blown infection or sickness . We stick to using boiled or bottled water , although most directions will say to use distilled water . Never from the tap , just in case ! <p> Many really DO appreciate your frank and honest reviews about Thailand as it makes our decisions easier/ between the giant spider/ insects and the smoke and haze ha I am inclined to look closer to home for place to retire to.ie Mexico has many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be low , ocean or mountains , etc .. or Panama etc.so who knows I 'll figure it out more over next 2 years . I would really LOVE Australia wow but cost of living is one of highest . Thanks again for stories about Thailand though Dave <p> You 're welcome . Every country has its pros and cons , and its only fair to list both , right ? Were glad we can help you make an educated decision . Perhaps you wo n't retire in Thailand , but now you know when the best time is to visit ! <p> Just grin and bear it , but fortunately I will take my Thai wife and go back to the great Northwest for April and May and miss some of it . I used to live up by Fang and much worse there as lots of smoke comes from Burma and also flights are cancelled to Mae Hong Son some of the time , at least back in the day when Thai airways flew the 737-400 from CM for 600 BHT RT . <p> Chris and Angela spot on advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't recall , my memory is foggy ( pun intended ) : ) We stay indoors , and sometimes , we wear a mask on the smoggiest days . One day I recall the smoke actually drifting into the streets . It was insane . Like a fog , the smoke descended not 10 to 20 feet above ground level and although it was n't heavy it was still way too thick . We usually do Phuket or Koh Lanta at that time to both take advantage of the high season and to avoid the smog Read more + <p> Weve seen the smog rolling down our street too , but we thought we were imagining things !

@@59574542 @8574542/ <h> Is Thailand Pet Friendly ? <p> We empathize with the pet owners who are faced with the tough decision to bring their pets abroad . But is Thailand pet friendly ? here 's a look into Thailand 's pet culture to help you decided if bringing your pet is the best choice . <p> Oakley is happy living with family in the US. - We do n't  think he is a good fit for Thailand . <p> We made the sobering decision to bring along our tabby cat , MooShu , but left our American Bully , Oakley , behind with family . We later agreed that this was the right decision because of his size and breed . here 's a look at seven major deciding factors that influenced our choice to keep our cat but leave our dog in the US . <h> Veterinarians <p> Thailands medical care is up to par with Western standards for both people and animals . Modern medical pet care is readily available in cities and large towns . While services will vary across facilities , it 's possible to receive 24 hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccinations , and general exams . <p> We had a scare with our cat in the middle of the night a few months after moving to Chiang Mai , and another mishap a year later . But much to our relief , we received immediate medical care from English-speaking doctors . And the cost ? About 10% of what similar procedures cost in the US . Nice ! <h> Street Dogs and Cats <p> After long observing Chiang Mai 's Old City streets , as well as traveling to over a dozen other cities throughout Thailand , one thing is unavoidable : street dogs and cats . They are everywhere , roaming neighborhoods , lounging outside of temples , and skittering through alleys and across dirt roads . <p> We cant say for certain these cats and dogs are homeless . Its evident that Thais throw them scraps of food throughout the day , but they are n't  cared for at the same level as cats and dogs are back in the USA . Many are pretty scrappy looking , complete with matted fur , bad skin conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so baby-rearing females and territorial males are the norm . <p> Strays are often curious about foreign leashed dogs but often mean no harm . In fact , sometimes they show no interest at all . But we would n't go as far as saying that going for a dog walk is relaxing . There are definitely enough strays wandering around and we can never be sure which ones are aggressive . <p> We 've watched a friends miniature Cocker Spaniel several times and have had good experiences taking her out for potty breaks . Shes a calm dog and there 's only been one minor confrontation out of all the times we 've walked her in our neighborhood . One of our neighborhoods aggressive little dogs charged us , but we scooped her up and chased the dog away . <p> We laugh at the thought of trying to do that with our old dog , Oakley , who is 85lbs ! Although he s not aggressive , what could we have done if a stray got too assertive and things started getting nasty ? Ultimately , we recommend taking extra precautions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more confrontational or upfront with others . <h> Dog Parks <p> There are beautiful parks for people to take a stroll , have a picnic , and exercise . While some parks allow leashed dogs for walks , many park are not exclusively dog parks and do not allow dogs to roam free . There are also parks that do not allow dogs at all . <p> It will take some looking to find an area to safely unleash your dog and allow to play . However , Chiang Mai University , located just west of the Old City , hosts a dog friendly park where dogs can run around . <h> Pet Stores <p> Pet food and supplies can be found in major stores , such as Tesco Lotus , Makro , and Big C. There are alsomany boutique pet shops . They typically offer a good variety of cat and dog food , including several familiar brands we 've recognized from the US . <p> There are also plenty of toys , grooming items , and clothing for smaller dog breeds . In fact , there seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little foo-foo dogs ! On the flip side , its hard to find a good variety of big heavy bags of dog food , large collars , and strong chew toys for big dogs . <p> For specialty food for pets on a diet or with allergies , we recommend browsing the selection offered at some veterinarian offices . <h> Boarding and Kennels <p> A huge deciding factor for bringing our big dog was the availability of kennels or dog boarding facilities in Chiang Mai . We had plans to travel , but we could n't just leave our dog alone for two or three days like we can our cat . <p> Before we moved to Thailand in March 2013 , we browsed the internet extensively for kennels in Chiang Mai . We found nothing.Nothing . <p> Even today with our cat , we have to ask our neighbors or friends to watch him while we are gone . It generally works out , but what if we did n't  have that kind of network ? Talk about stress ! <p> Since we 've moved to Chiang Mai , a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chiang Mais Old City called Lucky Dogs . We wish they started advertising online a year sooner ! <h> Transportation <p> Motorcycles are a popular way of getting around Thailand . As tempting as it might be ( especially after watching the locals do it quite often ) , they are not a wise choice to transport a pet . Weve been sickened by the sight and sound of a small dog falling off a motorbike floorboard , yelping as it was dragged by its collar that was still leashed to the handlebars . <p> We planned on riding a motorbike in Thailand , but bringing our big dog would have prompted us to buy a car . In a bind , or for short distances , we might have found a songthaew or tuk-tuk that allowed pets on board . But in the case of longer or more isolated road trips , or even emergencies , we wouldve needed a car . Unfortunately , a car is a much larger investment than a motorbike and an inconvenience in a city like Chiang Mai . <p> Public transportation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train rides with animals , but they are only allowed on third-class trains . No beds , no AC , just hot air blowing in the windows and bench seating . <p> As for flying , Thai Airways once allowed small pets on board if you booked ahead and paid an extra fee . Unfortunately , they have since reduced their service from pets flying in-cabin to flying as checked baggage only . Breed restrictions are also in place and tickets cost a whopping $238 USD compared to an affordable 360 baht ( $12 USD ) when we flew our cat in-cabin back in March 2013 . <h> Hotels and Housing <p> Hotels and guesthouses are a dime a dozen in Thailand , but it takes a bit of searching to find pet friendly hotel . Luckily , our friends have done extensive traveling throughout Thailand with their dog and put together a great list of pet friendly hotels throughout the country . <p> We wish wed had this list when we first moved to Thailand ! When we flew our cat from the US to Thailand , his flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly hotel in Bangkok was fully booked for the next night . We eventually snagged another pet friendly hotel , but only after a stressful search . <p> Be aware that some hotels unintentionally or incorrectly advertise themselves as pet friendly , only to turn you and your pet away . Make sure to always call ahead to avoid an awkward situation . Also , they may include an extra non-refundable pet fee . Always be sure to clean up after your pets , both inside and outside of the hotel room , to make sure hotels will continue providing a pet friendly service . <p> " No Pets Allowed " are not just limited to hotels and guesthouses . While house hunting in Chiang Mai , we learned that condos do n't  allow pets at all and few serviced apartments do , typically upon management approval . Although its not uncommon for pet owners to sneak their cat or dog into the facility , there 's the risk of getting caught . We tried that at our first serviced apartment in Chiang Mai and got kicked out two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned house or townhouse and let the landlord decide on an individual basis . <h> Is Thailand Pet Friendly ? <p> We think Thailand is suitable for small pets that are content with living indoors . However , we understand that many pets are seen as members of the family and owners would do anything to keep their pet healthy , safe , and in a happy home , no matter what country they travel to . <p> We are glad we made the choice to bring our cat and not our big dog . As much as we love and miss Oakley , we know he s happy in a big yard chasing squirrels back in the US with family . Heck , he could n't take Thailands heat anyways ! <p> Hi Chris &amp; Angela My husband and I moved to Pattaya from Australia last month and we brought our 2 y/old oriental cat Max with us . We live in a condo with plenty of room for Max to run around in , and as he has always been an indoor cat he is very happy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel .

And yes , 100% agree to have a Thai friend negotiate the bungalow for a pet friendly stay before arriving . <p> I can recommend to anybody travelling around Thailand ( I live here and am speaking from experience ) to book the Ibis hotel chain . They are advertised as pet friendly and they are . I have had absolutely no problems with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge ( avg 1500 baht ) . Clean modern rooms . I was pleasantly surprised with this find . <p> We have stayed at several Ibis locations in Bangkok and they are pet-friendly , modern and clean . Same as your experience . However , the Ibis location in Chiang Mai is NOT pet-friendly we actually spoke with the manager face to face about it and he assured us it was not . Be sure to double check before you book ! <p> Thanks for taking the time to make such an informative site ! ! I 've just got a job starting in August in Pattaya and I 'll be moving with my dog Tiago from Malawi , Africa ( he s an African dog so he s used to the heat ! ! ) and its great to have a realistic view of what to expect . With a bit of research I 've found that there are many pet hotels that offer a daycare service which will be fantastic for us as I 'll be staying in an apartment for a few weeks until I get a house with a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south away from the Chiang Mai Moat . At the first four-way intersection with a light , turn right . 100m or so on the right are a strip pet stores . It has cages and pet houses outside with a large sign with a cat or dog above it . <p> Its fascinating to get such a full and practical review of pets and small animals in Thailand . : - ) I wondered how the Thai treat dogs and cats , and I 'm not surprised to read that they are friendly to them , even if they do n't  quite have the whole adoption culture of animals . <p> Its definitely a different culture here , but good and bad . The good is seeing that the Thais believe that animals should have the freedom to roam outside , wherever and whenever , and not cooped up all day inside . Westerners see this a bit differently , but Thais still care for them in their own way , providing water and scraps and the occasional bath . <p> We brought our two cats from Dubai in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both cats was around $300 ! I adopted my older cat in 2006 in Korea , and she has since flown cargo to Canada and then a couple years later to Dubai . It cost about $1000 each trip , including all paperwork . Ugh ! Hoping to stick around here a while . Moving with pets is stressful . ; ) <p> Wow , your cat is seeing more of the world than most people ! We ended up paying around $1000 to ship our cat from the US to Thailand . $300 sounds good from Dubai to here . It was the most stressful part of our move too , but were glad we brought him . Sounds like you are too ! <p> We brought our dog with us when we moved to Chiang Mai from Dubai . If we had n't  been able to bring her we would have to have moved somewhere else as we would n't leave her behind ( I realise for you it was different as Oakley has been left with family ) . Mango has thrived in Thailand ! Shes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . We have an excellent vet within walking distance and medical care costs a fraction of what it did before . Of course having a dog curtails our travelling but we 've had housesitters when Read more + <p> We remember Mango ! That 's great to know her behavior got even better , and you 're super lucky to have a vet so close . It cost a lot to get our cat here too ( even more than a one-way ticket for one of us ) but were glad to hear you 've had a great experience . We read your post where you describe your dog being bit twice in three days by soi/temple dogs and are happy to hear that the living arrangements outside of the city center are safer for Mango . She has wonderful parents ! It should be pointed out that another reason Read more + <p> Excellent post , and thanks for the link to pet friendly hotels on 8milesfromhome . I think 1 of the most important consideration has to location , like you pointed out , soi dogs can be a nightmare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to grass land or unpopulated beaches you will have a much more enjoyable dog walking experience . I commend the few people who I see walking their dog on a leash around Pattaya . <p> Climate has to be another consideration , will your pet be happy in the hot and sticky climate . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , Excellent breakdown . I never brought a pet over but spending 18 of months of the past 40 months in Thailand I 'd say you 're spot on . Be aware that although street dogs are all over the place most seem simply curious to interact with folks house pets , and in some cases , they befriend them . I recall a handful of expats who walked their dogs on Nai Harn Beach in Phuket . Theyd roll up and 5 , 10 or 20 of the beach soi dogs would greet them , and all would play . In general , these dogs give no people Read more + <p> Wow , we commend you for rescuing a soi dog ! That takes some courage , especially driving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to carry a stick in their neighborhood when they walk around or want to go for a jog . The guy actually got badly bitten in his calf last month ! The thing is , you just never know with soi dogs ! It was n't a risk we were willing to take with our dog , and we hated the thought of having to deal with potential confrontations on a daily basis .

@@59574543 @8574543/ <h> What Things Are Not Cheap in Thailand ? <p> We love- that Thailand is among the worlds most affordable countries to travel and live in , and it certainly allows us to live comfortably on much less than we did back home . But all things are not cheap in Thailand and many people are lead to believe this ( as we once were ) . Saying so is- both- inaccurate and deceptive . So here 's a look at Thailands more expensive side . <p> Cheap rent ? Yup . Inexpensive food ? You got it . Affordable medical care ? You betcha . There are tons of budget-friendly aspects about Thailand , which makes it- such a popular place to travel to and live in as well as a hot- topic for people to write home- about . <p> Although these three key components to basic healthy living can be very affordable in Thailand , there are- far more to lifes expenses than where you sleep , what you consume on a daily basis , and how you- care for your body . This is what many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why sharing such an incomplete snapshot of their monthly expenses irks the heck out of us. - <p> Time and time again we come across blog posts , videos , or online articles through- popular traveling websites where the author talks- about living in Thailand for just a few hundred dollars a month . In fact , we recently stumbled across an article like this and it had us shaking our heads . Its actually what inspired us to write this post . <p> " My rent is 150 USD per month and I spend 5 USD on food each day . I spend the rest on transportation and treating myself to massages a few times a week . See , I can live in fill in blank with random Thai city for 400 USD per month ! " - End itemized expenditure . <p> We kid you not . <p> You do n't  say ? ! You failed to mention your electricity bill . What about laundry , whether you do it at a coined machine or drop it off at the cleaners ? Bottled water ? Adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ? Youve also failed to mention the cost of grown-up responsibilities such as visa expenses ( the visa itself plus the transportation costs to do a border run ) , a one months security deposit at your new apartment , or the cost of a new bicycle tire or motorbike helmet . <p> Anyhow , too many people believe that Thailand is dirt cheap across the board when its not. - We can not stress enough that things are not- cheap in Thailand all the time . here 's more on were talking about : <h> Electronics <p> Angela lost her iPhone in Bangkok the first day we moved to Thailand . The story had something to do with- a cab driver who could n't find our hotel , having to pee like a racehorse , and leaping from the taxi- without noticing the- soon-to-be orphaned phone in the back seat . <p> Unfortunately , she went awhile without a replacement . That 's because a quick look at an iPhone 4 back in 2013 was about 500 USD . There was no discounted price for signing up for a new cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - In fact , the other day we were looking at the new Samsung Galaxy 6 , and its over 700 USD . Wowzers. - <p> TVs and computers are just as expensive and do n't  even get us started on batteries or memory cards . On a recent equipment overhaul , we realized that extra batteries and memory cards for our new camera cost us nearly twice as much in Thailand as they- did back home ! And the strangest thing was that some of the items were even stamped " Made in Thailand . " <p> As far as smaller single-voltage electronics go , we 've had success finding cheaper versions at the markets or small mom and pop stores . We 've reluctantly purchased an electric razor at Robinson ( a big modern department store ) for nearly 1,500 baht ( 43 USD ) because it was the first one we had seen in weeks after our arrival . Months later we found a better , cheaper model at the bottom floor of a Big C for less than 500 baht ( 14 USD ) . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USD back in the States , so it was n't much of a- bargain . <h> Vehicles <p> Cars are expensive in Thailand and it does n't  help that all the popular models are imported . The cost of a new basic model Honda Civic is 778,000 baht ( 24,698 USD ) while the median income of a Thai citizen- with a bachelor 's degree is 804,950 baht ( 25,554 ) . Unfortunately , the average yearly Thai salary is 267,750 baht- ( 8,500 USD ) . Its easy to see why motorbikes are a popular alternative to cars . It was the case for- us ! <p> Even renting a car in Thailand is nearly ten times more expensive than renting a motorbike . On a short-term contract , you can usually get- a 125cc bike for 150 to 200 baht per day . A car usually goes for around 1,200 to 1,500 baht per day . That 's a price swing of 5.70 USD to 43 USD ! <h> Furniture <p> After signing a lease on a- partially furnished townhouse , we had assumed that if our rent was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surely the furniture would be around that same 25% price point . Wrong . <p> About a dozen stores later , we just could n't swing the money for 21,000 baht ( 600 USD ) couch and the 3,000 baht ( 86 USD ) for each bar stool . That 's more than two months rent ! So we reluctantly stuck with the sparse Thai-styled furniture that came with the townhouse . <h> Alcohol <p> The local beer and liquor are- especially cheap and we shamefully admit drinking them- on a typical night out . Unfortunately , the few local beer brands ( Chang , Singha , and Leo ) are- generally similar ( all light pale lagers ) and the local whiskey rum is pretty rough going down . When we want something different , we pay out our noses . <p> Imported liquor , wine , and beer are actually just as pricey as back home , if not a little more because of import taxes . After awhile , its difficult to justify spending 150 baht on a Thai dinner for two and then turn around and drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just share a bottle set of local Sangsom rum and soda water and mix it ourselves for 200 baht . Or go for- a 100- baht ( 2.85 USD ) 630 mL bottle of Leo instead of a- 200 baht ( 5.70 USD ) 568 mL pint of Guinness . <h> Bottled Products <p> Shampoo , body wash , deodorant , lotion , bug spray , dish soap , bathroom cleanerkeeping yourself and your house clean and smelling good costs just about the same as it did before . Sure , some of the generic or Thai brands are more- affordable and there are selections of cheap but low-quality products . But again , its not as if a bottle of laundry detergent or face lotion costs 20% of what it did back home . <h> Western Food <p> When we first moved to Thailand , we were happy to see that the major cities served- familiar- Western- food . At first we didnt- mind spending 250 baht ( 7 USD ) on a single serve- pizza or 150 baht ( 4.30 USD ) on a burger and fries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But when we got over the novelty and compared it to the- price of Thai food good Thai food and realized we were paying five or six times more for a plate of mediocre spaghetti , it made us think twice how much we were spending . <p> And as far as groceries go , we are thrilled to have several Western grocery stores in Chiang Mai with access to foods like- hummus , beef stock , tortillas , and Greek yogurt . However , the price difference in groceries between what we spend at our local market ( around 300 baht or 8.60 USD ) three times a week and what we spend on our current twice-a-month trip to our favorite international grocery store- ( 4,000 baht or about 115 USD ) is- quite a bit ! <h> Western Clothing <p> If you 're big busted or bellied , long-legged , or have larger than average feet , - you will pay much more for quality clothing and shoes that fit you . That 's because ( at least from our experience ) most of the larger sizes are imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra large sizes do n't  even exist in Thai clothes ! <p> Shorter slimmer people will have luck finding cheap ( yet again , low quality ) clothes in Thai markets for 150 to 300 baht , but it gets old when the hems start unraveling or buttons pop off after a few washes . You get what you pay for , and that 's just the case with good quality Western-sized clothes . So get ready to dish out 1,000+ baht for a new pair of pants , a new dress , or a nice shirt . <h> Visas <p> Visa services , applications , and visa maintenance ( such as extensions or expenses related to border runs ) are all necessary evils and the price of them adds up . In fact , just the other day we applied for extra pages in our passports at the US Consulate and they were a whopping 82 USD per- passport . For some stinkin- paper ! <p> Its easy to overlook this expenditure because it only rears its ugly head once every few months , or if you 're lucky once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your budget . <h> Things Are Not Cheap in Thailand At Least , Not Always <p> We could go on about other things like some traveling expenses , kitchen appliances , or tuition at international schools , but we think you get the point . <p> On the flip side , not everyone who lives in Thailand has to- or wants to- live cheaply . There is still a market for people who are willing to pay more , so it shouldnt come as a surprise to learn that- all- things are not cheap in Thailand . <p> Realistically , a portion of your monthly expenses will go to expensive items , some of which are either sudden necessities- or- emergencies . Do n't  feed into this " live like a king for $500 per month " hogwash- that continues to circulate on the web . If your common sense tells you it sounds too good to live comfortably and happily off a few hundred bucks a month , it probably is . <p> I thought I had read all blogs about Thailand . This one is great . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost monthly . First I would never consider going to the Dr. in California . I only go to Drs in Bangkok and Bangkok Hospital . Most of them have practiced in the USA but hate the insurance system . I am now moving to Thailand permanently and still work so the airport is important to me . My wife is Filipino so she uses the market for veggies and other items which are very inexpensive , However we still use western Read more + <p> Sounds like you and your wife are a lot like us as far as lifestyle taking advantage of the affordable markets and local restaurants but enjoying Western malls and AC from time to time , too . With our blog we aim to show people that its possible to live on below average budget as compared to the USA and still be very comfortable . No need to pinch pennies ! ( and sometimes its unrealistic , as what we address in this particular post ) . Its great to know that after living in eight different countries you like Thailand the best : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into conveniences and modernity. who does n't  like a nice piece of steak or glass of good wine if they can afford be it on daily or occasionally . Heck , plenty of nice reasonable Thai food why bother to eat western . To live western is n't cheap in anywhere in the world . Live like a local and cost will be lower . array of delicious thai food and markets to explore and that 's the fun part about it . That 's usually a challenge for most expats and long term tourist . in develop western countries things and rent Read more + <p> Yes , I think you went straight to the point . Living as a Thai could allow you to live with a very little amount of money ( even less than 400$ a month , rent included ) . I personally think that the perfect way to live in this country , save some money , interact with locals and their habits , ergo getting to know the culture is to try to live as thais live as much as possible and maybe " treat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Only one thing I disagree with this article : Alcohol here is not cheap Read more + <p> A sure way to live on less is to befriend Thais . They show you all the short cuts and deals and how to be comfortable shopping , eating , and living in " Thai " rather than Western way . We agree about the Thai alcohol to Thai cost of living comparison ratio its outrageous ! Thanks for commenting ! <p> In places like Thailand , its incredibly cheap to live the locals , but incredibly expensive to live like Westerners . Import tax is part of the problem ( primarily with respect to alcohol and cars ) , but not the only problem . its fairly common for Thai importers to come to a special arrangement with Thai custom officers to avoid paying any import duties . Typically the importers would falsify the manifest as non-luxury product or understate its actual value by a factor of 100x , and the incentivized Thai Custom officials would look the other way . The real problem is that these importers make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alibaba site and have put it to good use . Yeah , those import taxes hurt a lot and that 's an incentive for us to slowly transition to Thai products to save money . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Hi Angela and Chris I was back packing on my own around Cambodia and Thailand . I 'm 47 years young and I fell in love with the culture and people . While I was in Thailand I even had the privalage to stay at a Buddhist university ! What an experience that was . I have more friends in Thailand now than Australia . I work in aged care and now i 'm studying a TEFL course to move and teach in Thailand . <p> Hey Angela and Chris , If people tell you that living in Thailand is so cheap , then as an alternative , they should come to sunny South Africa . I know that since coming to Thailand almost 10 years ago , prices have gone through the roof , compounded with the fact that the South African currency has taken a major tumble against the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how cheap it is to live in the best part of Cape Town , South Africa . Yes ! I know you 've probably heard about the high crime rate here , but its nothing more than Read more + <p> not to get too off-topic grahame , " the best part of Cape Town " would love to know which suburb ( went to school in saffie , have not been back in 20 years and thinking of a three month sortie early 2016 ) thanks <p> I totally agree with you , my aunt told me that thailand is less expensive when it comes to transportation , food and accomodation.After reading this , i really want to go to thailand right now , . I wish oneday i could go with my family or even friends . <p> For all us large farang out there both male and females , there are several shops that cater for us with the sale of overruns that would have gone to the USA . You will find them at several petrol Stations ( PTT ) and in Robinsons . I have forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isExport 21 . You will find some cheap good quality name brands , but some items may have different college names on them . Still pay 150 bht for an XXL ( UK would be XXXXL ) baseball shirt , or summer shirt you got ta love it ! <p> Export 21 is a good option and has changing rooms , too . ( Its the little things in life ) Weve noticed the clothing stores at the gas station but also cant remember the name , but they had some decent stuff . Definitely well worth a look . <p> Interesting . As they say YMMV . As mentioned in other comments I too have a Thai partner so it helps keep costs down for certain items ( MBK , clothes , market shoppingetc ) . She gets the clothes for cheap and she strengthens/alters them with her awesome sewing skills . Rent is cheap ( 9,000 baht ) and the place I am at is nice ( washing machine in the unit , pool &amp; gym ) . I do n't  need a lot of Western food ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya ) with the exception of an occasional craving and my partner is a great cook so no Read more + <p> JLR Great story ! Thanks for painting a realistic picture of living in Thailand , adopting the Thai way of life , and staying away from ( expensive ) Western habits . Sharing your experience really puts it into perspective on how to live more affordably in Thailand . And its sounds like you have a lovely lady , too ! Were glad to hear life is good o thin this side of the world . <p> Chris and Angela , Thank you for another great post ! Ive been following your blog for some time . Your writing is entertaining and very good reading . I really appreciate your honesty and having numbers to illustrate . The claims to " live like a king for $500 a month " really is misleading . Keep up the good work and hope you continue to enjoy life in paradise . <p> Thailand is cheap and it is n't cheap if that makes sense . Western food certainly falls in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy some half decent Thai meat and give it a good beating with a heavy pestle . Living on $500 a month ( 16,500 THB ) is n't on if you can spell McDonalds backwards and cant walk 200 yards without waving down a tuk tuk . Living like the locals is the only way to survive on that level of money . <p> Agreed . Living like a Thai person will keep your costs down , but its difficult for the majority of Westerners to pick up that lifestyle and give up all of their comforts and conveniences from back home . That 's what gets ya ! We also stay away from McDonalds here and do n't  use tuk-tuks ! <p> If you are going to work at a government school for one year , and will continue to stay in Thailand longer .

So many people are terribly disappointed with the disparity between what they read online and then how their lifestyle ends up in BKK or worse the islands . I lived in Bangkok for 2 years , with an average monthly expenditure of about $1500 living in a really nice modern condo in Silom ( plus extra for traveling on holidays and weekend trips ) and managed to save a lot of money .

Alcohol is crazily expensive Read more + <p> Yeah , its not that living affordably ca n't be done , but its an unwelcomed surprise when you find out something you like to use or do is disproportionally expensive . We feel your pain about the wine . While we can find bottles cheaper than $35 here in Thailand ( a drinkable one goes for no less than $20-25 ) , its something we 've had to pull back on the reigns big time . We agree with what you said living abroad is just full of surprises ! <p> Weve purchased bottles of wine from a vendor at the Saturday night walking street .

Wed be willing to give it another go though sure beats buying 700+ baht bottles from the store ! <p> Thanks for those information . My advice to get many products at the best price is to use the Thai internet site Lazada . You can compare with the price of the market or shopping center . You can pay at delivery . Delivery is free and quick.You can easily benefit of vouchers ( +/-10% ) . NB : international site can even be cheaper but then take into account some delays , delivery cost and you have to enter your credit card nr .

I 've travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai now for 2 months . Things like electronics and cell phones are certainly more expensive than back in North America . Western brand products are a premium . My monthly electrical is what really caught my eye . My first bill worked out to about two thirds of my rent . Luckily for me I do n't  drink and I enjoy Thai food , especially street food . But compared to Vancouver , Canada where I 'm from and where EVERYTHING is expensive , Thailand is a dream ! <p> You know it . Those imported brands you find back in Canada are all expensive here . Haha , you are not the first person to say their electric bill is 2/3 of rent since apartments can be so cheap ! Who knew you 'd ever say something as crazy as that ? ! ? ! Cheers to Thailand and that not everything is expensive like in Canada and the US ! <p> Amen . I have n't really had the need to buy some of the things you 've talked about , but I do think that Thailand can actually be pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent help with the more expensive costs . For me , it was grocery shopping . I went one time and quickly realized it just made more sense to go out to eat for every meal . <p> " Can we get an aaaayymen ? " hahaha If you 've managed to avoid those expenses ( furniture , cars , Western food and clothing ) , good for you . Sometimes they are hard to avoid . You are stronger willed than us about the Western grocery stores . We just cant resist going in there for some re-fried beans and peanut butter <p> We do n't  have a car or scooter so we use songtheaws , our feet and tuk tuks if we really need to go door to door ! While that saves us money , it comes out of our pocket in the many other ways you mentioned ! We are in Hua Hin now and have to make the trip to Bangkok for our letter of income from the embassy so that trip is not easy or cheap .

And living outside of touristy areas is helpful for two reasons : the cost of housing is even less and there are fewer Western stores and shopping centers to tempt you into spending money .

Life seems to be really different if you live in a non-touristy area and there 's more pressure to fit in . <p> Dear Chris &amp; Angela . A good article , thank you . However , being retired and living here in Chiang Mai for the past 20 years there are quite a few inaccuracies in your post ( in regards to vehicles for example ) . I think a little deeper research is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little extras especially when it comes to visas ( check out the cost for a retirement visa for example ) add up .

There are affordable things out there for sure , but its much harder without a close Thai friend ( something we did n't  have when we first moved here ) or a Thai significant other ( because , er , we have each other ) to show you the ropes . Often the most affordable options are dealt with or advertised in Thai and not English , which is intimidating ; on the flip side , homes for rent , stores , and restaurants that advertise in English attract English speaking foreigners . Its less stressful but they can be Read more + <p> Great post ! I would also add that while many handicrafts and handmade items or services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bargain down to the last penny . I do n't  think people really take into consideration how long it actually takes to make something and what the skill is worth . I 've seen people try to bargain clothing and crafts down to nothing and even try to get tattoos for $30everyone here still needs to make a living and its very hard to get ahead or save anything when prices are so low ! <p> Playful bartering is good , and even encouraged , but you 're right its almost insulting to try to bargain down to a rock bottom price when these people have worked hard to make their crafts . And $30 for a tattoo ? ! All we can say , you get what you pay for and it might not be pretty ! <p> Very nice post ! I am also not a believer of the live in Thailand on $500 a month articles . I have been to Thailand many times and yes the rent and good thai food are very inexpensive but electronics , vehicles , and alcohol are more expensive than here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its sometimes just easier to schedule buying new clothes around trips back to you home country . As far as the $82 for the passport pages , that 's the going price at any US Consulate or Embassy ( not just Thailand ) . Its just irritating its so dang expensive for some pieces of paper , " official " or not ! #ExpatProblems . <p> $500 is tough unless you live exactly like a Thai person , and in Bangkok , its almost impossible . I 've lived for $700-800 per month in Chiang Mai though , and lived in comfort ( example : rent was $190/month , electricity , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , buying western groceries can be a shocking experience in some cases ( especially for cheese and real butter ) <p> Doable living Thai style ?

But it means accepting living arrangements like cooking outside , having a sink , toilet and shower stall all with in the vicinity of each other in a wet bathroom , no AC , open-aired house that let 's critters in , no comfort foods ( cheese ! butter ! ) . Haha , do n't  get us started on Western groceries . We held off for as long as we could when we first moved here and then practically fell over when we saw the bill on our first shopping spree ! But boy , did that steak seared in butta taste like heaven ! <p> Great article ! However , I was one of the people who wrote that you can live cheaply in Thailand . And , I believe you can- there are things you mention in your blog that I do n't  do . For example , I do n't  consume alcoholic beverages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I purchase electronics .

We 've tried to eat Thai food every day and cut out alcohol , but then we get cravings for eggs and bacon or a good burger with some beer and it costs so much more ! Lifestyle plays a huge part of how you spend your money . If your are frugal by nature and do n't  need much to make you happy ( and in this case , live by Thai standards and not American standards ) , you can definitely live cheaply in Thailand .

This goes for anyone who wants to stay in the same Thai town for longer than a few days . Hotels and guesthouses may not explicitly advertise it , but often times they have weekly or monthly rates in which you save a ton in the long run . Definitely look into it for your next trip . <p> After traveling to Thailand many times to many different cities , it is expensive , but I am a tourist now , but in a few years I 'd like to retire there , but the 2,100 min , monthly U.S and the 29,000 U.S to put in a bank wich Im told I cant use if so I must put back within 90 days its beyond my reach for now I might have to stay here for awhile longer . <p> Being a little older than you two , I am looking to obtain health insurance . We pay $3500/yr being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20k if we live in the US . The exact same insurance costs $4k/yr and we can live in 123 countries including Thailand and visit the US . I think that if you include health insurance costs , Thailand , and a lot of other countries start to look much more affordable . <p> Based on your numbers , Thailand does sound like a great option ! Health insurance ( and the quality healthcare that goes along with it ) plays a big roll in many peoples lives , and that 's one thing that this country definitely offers . We plan to look into it more since its such a hot topic . <p> Great read ! Were currently researching a trip to Thailand and absolutely agree about the abundance of living off $ ( ridiculous amount ) a month in Thailand " blog posts . Its so nice to read a realistic experience and be able to plan the right way . Thanks : ) <p> Thanks ! We figured writing this gives a different but much needed perspective to travelers planning their monthly budgets . We know wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off $ ( ridiculous amount ) a month , cuz it would n't happen . Glad you see eye to eye ! <p> Chris , Great article . Thanks for your honesty . Living in San Diego , I have been using a excellent Mexican dentist for years . With the rise is Tijuana crime , I now drive over the border instead of walking . Mexican auto insurance is $31 per day , and would pay less than full value if my civic were wrecked or stolen . A recent dental implant required six trips south of the border . When you factor in gas , insurance , border wait times , my $1600 implant was closer to $1900. 60 minutes had a segment on the cost of cancer drugs in the US . Many people leaving the country just to afford cancer meds Keep up the great and informative articles . <p> A lot of people come to Thailand for major treatments and surgeries because there are so many well trained specialists , and more often than not , its more affordable than their home country . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply and demand , right ? It sounds like San Diegos supply was just too expensive so the need was met elsewhere . <p> Depends which countries you 're comparing . Over prescription and overcharging to farangs are also concerns . Insurance companies are getting wary of the use of unnecessary procedures in Thailand and India . And most Thai insurance companies cancel policies if they 're paying out too much . There are two sides to healthcare in Thailand . Its not always cheap . Ask those who are permanently settled here and are past the honeymoon period .. <p> Your blog usually gives unlike other travel blogs with vested interests in tourism both sides of an issue . <p> All true . But rent not cheap everywhere you go in Thailand either , Bangkok and anywhere further south a completely different story than the north . A lot of people think of Thailand as one homogenous place but there are huge differences in pricing depending on where you go . I remember the shock we had finding a decent apartment in Central Bangkok . Ended up paying more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! City living can be expensive , and were sure Thai condo/townhouse/home owners are well aware of the demand from foreign tenants in a place like Bangkok . On one hand its awesome to have a Western furnished house with all the bells and whistles , but on the other hand , its shocking to move abroad only to pay the same in rent , or more ! When we 've house hunted in the past , we just set our max budget and refuse to look at anything higher or else it just gets too tempting . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 27 days ago 161248 @qwx571248

@@59574545 @8574545/ <h> First Impressions of Phuket <p> After several years of blogging about Thailand , its- about time we 've explored the countrys- largest and most popular island . So in typical Tieland to Thailand fashion , let us share with you an overview of our first impressions of Phuket- ( pronounced " poo-get " , not " foo-ket " , and no , definitely not " fuk-it " you 'll thank us for that later ) . And let 's just say , " Wow , were we surprised ! " <p> Phuket is one of the few places in Thailand that we were not genuinely interested in visiting . But its constantly one of the most popular places in Thailand to visit . If vacationers , slow travelers , and expats are flocking there in the millions- every year , something must be good about it , right ? <p> So visit we did . During our time there , we did what some of Phukets vacationers and prospective expats do : we stayed in- a comfortable villa- rather than a hotel room , rented a car- instead of being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the southern half of Phuket as we could . <p> We have so much to share ! Although each category can be a post in and of itself , for now- well focus on the highlights of our first impressions of Phuket . Here goes : <h> Island layout and infrastructure : Very good <p> Although its an island , Phuket is fairly convenient to reach . That 's because it has a commercial airport ( Phuket International Airport HKT ) and- a bridge ( Saphan Sarasin ) connecting it to the mainland . These two options make it easy- to travel to and from the island . Typically , island travel involved coordinating bus , ferry , and speedboat schedules . This is not only stressful but adds- hours- ( if not a full day ) of traveling time . So for its airport and bridge , Phuket gets two thumbs up . <p> Phuket also has a huge- highway that runs ( generally speaking ) north to south through the island . In some stretches there are six lanes. - This superhighway makes it convenient to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get around a Thai island is to creep along the single congested road that twists and turns up and down the coastline , which takes on the burden of both local and tourist traffic . <p> Lastly , the expat-friendly areas of Rawai , Chalong , and Nai Harn are furthest away from the airport . At first- we were bummed to hear this , but after giving it a second thought we were glad these neighborhoods are . Tourists can conveniently enjoy the busy beaches and resorts closest to the airport while long-stay travelers and expats can have a little more peace and quiet further away from the touristy spots yet still access the airport by highway . <h> Restaurants : Some gems in a sea of- discord <p> Phukets restaurant selection is similar to every other touristy beach town we 've been to : there 's a plethora of- near-empty restaurants that offer a seemingly- identical- menu- 30-page book featuring **41;114;TOOLONG fare . Some- of these restaurants serve good food- and others serve marginally edible , unmemorable fare . <p> However , unlike some beach towns we 've been to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many times this was thanks to the recommendations given to us by fellow expats. - When we relied on Google or TripAdvisor reviews or were drawn in by big pretty restaurant signs , - the restaurants were- hit or ( mostly ) miss . <p> Of the 25+ restaurants we ate at during our two-week trip , these are the- places we thought were worth eating at again ( and in some cases , we did ) : <h> Expat needs : Excellent <p> Phuket made it really easy to feel at home as an expat. - At times we did n't  feel like we were in Thailand . Depending on what you 're looking for , this may be good or bad news . <p> There seemed to be no limit of high-end Western restaurants , massive air-conditioned malls , or home stores selling fancy kitchen appliances and plush furniture . We were wowed by the number- of car dealerships , international- grocery stores , and offices advertising services for foreigners . <p> As in other major touristy towns , the local Thai people spoke good English . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements in English . <p> On this trip , we enjoyed a taste of what life would be like if we were expats in Phuket . Instead of- living out of our suitcase at a guesthouse or hotel , we made ourselves comfortable in a Lofty Villas- vacation home- with a few friends . We had our own garage for our rental car- and- a Western kitchen where we cooked at least one meal a day . We had central air conditioning and hot water and even a yard with own pool , gazebo , and grill . It was a taste of what life could have been like if we lived in Phuket . It was pretty awesome and definitely our preferred way of exploring a new area ! <h> Variety of things to do : Unending selection <p> Wow , there are plenty of things to do in Phuket . Not only that , but the island goes beyond catering exclusively to singles looking to have a good time or millionaire retirees settling down in paradise . Phuket has activities and sites and attractions that appeal to families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and short-term vacationers . <p> On first glance , Phuket has a lot of high-end attractions . These top-dollar activities flood the search results if you Google- things to do in Phuket . There are fancy beach clubs , extravagant- spas , five-star restaurants , and luxury boats to enjoy . <p> But there are also tons of beach- and outdoor-lover activities . Kayaking , snorkeling and island hopping trips , parasailing , trekking , zip lining , exploring waterfalls , and jet skiing are just a few that caught our eyes . <p> There are also many markets ( day and evening ) and even a Sunday Night Walking Street in Phuket Old Town. - There are family-friendly activities , too . Museums and an aquarium , water parks , indoor playgrounds , and plenty of quiet beaches to take the little ones . Oh my , the many beaches ! <h> First impressions of Phukets beaches : So many ! <p> We had a great first impression of Phukets most popular beaches , Patong , Kata ( gut-dtuh ) , and Karon ( guh-rone ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices both for tourists and for expats hovered around mid range and went up exponentially from there . This is- relative to other cities in Thailand , not the world in general . <p> From what we observed , Phuket is not very suitable for people looking for things to do on a budget . That 's not to say there are n't  free things to do- because there are : hiking , relaxing on beaches , visiting viewpoints , to name a few . But in terms of organized tours and guided activities , the prices are more expensive than similar things to do- at any other beach town we 've been to ( Hua Hin , Ao Nang , Koh Mak , Koh Chang , Chumphon , and Koh Lanta ) . In other words , if you want to go on a group tour , take a cooking class , or have a spa treatment , expect to pay significantly more in Phuket than most other beach towns- for something similar . <p> Grocery store and produce market prices were the same to the prices we 've found in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gas prices and thought our two-week car rental price of 4,600 THB was a steal ( 330 THB per day ) . Items that were more expensive included hotels ( based on seasonal rates ) , touristy Thai restaurant prices , beer , and mixed drinks . <h> Driving : - Nerve-wracking <p> There 's no point in sugar-coating it : driving in Phuket was a bit scary . To make a long story short , the drivers in Phuket were , to various degrees : <p> unskilled ( first-time motorcyclists- wobbling down the road at half the speed limit ) <p> We also had some issues with the roads themselves . Some roads were gorgeous with their well-marked lanes , ample-sized shoulders , and well-lit views- at night . However , there were- roads in poor condition , too . We dodged countless potholes and randomly placed orange cones . There also seemed to be unending construction that left debris ( broken concrete , gravel ) and uneven pavement in its wake . <p> To make matter worse , on days it rained , the roads had huge puddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drainage systems or incorrectly sloped roads " we were worried about hydroplaning on the highways or hitting enormous hidden potholes on some of the smaller side roads . <p> Unfortunately , the 4G connection had weaker signals than we were used to . We had a difficult time sharing our experience of Phuket in real-time with our Periscope followers , our go-to social media platform . <h> Weather : Gorgeous when sunny , funs over when raining <p> According to one expat we spoke to , this year has been Phukets worst rainy season in 15 ( or was it 18 ? ) years . Of the two weeks we were in Phuket ( during- the tail end of the wet season ) , five days- were sunny and ten days were rainy . <p> And by rainy we do n't  mean it rained for two or three hours and then cleared up for the rest of the day . ( That 's what normally happens in Chiang Mai , the town we call home . ) No , the rain was relentless . It would go back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a 20-minute break , and then continue **25;157;TOOLONG until way past sunset . We were at the weathers mercy . <p> However , on the days the weather was clear , Phuket was gorgeous . If its a testament to what the non-rainy season is like , - then staying there from November to April is- a treat . <h> Were looking forward to going back to- Phuket <p> We were pleasantly surprised by how much we liked Phuket . Like , really liked it . Although it was pricey at times , we were blown away by just how gorgeous the island is , how many things there are to do , and how comfortable and convenient it was to be there as a foreigner . And that 's from both the perspective of vacationing there and living there. - We cant wait to go back ! <p> Chris and Angela , first of all , I am so happy to find you here as I am , like you , an expat who fell in love with Thailand Phuket , in my case . Ive been here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring many places across the country . Now , I 'm also starting to travel blog as I cant keep mum about how tourists or just-arrived-expats can experience Thailand in the most local way possible , or at least a rather fun and memorable one that 's totally different to the bad reputation it already has . Whenever you are ready to Read more + <p> Your blog will be helpful sounds like something we could have used on this latest trip ( we were bombarded with the same ten or super touristy things to do not interested ! ) Especially since you 've lived there for several years and have had time to really test things out . Kamala Beach was one of our favorites ! maybe well see you in January : ) <p> Nice ! I have n't been to Phuke too because of the bad rep I live in Bangkok now over a year , and spent 3 months on Ko Phangan/Samui/Tao Is the driving worse than Samui ? When I drove motorbike it seemed like the jerks in cars get commision if they put someone in hospital . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving goes , we personally did n't  really notice a significant difference between Samui and Phuket . Both places attract tourists who often do n't  think twice before hopping into a car or onto a motorbike with little to no experience . Phuket is definitely worth checking out if you have a chance . Cheers ! <p> Chris and Angela , thank you for writing this post ! My wife and I are doing what you two did and we are packing up and moving to Thailand . Although we will be moving to Phuket instead of Chiangmai , we have found your story and your blog really inspiring and helpful and this article just made us even more excited . Keep up the good work and thank you ! 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574548 @8574548/ <h> 10 American Habits We Lost After Moving to Thailand <p> We did a little reflecting on our life abroad and realized that there are definitely some American habits we lost after moving to Thailand . From being more low key and flexible to not taking life so seriously , we 've thought back to how Thai culture has rubbed off on us , and you know what , it has n't  been a bad thing ! <h> 01 Having High Restaurant Service Expectations <p> We 've both worked in restaurants when we were younger , so that 's definitely contributed to our forgiving attitude when we eat out and treating waitstaff with respect and patience . In Thailand , our patience has grown even more because we no longer expect the attentive service like we had growing up in America . <p> We do n't  expect our servers to tend to our table after our food is delivered . If an order is n't right , if were missing a side or condiment , or if we need a refill , we catch our servers eye and call them over . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the place is closing . <p> Special requests to the menu are acknowledged but are either completely ignored ( even though our server is nodding their head and say they understand us ) or it comes out wrong . Once we ordered a cheeseburger but the menu only offered hamburgers . What we got was a bun with a slice of cheese without a burger no joke ! <p> We do admit seeing a Caution : Hard Hat Area sign where construction was being performed . Yeah , several times , actually . <p> At first we were startled to see such lack of warning signs in Thailand . How could people properly function in society without being spoon fed safety warnings ? ! But the longer we lived here , the more refreshing it was.One can argue that Thai citizens and foreigners are expected to open their eyes and take responsibility for their own actions . <p> And you know what ? Using common sense works ! <p> To this day , no one we know has gotten hurt by their own lack of awareness and tried suing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident happened . Americans , take a hint ! <h> 03 Depending on a Car and All the Road Rules <p> Owning a motorbike and using it as the main vehicle seems to be pretty common in Thailand but oh-not-so-much in the USA . We jumped on that bandwagon and traded in our car for a motorbike since the weather is motorcycle friendly year round and we do n't  have to drive hundreds of miles a week anymore . We also walk more and use public transportation such as trains , buses , and songthaews that are plentiful in many Thai towns . <p> Yes , we 've given up car-related luxuries like being able to listen to the radio , cool off with air conditioning , protect ourselves from the rain and sun , style our hair without fear of it matting from a helmet , and having plenty of trunk space for groceries . <p> On the flip side , we think its pretty great keeping our expenses down ( we could afford to buy our bike in cash and now spend less than 1,000 baht per month on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long lines of traffic , plus park wherever we want . <p> As far as road rules , were still safety nuts and wear our helmet when riding around on our motorbike . We also carry with us our Thai driver licenses and motorbike registration/green book if were pulled over . <p> But beyond that , we 've learned to drive like the locals do . Strictly abiding by road rules isdefinitely one of those American habits we lost after moving to Thailand . Sometimes its actually safer to break conventional road rules and just go with the flow of traffic . <h> 04 Wearing Shoes Indoors <p> In Thailand we wear our shoes in most buildings , but we always remove our shoes when entering someones house and leave them at the entrance . Always . <p> In fact , our shoe purchases are based around whether they are easy to slide on and off . Buh-bye laces ! <p> Now a days we have an inner battle when someone says " Oh , its ok if you leave your shoes on " and they proceed to walk into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it and default to taking off our shoes . In fact , if there 's carpet , were downright squeamish at the idea of wearing shoes inside because of how filthy the soles are . <h> 05 Being Carefree in the Sun <p> In America , golden bronzed skin is often seen as the symbol of having leisure time and vacation money . In Thailand , untanned skin is preferred . Combined with the fact that were just about to hit our 30s and can see evidence of those infamous fine lines , were more conscious of sun exposure . <p> Often we wear sunblock or make it a point to stand in the shade . Sometimes we wear long sleeves or light jackets in the blazing sun so we do n't  burn , even if its over 100 degrees . Angela goes nowhere without her umbrella . What we used to think was silly when people walked around under an umbrella on a non-rainy day , we now think is very practical . We prefer that small circle of shade to the burning Thai sun . <p> We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our skin , though , which is all too common in Thailand . <h> 06 Living a Fast Paced Life <p> Life has slowed down a lot in Thailand ! We were both type A personalities back in the US with a go-go-go mentality but now we have much more laid back attitudes . Its because we have a flexible schedule ( blogging and freelancing at home sure beats long commutes and 40+ hour work weeks in an office ) and the Thai mai bpen rai attitude has rubbed off on us , too . <p> With an open schedule , we are n't  pressured to do anything . This means leisurely taking care of adult responsibilities and errands , but it also means we do n't  feel the need pack our weekends full of activities , either . <p> We welcome our time to relax , too . Before , Angela thought that an hour and a half of yoga class was boring and a waste of time . Shed prefer 30 minutes of intense cardio or weightlifting instead . There was no room in her schedule to indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physically relaxing yoga session and feels great afterwards . <h> 07 Being On Time <p> About that <p> We are no longer punctual and do n't  expect others to be on time either . Meeting friends for coffee or lunch ? Even if we arrive 15 minutes late and our friends are n't  there , we do n't  stress about it just wait patiently until they arrive . It used to be we would get a slew of texts or calls if we were two minutes late . Now were on Thai time . <p> There are times where it is important to be on time in Thailand , such as catching the bus or a flight , because those still leave on schedule . We cant get too lax ! <h> 08 Paying with Credit Cards <p> Thailand is a cash-based society . So aside from whipping out credit cards to make a rare purchase at a major grocery store or mall , we had to get comfortable with handling paper money and coins . <p> That meant recognizing the new currency ( and heaven forbid not handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill ) , picking through coins in our wallet while people queued up behind us , and correctly doing mental math , typically in Thai , in our head for the correct amount or change . <p> It also meant planning ahead for an evening out or other expenditures and asking ourselves , " Do we have enough cash on us or do we need to swing by the ATM ? Do we have enough money at all , or do we need to wait until next week when we have more funds ? " <p> After paying off all of our debt before moving to Thailand and then adjusting to a pay-as-you-go lifestyle , we prefer this because it helps us stay debt free . It sure beats spending beyond our means and racking up credit card debt . <h> 09 Needlessly Spending Money <p> We have better control over our spending habits . Without the constant bombardment of commercials ( none here on our English channels or on Netflix ) , magazine advertisements , or radio commercials ( we cant listen to any on our motorcycle ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gadget or service . <p> We 've also scaled way back on impulse buying . It used to be that wed buy a bottle of wine or six pack of microbrew on our commute home . Or a few plants for our deck during an afternoon shopping spree . Or a 55 inch flat screen TV . You know , just cuz . This is one of those American habits we lost after moving to Thailand and do n't  regret it one bit . <p> Most of all , after spending over six months selling our belongings and whittling everything down to two checked bags and a carry-on each before moving to Thailand , we still have a lingering fear of collecting too much junk and having to do it all over again . Before we buy anything , we usually ask ourselves if we would feel like selling it later ? The answer is almost always " No. " <h> 10 Relying on Modern Day Appliances for Domestic Chores <p> We do n't  own a dishwasher , a garbage disposal , a clothes dryer , or an onsite water filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancy kitchen appliances that are in most American households . <p> We hand wash our dishes and are careful to keep the sink strainer in place so food bits do n't  clog the pipes . Its not as convenient , but at least were thankful that the kitchen is inside our house since that is not often the case in traditional Thai houses and even some apartments . <p> We line dry our clothes because we do n't  have a clothes dryer . And while we prefer the smell of sun dried laundry , we 've learned that clothes fade faster if left out in the direct sun and they definitely stretch out without the high heat of a dryer to shrink them back into shape . You should see the size of some of our ankle socks ! We also have to schedule our laundry around the weather and cant do it on rainy or cool days or else we have to bring the drying rack inside and point our floor fan on it . <p> One thing that 's tedious is planning ahead making sure there 's enough drinking water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we 've settled in for the evening and want to cook rice or pasta . <p> And as far as kitchen appliances like toasters , blenders , coffee makers , or food processors , we do n't  have any of these . Since we have no idea how long we will be living in Thailand or even how long well be in the same house or apartment , we rather not have to deal with boxing them up and shipping them every time we move . Toast is overrated and we use a small French press , anyways . <h> We Do n't  Regret the American Habits We Lost After Moving to Thailand <p> So some of our habits reflect some sacrifice on our part , but mostly we think our experiences have been positive and character building . We think the biggest change we 've seen in ourselves is being more patient and allowing ourselves to relax . No matter where you are from in the world , we think everyone could use a little more patience and relaxation in their lives , do n't  you think so ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well have been written about where I live . Probably similar in a lot of Asian countries , actually .

I live in Germany where being a minute late is a sin so taking my German husband and half British/ half German son to Thailand was a challenge .

Both husband and son survived and loved Thailand very much . <p> Maybe we should n't have so many warning signs in the States . Look what happened to the dumb Texas guy , around the 4th of July . He got into the water , although he saw a sign warning about alligators in the water . He said " f the alligators " and got eaten for lunch within minutes . Girlfriend made it out alive . <p> Ive been here for a few years.I like to keep it simple , when ordering .

Weve learned to drink ice in our beer because the heat warms it up to a temperature that we find unpalatable if we do n't  drink it fast enough . Still , no complaints ! <p> As far as " everyone could use a little more patience and relaxation in their lives " , I believe you are correct . Fast paced , got ta have it , got ta have it now attitudes are bad for the heart and your mind . SLOW DOWN people ! In Indonesia they call it " rubber time " . Take a lesson folks .

@@59574550 @8574550/ <h> Chiang Mai to Pai Travel Guide <p> Chiang Mai to Pai is a route not short of travel options . The small mountain town of Pai , Thailand is located in the northwest of Thailand not far from the Myanmar border . It is roughly a three hour ( 135 km ) drive from Chiang Mai on twisty , wooded , and elevated mountain roads . The route is simultaneously dangerous and beautiful and offers endless breathtaking mountainside views of rural northern Thailand . <h> How to Get from Chiang Mai to Pai <p> There are actually several different options if you plan to travel from Chiang Mai to Pai . Whether you want to go it alone on a motorbike , or travel with a group of friends via bus or flight , there is no shortage of available methods . <h> Motorbike <p> We drove our 2013 Honda Forza from Chiang Mai to Pai , but we only recommend traveling on a motorbike if you are experienced . - You must be willing to ride through possible rain showers ( bring a poncho ) and dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Route 1095 . If you do ride a motorbike , make sure you have plenty of gas before turning off of Route 107 onto Route 1095 as the gas stations are very few and far between for the remainder of the trip . Also , during the rainy season be prepared to negotiate muddy portions of the road . - With all this said , we had a blast riding through the mountains ! <h> Bus <p> If you are not conformable driving a motorbike from Chiang Mai to Pai , there are other ground transportation services that can be booked , many of which leave several different times throughout the day . <p> Larger buses operated by Prempracha Transport depart from Chiang Mais Arcade Station Terminal 3 every few hours , but take a bit longer because they are forced to drive slower given the road conditions . These cost 150 baht . We recommend buying them in advance and arriving at the bus station at least 30 minutes prior to departure . The bus schedule departs at 7:00am , 9:00am , 10:30am , 12:00pm , and 2:00pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bus <p> Vans and mini buses can be booked at various agencies in Chiang Mai and average between 72 and 180 baht ( $3.50 to $6 USD ) for a one way ticket . Often , your hotel or guesthouse can hail a van for you for a small booking fee . Weve heard good things about the AYA Bus Service , which runs mini vans with air conditioning from Pai to Chiang Mai and back . They will pick you up from your hotel in Chiang Mais Old City thirty minutes to one hour before departure . They leave from Chiang Mai to Pai every hour between 7:30am and 5:30pm . <p> As a warning , the twisty road between Chiang Mai and Pai often makes people car sick . We recommend taking an anti-nausea pill ( such as non-drowsy formula of Dramamine ) before getting on the road to prevent discomfort and possible embarrassment during the ride . Remember , it is about a three hour trip and drivers make a 15 minute bathroom stop about halfway through the trip . However , they do n't  stop if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option to get to Pai , Kan Airlines offers very short flights between Chiang Mai and Pai that cost 1890 baht or $60 USD for a one-way ticket . Flights operate between Chiang Mai International Airport and land at Pais small local airport located roughly 2 km north of town . As of September 2013 , Kan Airlines is operating one flight per day on Fridays , Saturdays , and Sundays . Flights depart from Chiang Mai at 10:20am and arrive in Pai at 10:45am . Flights depart from Pai at 11:00am and arrive in Chiang Mai at 11:25am . <h> Directions from Chiang Mai to Pai <p> Leave the Old City of Chiang Mai- via Route- 107 ( Chang Phuak Rd ) , which is a north bound highway that originates at Chiang Mais North Gate . Drive approximately 30 km and then turn left onto Route- 1095 , which will be at a big intersection with signs pointing towards Pai . Route- 1095 passes through several very small towns , goes up and down two mountains , and has 746 turns . Stay on Route- 1095 for 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd recommend getting one step up from a Ford Focus since some of the hills to Pai are steep get a car with an engine just over 1.5L , but a 4+4 is not necessary .

@@59574553 @8574553/ <h> Do n't  Become a Teacher in Thailand If <p> Teaching English is the go-to job for foreigners- who wish to earn money while living in Thailand . But its not that easy. - I think that many prospective teachers , myself included , simply do n't  know what they 're getting after accepting a position at a Thai school. - Before you think itll be a breeze to become a teacher in Thailand , there are a few things worth considering. - They are especially true if you 've never taught before . <p> I- get it teaching abroad sounds like a dream . For some people , the only thing separating them- from becoming a teacher in Thailand is a one-way ticket abroad . Theyve already doubled checked Thailands basic- teaching requirements and theyve- already earned a- TEFL certification- ( recommended for first-timers ) . <p> As many- times as I 've heard that teaching is among- the hardest , least appreciated , and most underpaid jobs out there , these truths still apply in Thailand . Yes , it- will continue to be- a physically and an emotionally demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier just- by crossing a few countries borders . <p> And so , I wanted to put a few things into perspective. - For those who are considering taking- their teaching career abroad or for those who simply want a reason to stay in Thailand and think teaching is- easy money , you may be in for a rude awakening . <p> Simply put , you may- not want to become a teacher in Thailand if <h> You Ca n't Tolerate Deliberate Ignorance or Failure <p> Aside from a few exceptions , - the Thai education system has a no fail policy . So whether or not a student participates in class , puts effort into a task , or understands the material , they pass . <p> Many foreign teachers accept this system for what it is and grade on a curve without question . I envied those teachers who can teach with enthusiasm even though they have students in their class who couldnt- be bothered to learn . <p> For me , this was a source of a lot of heartache. - I had a hard time accepting- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth effort , or understand the material in class but were still- rewarded with passing grades . I could n't wrap my brain- around the concept of giving a passing grade that had not been earned. - In fact , just writing this nearly makes my head explode . <p> If grades do n't  matter , then why make teachers ( like myself ) give and record grades at all ? I wish I could take those precious hours wasted on grading and put them towards something that matter to me whether researching better teaching techniques , finding better classroom material , or hell , napping . <p> To make a long story short , it was a personal struggle whenever I had a- student turn in a project or worksheet on which they merely doodled , knowing that the lowest grade they could get was a 60% . <p> And it gets worse : I- couldnt sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation with these students , hoping to motivate- or inspire them , because they would n't have understood me ! Those who handed in blank worksheets were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , even though they could n't understand English . <p> I have since read dozens of articles about Thailands education culture ( i.e. , losing face over poor grades , cheating is- considered helping a struggling friend ) as well as Western topics on education and how a child should n't be judged by their grades. - Still , I shake my head . <h> You Think You Do n't  Need to Speak Thai <p> A common question , and one that I was personally curious about before becoming- a teacher , is : <p> Can you teach English without speaking Thai ? Well , yes . ( At least that 's what I kept reading on various blogs and forums . ) <p> Will your students really understand you ? Probably not . <p> Ok , - to be fair , this depends a lot on whether you are teaching introductory or advanced level English . Knowing how to speak and write Thai is invaluable if you are teaching beginners . <p> I taught students from five years old to eleven years old ( phratom 1 through 6 ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second year students because they were beginners . Lord help me if a student misplaced their pencil , felt sick , or worse did not understand the directions for a worksheet or game . I relied so heavily on my Thai assistant teacher to translate directions and to keep my youngest students focused on their task that on my best days I felt challenged- and on my worst days I felt worthless . <p> As for my students in fifth and sixth grades , their English speaking and writing abilities varied so greatly that my top students translated for the ones who did n't  understand . At least I was able to connect with the students who spoke English and I was grateful for that , as much as they were grateful for me attempting to communicate in Thai . <p> I did notice that speaking basic Thai to- my students got their attention and they respected me a helluva lot more- when I finally learned how to say " Listen to the teacher , " - " Sit down , " " Line up , " and " Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic improvement in the classs performance and understanding when I included the Thai vocabulary word alongside a new English word . This was actually done against- the direct orders of my schools principle , who had instructed all English teachers to never use Thai . I shrugged it off <p> By far the most successful and well-liked English teachers at my school spoke- Thai . They- were able to casually communicate with the students , give directions and any followup clarifications , - and even understood a student when he or she had a problem . The students loved them . <p> TIP : Keep an ear out for the commands that your fellow Thai teachers use . - Listen to what and how they say it- rather than- using the literal translation from , say , Google . <h> You Need to Be " In the Know " <p> I 'm not sure why this happened , but the foreign English teachers at my school never knew the schedule of school events . This included events- that we were required to attend , to actually participate in , or even- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 24 hours notice to prepare . <p> And this wasnt just at my school . There was a- general consensus among friends of mine who taught elsewhere who- had the same experience . <p> One time I was told to participate in ta teacher soccer competition for- Sports Day- and at the last second was told to wear a green shirt because it was my- team color . I had to spend my time and money buying a solid Crayola- green shirt because it was very important- that I play soccer while wearing my team colors . <p> Other times the English teachers found- out the hard way that the supply shop was closed - for the day . Or that we needed to have submitted our worksheets to the copy room- yesterday- because the photocopy machine was now being repaired . That 's because none of the Thai staff told- us ! <p> A language barrier ? Culture difference in priorities ? Simple forgetfulness ? To this day I have n't found out why there was little to no planning in advance . <h> You Do n't  Like Children <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like children you wo n't like being a teacher . <p> I will be the first to say Thai children are ah-DOR-ruh-bul . And they love having fun and are playful as much as any other child . <p> But they are still children . <p> Even the super cute Thai students- cry and yell and ask many many questions ( to which you give answers many many times ) , and they have a hard time understanding simple directions or using their gross motor skills . Heck , sometimes they just ca n't be convinced to listen and learn and do the task they are supposed to be doing . <p> With the older students , its all of this plus attitude . <p> And then everything is exasperated because of the language barrier ! <p> Perhaps you do n't  yet know if you like or dislike children . If that is the case , teaching will certainly- help you figure that out . <h> You Do n't  Want to Bring Work Home <p> Unless you are conveniently provided with lesson plans , student workbooks , tests , and classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of after-hours work . <p> You know that dreamy image of yourself kicking back and relaxing on a tropical beach after an easy days work teaching English ? - Nope . Scratch it . It- wont happen nearly as often as you 'd like , if at all . <p> There 's a good chance that- grading and creating lesson plans will roll over in your personal time- no matter how hard you try to take care of everything- during your planning periods at school . And do n't  forget about designing worksheets or shopping for materials if those are n't  readily provided to you . <p> If you are lucky and find a good online teaching resource , you wont be creating your worksheets from scratch like I did . Unfortunately , it- still takes time to find the right teaching material online and often the good stuff does n't  come free . <p> I say this about Thailand but I think its safe to say that teachers everywhere spend their own time and money to take care of school-related tasks . <h> You Do n't  Have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as an eight year veteran of the restaurant industry . A typical teaching day had me standing between five or six hours every day out of my eight hour shift . This was split between writing on the board for the first part of the class and then walking around answering questions and assisting students- for most of the remaining time . <p> How some teachers manage to- sit down most of the day blows my mind . <p> Something I had n't  realized before I became a teacher in Thailand is that speaking for 5+- hours a day is exhausting . My ears and voice box were worn out at the end of most days so I talked much less in my off time . <p> You know the phrase " Breakfast is the most important meal of the day " ? Before my teaching days , I 'd drink a cup of coffee for breakfast and then eat- my first meal a few hours later . But when I was a teacher , I found myself completely wiped out- if I did n't  properly fuel my- body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip breakfast ! <p> Now , combine all of these and throw the following wrench into the mix : try teaching in a tropical country with no air conditioning. - Air conditioning is n't a standard amenity in schools , so some teachers settle for cross-breezes and fans . I think my classroom hovered around 27 C ( 80 F ) and I was always feeling sluggish . <h> Should you become a teacher in Thailand ? <p> Teaching is n't an easy job , but every job has its ups and downs , right ? Hopefully this gives a more realistic perspective into the world of teaching in Thailand rather than the- more- romanticized versions- out there . <p> I encourage people to teach in Thailand for the sake of making a- difference in a childs life or to be part of a community that shapes young minds .

I have travelled Thailand a few times and simply fell in love with the country . I have always felt I would love to teach but have mainly worked in admin . Is there any hope for me ? I would so appreciate your thoughts . <p> No , not unless you apply at lesser desirable schools . Without a higher education degree , you are not legally eligible for a Work Permit , although that does n't  mean you cant earn money ( just under the table ) like many other expats before you . Sorry to be the bearer of bad news . Perhaps you could look to volunteer work to fullfill your passion . <p> May I just offer an opposing positive opinion ?

Most that I 'm aware of take a significant chunk of your paycheck , and there are numerous stories of many agencies not bothering with the proper paperwork for their clients at all . <p> Yes , definitely do your research because bad hiring agencies can be more trouble than they are worth .

Its amazing the number of foreign teachers I encounted who were long term residents ( 5+ years ) that simply hated Thailand . In the staffroom , they would be there , complaining about everything from the people , the weather , the system , the food and the culture to no avail . I understand its normal to gripe about things and that Thailand is n't for everyone . Its normal to encounter culture shock and dislike things about a place . Heck , Thailand definitely Read more + <p> Very true words . I heard the bad talk from time to time ( both from teachers and generally dissatisfied expats ) .

My husband has been asked by one of the Thai government universities how much he would accept as a an expatriate lecturer please do have an idea of such , also what other benefit one can get as expatriate.l my self study education so l have certificate in education will l be able to get a teaching job . what the cheapest international school fees for age 6 11 , how much can a family of 5 live with on monthly basis . hope to hear from you soon <p> I am not familiar with what university lectures . International school teachers can earn 55,000 to 60,000 baht per month ( lower end ) . To be comfortable with a blend of Thai and Western living style , we like to aim for 1,000 USD per adult and 500 USD per child per month . <p> Hi , I just love your blog. you sound as though you are living the dream ( as hard as it must be of course ) Well i am ready to test this dream out for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballet over in Australia . <p> Thank you for all the information that you provide in your Blog . I am sure everyone who reads your blog takes so many things away from it . I see that you inspire a lot of people to make the move from Tieland to Thailand . <p> Hi Chris and Angela Looks like the amount farang teachers will be diminishing soon with the changes to the tourist visas and replacing foreign teachers in government schools . Ive tried teaching in Thailand a couple of times , it was ok , but I think its not the job role for me ! Although I might try an online teaching app 555 <p> We heard about the news too : / It will be very interesting to see how many teachers end up leaving because of these rules and its sad how many schools will be affected . Maybe its time to simply move on for some <p> Your blog has seriously been incredibly helpful as I look for teaching positions in Thailand . I am currently teaching visual arts in Indonesia at a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in my contract ( pretty amazing ! ) . My fiance and I want to live abroad after we get married this summer and finding jobs in Indonesia is extremely difficult .

Fortunately , I have found art teacher openings in a Read more + <p> Glad to be of help ! That 's good news you 're in contact with schools that will specifically hire you as an art teacher . Sometimes positions other than teaching English can be hard to find . Yes , we would recommend that you apply for your art position first while he is getting a TEFL certificate . Once you two are married and you are hired as an art teacher , your **25;184;TOOLONG will be eligible for a Non Immigrant O Visa ( dependent ) while you are on the Non Immigrant B Visa . As for your second question the school pays you ( we are n't  sure what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold as to guess that the no-fail policy applies ONLY to English classes . And I believe this relates to its low importance on the scale as in , virtually not important , and the kids are in on the game from day 1 . Mmm , so much for the relentless push of ASEAN with English being nominated as the common business language . How will Thailand really prepare itself ? <p> I am one of the fortunate ones that love my teaching job in Bangkok . I am also fortunate that my school will fail students if they do not do the work . I questioned this recently and was amazed to discover several Mathayom 1 students have to repeat the whole year .. This has restored some of my lost confidence in the Thai education system . <p> Great article but do disagree with you on one point.Speaking to your students in Thai.I have been a teacher here for 5 years and would not and will not speak to my students in Thai.I teach all my classes using simple English , teach everything in context and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , others a bit longer but they do eventually get it.I find that if you speak to your students in Thai they will talk to you in Thai.If they ask a question in Thai , translate it into English and get them to repeat it.That works for Read more + <p> Im impressed you 've been able to teach without using Thai at all ! I appreciate a teacher willing to be repetitive I learn best after hearing and saying a Thai word about 20 times before I remember it , but I also like to make a quick connection with vocabulary instead of playing guessing games . I know a big part of it was that I did n't  like hearing myself talk so much I could say " Write you name " ( on the top of a worksheet , for the youngest kids ) four or five times or I could say " aa+a+a+a+a+a++aa+ , write your name " Read more + <p> I actually considered teaching as a way to fight boredom when I go there , but working my tale off for $800 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ive been teaching in Esaan for three years and being able to speak Thai has become an invaluable survival tool . I also had an assistant in my current school but I found shed often be daydreaming during classtime which would often ruin the flow of the lesson ( constantly waited for her to translate and doing it badly . ) Grading is still a bang your head on the desk experience so I try to reward class participation and behavioural/general improvement during class whilst keeping the grading issue in Read more + <p> That 's what I have a problem with being mislead . I much rather my information source ( whether it be a forum or recruiters ) give me the perks and the challenges and allow me to make an educated decision for myself instead of having a romanticized picture painted for which I am i 'll prepared and then crash and burn . That 's my inspiration behind posts like this . Its good you 've figured out a way that works well for you . Keep it up ! <p> I taught for a public school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually lucked out , teaching corporate classes and in a private language center that was really fulfilling . I got to teach some interesting people , including the son of a Thai Army Commander , on location at their house on the Army base in Ari , and the son of the former governor of Bangkok . I also got to teach post-graduate students and students going for their PhDs at Harvard . That was a ton of fun and very rewarding . <p> Its good to hear that your teaching experiences outside of public schools were all worth it . You 're the second commenter who mentioned corporate teaching being very rewarding . I 'll keep that in mind and would be open to teaching in that setting if the opportunity ever crosses my path . And its pretty cool to hear of the people you meet and learn about their backgrounds ! <p> Excellent write up . I teach English in Thailand but fortunately Ive managed to stay out of the school system . I teach corporate in and around Bangkok . And aside from having to know Thai ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to avoid all the other items on your list .

I think what you 're doing would be a better position for me since I have some experience training adults and I think I connect with them better than kids . Yeah , I 'd be much more open to teaching corporate and sounds like you have a healthier working relationship with everyone , too . Thanks for sharing ! <p> If you can not handle need-to-know basis style of administration and Thailands version of No Child Left Behind ( wink wink ) , then no , you should n't teach here . But any teacher who 's on their feet for " 5-6 hours a day " ( 25-30 contact hours ) is getting taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contact hours should be around 18-22 , maxing out at 24 if short staffed .

They seem to be enjoying teaching in Read more + <p> Meh , being in the know ( or the lack thereof ) is probably not the number one deciding factor for most people looking to teach . I would n't go so far as making that an ultimatum for not teaching . Heck , you just learn to shrug it off Thai style , right ? Mai pben raaiiiiii . Sure , one could argue I was taken advantage of , especially since I was a first-time teacher and did n't  know what to look out for . All of the teachers at my school had 24 classes per week schedule so I had no reason to question the work load until months later Read more + <p> I 'm always interested to learn about the education systems in Asia . The more I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in certain countries . After living in Indonesia for a year I was really surprised by their education system .

I had no idea , but I 'm not sure that 's something I would be comfortable with <p> Oh my , teachers just do n't  show up and Indonesia schools allow this ? Yikes ! Although I 'm sure the students are happy about not having class : ) Yeah , the no fail policy really bugged me . I could n't do much to get students to participate in class if they did n't  want to because there was no consequence . However , the worse offenders did get spend their recess ( also my lunch and break time , grrr ) making a half-hearted attempt at completing an assignment .

As for the no fail policy , that is n't universally true in every school . I failed two students last semester who are now repeating Pratom 1 this year .

There are worse jobs that are unreasonably demanding and Read more + <p> There were good things about my school ( not all bad , I swear ! ) , but I wish I had spoken to some of the teachers before deciding to work there . I felt a bit pressured to take the first job offered to me by my hiring agency , but that 's my own fault . I agree with you shop around . But even if you pick the best gig , your first year will be a challenge as you learn the ropes . Thanks for commenting ! <p> The " no fail " concept is something I just learned about in the last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to end up doing some teaching at some point and its good to get a more realistic view . At least I can read and write Thai . How a school can ban using Thai to help communicate with students is harsh . Ca n't change things , just have to be ready for it ! Very helpful article ! <p> Crazy , is n't it ? That 's very helpful that you can read and write Thai that 's great ! I used to write the vocabulary on the board in Thai and basic sentences to help with grammar structure ( which , in turn , helped my Thai : ) ) I could n't not do it after I realized how helpful it was to students , so I had to bite the bullet and use it even though the school said not to . Glad to help ! <p> Wow ! You said that so well . I had a funny feeling that after completing my TEFL course that teaching English in a foreign country , be it Thailand or Costa Rica , would be a great way to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go through , I have come to realize that its a lot harder than I 'd like it to be . All these teaching courses out there telling you how great teaching English can be , Ive come to the conclusion that its a lot tougher in reality .

If teachers learn from my mistakes , then they should have a smoother ride . Let 's just say I am not unhappy for not teaching anymore : ) <p> I taught for 42 years in Canada ; grades 5 to 12 , and post-secondary . Outside of minimal language issues , all the other problems you enumerate were ubiquitous in all of my classrooms . Only in a post-secondary milieu , would the slackards get their just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have zero interest in teaching again . In fact , W*O*R*K is a bad 4-letter word in my estimation ! I do admire the dedicated teachers who struggle on in spite of the problems . <p> Haha , " work " is a four letter word I think some people will agree on that ! I also admire teachers who overcome obstacles . There are many things going against them but they keep their heads held high . I have an entirely new respect for them ! <p> As much as I enjoy living in Thailand , the longer I stay here the more I notice . Now you have given me an understanding of their education system , no wonder I think it is a country going nowhere quickly . I sometimes wonder how anything actually gets done in this place , then they amaze me with something they have done really well . Hard to wrap your head around how they think sometimes , but that 's half the fun living here . But still a little shocked on what you state with regards to them all getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to retire , and seriously considering a move to Thailand . I have a MBA and have done years of substitute teaching in a number of states all grades and subjects . Is it necessary to complete a program in order to teach there ? Anything else you can tell me would help . I notice most of the pictures and information is from/for much younger people . I 've spent the last 20 years as Director of Safety and security for airlines . I 'm sure that does n't  help but one never knows . Thanks for any help you can share . Charlie <p> If you have your MBA ( minimum is a BA or BS ) and have years of teaching experience , you are eligible to teach . As far as programs go , we like to think a TEFL is a qualifier and good for first time teachers or people who have never taught English as a second language before . Thailand is discriminatory ( age , sex , nationality , hair/eye color ) during the hiring process , but do n't  let this discourage you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and you definitely qualify .

@@59574556 @8574556/ <h> 5 Things We 're Glad We Did Before Moving to Thailand <p> A decision as big as moving to another country involves a- good bit of groundwork to make sure things run smoothly . So before moving to Thailand whether during- a gap year , for a sabbatical or retirement , or simply because you want to start a new life abroad , here are five things were glad we did in preparation for our move- ( and think you should do , too ) . <p> Its- understandable that certain situations may prompt a sudden move to Thailand . After all , life is unpredictable. - But if its- possible , even with- your unique circumstances , we would n't recommend suddenly jumping ship and moving to Thailand without adequate preparation . We suggest taking the time to get all your finances and belongings in order , getting support from your friends and family , doing your research on Thailands towns to see which one is best for you , and if possible , visit Thailand before you commit- to moving here . <h> 01 - Pay Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a college loan , and two car payments before moving to Thailand . Why ? Because we- did n't  want those payments hanging over our heads before starting our new life abroad . We ( correctly ) assumed that our income would be much less in Thailand , which would make it very difficult to continue paying off our outstanding debt . <p> To pay off our debt , we cut back on eating out and completely stopped buying new clothes , entertainment items , or objects- for our apartment . We took it easy on the holidays prior to our move and focused our efforts on spending more time at home and doing things that were free or cost very little . We sold one of our cars two months before moving ( at a loss , but it saved us money in the long run ) and carpooled to work . <p> Even if our plans to move to Thailand fell through , we would have completely rid ourselves of our American debt. - It was a great feeling to make- our last payments on our student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the majority of our credit card debt . <h> 02 - Sell ( Almost ) Everything <p> With the exception the items we took to Thailand and a few extra things we left in storage , we got rid of everything we owned . It was both liberating and anxiety-inducing , but letting go of our material belongings was a good life experience . <p> We put- in storage a small box of important paperwork ( medical documents , taxes , 401k , and banking and credit card information ) , one box each of cold weather clothing ( in the event we visited our family in the winter months ) and ( do n't  judge ! ) a box of some really expensive kitchenware. <h> 03 - Research- Like Mad <p> We left no stone unturned during our research before moving to Thailand . Even before settling specifically on Thailand , we had done months of searching for information on other countries including Belize , Guatemala , Nicaragua , and Vietnam . <p> Once we agreed- on Thailand , we spent more time narrowing down a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through online forums , watching YouTube videos , and reading what we could from other travelers or expats . It was challenging finding information back in- 2012 when there was much less than there is now . Thats part of what inspired us to create this blog ! <p> We focused on cost of living , safety , expat communities , and infrastructure . For us , Chiang Mai fit the bill and had nearly everything we were looking for . <h> 04 - Visit Thailand First <p> Before quitting our job , selling all our stuff , and booking a one way ticket to Thailand , we actually visited Thailand first . This may be- impossible for some people due to schedule conflicts or lack of funds . But for us , ( well , for Angela ) it was necessary that we visit Thailand before saying goodbye to our old lives and starting something new abroad . <p> And so we honeymooned in Thailand and spent two weeks exploring- Bangkok , Krabi , and Chiang Mai . And while most people may not be newlyweds as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon , its still possible to take the trip- in between jobs , ask to take leave without pay , or rigorously save up time off , even if its just for a week . <p> And you know what ? Visiting Thailand for those two weeks was by far the best decision we could have made . Seeing and getting a feel for each town helped us decide if Thailand- was really right for us . <p> While we felt that the areas of Bangkok ( Sukhumvit ) and Krabi ( Ao Nang ) we explored were fun but a bit touristy , we immediately felt at home in Chiang Mai . It was an amazing moment when we realized that it would be totally possible to move to Thailands biggest- northern city . <p> Believe it or not , we even took a whole day visiting a realtors office to see what housing would be like and took a tour of a big chain supermarket- called Tesco . We were that serious ! <h> 05 - Gain the Support of Our Families and Friends <p> Before moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends on board with our big decision . While arguably it was our life to live and we should- could do whatever we wanted with it , it was important for us to have the support of our loved ones before we made such a leap . <p> We started early and went easy on everyone and made- no ultimatums . We shared articles we had found and pulled up videos about Thailand to share around the dinner table . We anticipated questions and ensured that we were prepared for almost anything . <p> Our biggest skeptic was Angelas dad , who could n't believe we were- throwing away our government jobs , our education , and our nice apartment and cars . He warmed up a bit after we had been there for a year and he saw that things we going well . It all- changed when he made a last minute trip to Thailand and spent nearly two weeks having an experience of a lifetime . He s been on board with us ever since and still has plans on coming back one day . <h> Preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is no one-size-fits-all way to prepare yourself before- moving to Thailand . And its not something that you can put a dollar amount to . But for all the people who are thinking about moving to Thailand , we hope that this sets you in the right direction . <p> Is there anything else you think is a necessity to do before moving abroad ? - If you 've already made the big move , what was your experience ? <p> LOVE Nancy Chandlers Map of Chiang Mai . We have n't heard about the release of a new version with a guide eBook , but based on the level of detail of her prior maps , we 'd say itd be a good investment . If you get it , let us know what you think ! <p> Chris , and Angela , Ive done all of the above . A few things that we are discussing at retirecheap , that might be helpful : Set up your banking .

Packaged week-long tours are nice in that transportation and hotels are taken care of for you , but we think they can be a bit tiresome at times because there is little down time and they are more expensive .

There is nothing like getting a group of friends together and taking a trip out for a night or two on a freshwater lake in Thai-style floating bungalows ! <h> Picture Camping , But On the Water ! <p> We 've never been to anything quite like the Mae Ngat Dam floating houses . They combine the best of boating and camping into one amazing rustic package . It sounded too good to be true when our Thai friend , Bee of Be Beez Cafe &amp; Guesthouse , first told us about them . <p> This was just the place to go for a mini vacation after our trip home to the US .

There is plenty of space for tanning and relaxing , and its the perfect setup to go swimming and tubing . Its easy to jump in the water from the deck , and some of us were even brave enough to climb a platform and jump from greater heights . <p> There are wooden tables and chairs on the deck , and even grills . All we had to do is ask for some charcoal , and then Bee worked her magic and made fried chicken wings and German styled potato salad . <p> TIP : Ask if there is a karaoke machine nearby . We recommend getting the rooms farthest from the singing since chances are the songs will last into the wee hours of the morning . <h> Restaurant <p> The floating bungalows have Thai restaurants or kitchens to prepare food . They serve delicious whole fish dishes , but there are also pork , chicken , and vegetable stir-fries and soups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dish . Breakfast is simple and Thai styled , consisting of jok ( rice porridge ) , fried rice , and omelets . Ours provided hot tea and instant coffee . <p> We had some meals delivered right outside our bungalow . Other times we enjoyed meals in front of the restaurant at a thatched-roof hut . Wherever we ate , we had a great view of the lake . <p> Adult beverages can be purchased at near whole-sale prices ( translation : cheap cheap ! ) and include drinking water , soda , soda water , large beers , Thai rum and whiskey . <h> Bungalows <p> The bungalows are generally very basic . The single-room cabins have a full sized bed , a vanity , and a fan . A word of warning , these beds were pretty hard ! The rooms also have a window and a mosquito net . The fan is plugged into the only two-prong outlet in the room . <p> Each room has a small bathroom outback with a shower and Western toilet . In ours , we could see the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flushed using a bucket of water . If you stay in a place with no sink , you can count on there being a water spout to wash your face and hands . Mind you , each company is a little different and have different room standards . <p> Some floating houses provide two-person tents in the case that rooms are full . These can rented for around 400 baht a night and patrons sleep on the deck .

The roads are in good condition , so its possible to rent a car or motorbike and drive yourself there . There 's overnight parking available if you decide to- take your own vehicle . <h> Directions <p> Exit Chiang Mai Old City via Thapae gate heading east on Thapae Road . Cross the bridge over the Ping River and remain straight as it becomes Charoen Muang Road ( Route 1006 ) . <p> The road twists and turns . At the T-intersection , follow the Mae Ngat Dam sign and turn right . <p> A few hundred meters you 'll see a brown Sri Lanna National Park sign . Turn left here . <p> Follow a second Sri Lanna National Park sign as the road curves right and then slightly left . <p> At the T-intersection , there will be another Sri Lanna National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters until the park entrance , hanging left at the Y in the road at the " Entrance " sign . <p> We 've also gotten to the Mae Ngat Dam floating houses by songthaew . Well ask the driver to stop at one of the markets along the highway and buy chicken wings , potatoes , easy-to-eat fruit , fried pork rinds , sticky rice , Thai chili paste , water , and beer . Then well tell him to come back and pick us up at a specific time the next day . <p> The entrance fee to the Sri Lanna National Park is 100 baht per person and another 20 baht per vehicle . <p> The final drop-off point is a brief ride around the bend in the dirt road . Here we waited a few minutes for the next available longboat , which costs 600 baht ( 20 USD ) per round trip per group . The boat ride from the pickup spot to the bungalows is roughly 15 minutes . <h> Contact Information <p> There are several floating house companies at the Mae Ngat Dam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that speaks Thai with limited English , so we recommend asking a Thai friend to make reservations . <p> At the parking area at the parks entrance there will be one or two songthaew/trucks that hang around tell the drivers and they will call ahead to the house boat before taking you a few hundred feet down to the lake .

That transition period can be a bit tough , but we wish you luck ! <p> People do n't  try to budget or watch their spending because its cheap so the more theyll spend . end up spending even more . Being a tourist and living in Thailand is different . Though street food cost 40bht , food in the market cost lesser , when you live there there 's a difference because it adds up . unlike being on a holiday short term tourist just splurge because its not going to be a place where they reside . Living a western lifestyle is n't cheap in Thailand and also depends what kind of western lifestyle . From an Asian country comparing to another Asian country Read more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap in a cheap country . Its about adjust and changing lifestyle and what lifestyle you want . One can live cheaply in Thailand and yet splurge all money or choose minimalist and still live happily without being too tight budgeted. develop countries everything cost more and we all pay more .

If its 100bht for electricity you still got ta cough Read more + <p> Your lifestyle is definitely a major contributing factor to how much you spend , no matter where you live . Your priorities affect your overall budget as well as keeping yourself in check and not overspending beyond your means .

One day they wake up and have nothing left ! <p> I enjoy reading this ! I am amazed at the amount of money people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend on stuff. Just because in Thailand it costs so much less ! LOL What a lot of people said here is also true whether you choose the minimal lifestyle or work hard for the money but hardly have time to enjoy it .

Its refreshing Read more + <p> Some of our favorite things to read are about cost of living comparisons of places around the world . It really puts it into perspective ! And yes , a change in lifestyle is also necessary . Once you 've adjusted to a less materialistic lifestyle , it really gives you more freedom to do more . Both because you have more money to DO things with and less things to take care of . Thailand is also great because of the peaceful and laid back attitude surrounding you . Its just easier to relax here ! <p> Thanks for sharing your insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything is overpriced . Living an expensive place means that you have to be a work slave . And I really do n't  like being forced to do something that I do n't  love just because the rent is high . <p> That 's why I left London last week to go travel in Asia and hopefully be able to live as a freelancer and building a webproject I always wanted to . <p> I will keep reading your blog and get some inspiration for another kind of lifestyle ! : D <p> Isnt it crazy how expensive some things are back in the states ? I 'm loving this cool weather we 've had the past few months . I have n't even had to use the fan at all . My last months electric was around 300 baht ( $10 ) ! <p> Yea , I think it has been about 3 months now of no fan or aircon for us .

One thing I have noticed is that many of your blog visitors are from the USA but because I live in Cape Town South Africa , I can not compare prices .

It looks like the trip is going to cost about 2/3 what we anticipated ( and that includes the deposit we put on Read more + <p> Wow ! That is great Vince . When we first visited Thailand on our honeymoon we were blown away by how HARD it was to spend our daily budget . So happy to hear that you both are loving this wonderful place . We are looking forward to many more great dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time here ! <p> I know ! It is mind blowing that we ever thought it was ok to spend that kind of money on bills . Plus having carried so much debt back in those days we were also paying hundreds in credit card payments . So glad those days are behind us : ) <p> Young people these days , people have to be creative . It is hard for young generation to have a good life here in us . I 'm a good saver and over 50 , pretty well to do even in us , but I want to be pampered in chiang mai very soon . Love your blog . <p> Very informative Thailand is much cheaper than the US and Aus but given how much you pay , does n't  Thailand also reflect a lower income ? SO you might be saving all of that but you are n't  necessarily getting paid the same as you were in the US ? <p> Very true , and that is a really important point . Living in Thailand has also been a lifestyle change for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between debt and no time off we just could n't fully enjoy it . We definitely think Chiang Mai is a wonderful place to retire on a fixed pension or for those looking to simplify the way they live . It is all relative . <p> Hey guys ! I can imagine living in Thailand is my dream my one day ! I guess it depends on what 's important to you having a nice house and pretty things around you but working your ass off 24/7 or being able to relax a little and enjoy life <p> Exactly ! The things in our lives back home that we always thought we needed to be happy soon became our anchors . We felt such a big weight lifted when we started to sell them and pay off our debts . Making less and being financially free totally works for us . We appreciate and enjoy everything around us so much these days . Thanks for the love , Sam ! <p> Oh wow !

@@59574566 @8574566/ <h> Funny and Embarrassing Thai Massage Stories <p> One of the perks of living in Thailand is the accessibility to affordable massages . We 've had our fair share of both good and bad massages in Thailand , but every once in a while well have a funny or surprising thing happen during our hour of supposed bliss . Heres a- collection- of short stories for your entertainment : <p> Massages in Thailand are pretty dang awesome and- range from luxurious treatments at professional spas to no-frills massages at quaint roadside parlors . We tend to go for the latter and pay between 150 to 300 baht- for an hour massage and leave a little extra for tip . <p> We 've had really good massages that have put us to sleep . Others have been unmemorable and a few not so good . Once we were subjected to an hour long massage of painful leg hair pulling ( for Chris ) and- excessive shin bone rubbing ( for me ) , but we were too embarrassed for our masseuses to tell them- to stop ! But- boy- do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday , Chris treated me to a full day of massages . We ended up going to three different places , one of which was a high-end spa where we splurged on a- package featuring a body scrub , foot massage , and an oil massage . <p> We shared a fancy room that had two massage tables , a shower in one corner , and a soaking tub in another . We were asked to undress and- put on- plastic shower caps ( how sexy ) and these itty bitty black pairs of disposable underwear before crawling under our sheets on the massage beds . <p> Our body scrub came first . When it was finished , instead of- being wiped down- with a cool damp cloth as expected , we were asked to clean off in the- shower . The awkward part was that both masseuses remained- in the room . <p> Rinsing off would n't have been so bad if the enclosed shower actually offered privacy . Although the- bottom half was frosted glass , the top half was completely clear . There 's nothing like sporting your- birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After cleaning up , we put on a second yet equally ridiculous pair of disposable underwear , crawled back under the- sheets , and got a foot massage followed by a full body oil massage . <p> When everything was- over , the masseuses left the room and finally allowed us to change in privacy . That 's when I looked over at Chris and realized that the black disposable underwear he was- wearing were- completely and utterly see-through. - His pair had stretched much more on him than they had on me and left- nothing to the imagination . He could have been strutting around in his birthday suit as far as I could tell ! <h> Kick Yourself Where ? Massage <p> So this is actually a story that one of our good friends shared with us . He s a professional masseuse and pretty particular about the massages he gets . However , if a massage place has great reviews , hell consider it and treat himself . <p> So he- researched some of the higher-end spas and booked a Thai massage at a place with great- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professional staff ? Check . Calming atmosphere ? Check . Clean and freshly spa scented ? Check . <p> But not long after he had stretched himself on his massage table did things start going down hill . He could tell immediately that his masseuse did n't  know what she was doing . She was contorting him in very odd ways , which says a lot even for a Thai massage . At one point , she managed to bend his leg in a way where he actually kicked himself right in his man parts . Most guys cant- do this even if they tried ! <p> Massages are supposed to be a therapeutic or relaxing experience , not a kick in the balls , pun fully intended . Certainly she couldnt do it- again- because- it takes skill- to get that kind of- leverage on- a full-grown man- and make him kick himself ! - But nope , this woman managed to do it a second time with the other leg . To this day our friend- does n't  know if she was blissfully unaware of the torture or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year my parents and younger sister visited Thailand and one afternoon we stopped at a little massage shop after exploring the town on foot . We requested two oil massages ( for me and my sister ) and two foot massages for my parents . My parents were seated in the front area- of the massage shop and my sister and I were taken to the back . <p> Going to the back of a shop for an oil massage is not unusual , except that the two of us were led to a full-sized mattress to share . This was odd because typically each customer receives their own personal narrow mattress . <p> It was n't a big deal , but then one of the masseuses closed the curtains around the massage area- indicating that we were to undress right there together and not separately in a changing room . Again , a little odd , but nothing I could n't handle . After all , I grew up sharing a room with my sister for 10+ years . <p> An oil massage begins with you laying on your stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . Then you flip over and it- continues on your arms , chest , and the front of your legs , face and head . I 've had one or two masseuses whove massaged my chest muscles , but its pretty rare since I have boobs. - If they do it , they- place a small towel over my chest and then pull down the sheet to work around my pec muscles . <p> But this time there was no small- towel provided for modesty . Nope ! The one time I 'm sharing the same massage space with another person is when I 'm completely topless and getting- my- pecs massaged . It was utterly shameful knowing that my sister was receiving the same treatment just an arms length away- and it was everything I could do to keep my eyes shut and act like this was totally normal . <p> Of course there are embarrassing things that happen in an industry when customers are nearly naked . Which leads me to my last massage story <h> Newbie No Pants- Massage <p> During the last few days my family was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris and I have been to several times . This particular place is set up with several small rooms , each featuring two or three individual- mattresses with- curtain separators in between . <p> Somehow my mom and sister were whisked away to share one room and I was left to share a room with Chris and my dad . This wasnt so bad except that when I wanted to go to the far massage table for a little privacy , therefore putting Chris between me and my dad , my massage lady insisted that I stay in the middle . <p> Ok , alright . I reluctantly pulled the curtains closed around me , got out of my robe , and wiggled under my massage table sheet wearing only my underwear . But my massage lady proceeded to throw- open- the curtains and started my session- without having any privacy between Chris or my dad . <p> Of course I 'm dreading the moment when halfway through the massage I 'd be asked- to flip over on my back . This is where the masseuse lifts up the cloth covering my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment I 'll be completely exposed to either Chris ( ok ) or my dad ( not ok ) . <p> In the middle of this thought I hear my dads masseuse give out a squeal followed by a few ooo-eees ! and Thai chatter . Evidently , this was my dads first full body oil massage and when they instructed him to undress , well , he did . Completely . His masseuse lady- must have been going through the motions of- adjusting the sheet that was draped- over him and was completely caught off guard by his blinding white butt cheeks . <h> Were sure there are a million Thai massage stories <p> This is about the time when I wish I could speak Thai well enough to have my masseuse tell me some massage stories from their point of view. - Do you have any funny or embarrassing Thai massage stories ?

And there have been several occasions that we undress with the masseuse standing nearby ( although its always been the same sex with our backs turned ) .

So that I do n't  feel squeamish , I view it as massaging my pectoral muscles ( just like they would on a guy ) . Its embarrassing when you are n't  expecting it , but its just part of the program and shows how different massages are from back home ( As Americans , if a masseuse touched a womans glutes or pecs , he would be sued for sexual harassment ! ) Its good that other people know about it so that they can tell their masseuse Read more + <p> Hopefully you feel a bit more prepared before your arrival massages can be great but they can be just as goofy !

@@59574569 @8574569/ <h> Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa <p> Traveling to Krabi and looking for an exotic place to stay ? In the nearby beach town of Ao Nang , there is a resort that is nothing short of paradise . Featuring bungalow-styled villas nestled among tropical gardens and sky-high limestone cliffs , the- Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa captures the essence of Thailands natural beauty in design and feel . A two-night stay here for around $45 USD per night had us wanting to stay for an entire month . <p> The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa is home to about two dozen two-story villas clustered among tropical foliage with a gorgeous view of the nearby cliff formation . Set a little back from the main road ( Route 4203 ) that runs through Ao Nang , this oasis is clean , quiet , and private , and provides guests with a relaxing oasis from which they can easily access the gorgeous beaches nearby . <h> Superior Double <p> The villas are composed of four separate units , each with their own entrance ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main room showcases natural wood floors and stone accents , and has simple Thai silk and bamboo decorations . The king-size bed is very comfortable and topped with a fluffy duvet . <p> Branching off from the main room is a small luggage area with a sitting bench and a rack to hang clothes . We though it was refreshing to have a separate area to store luggage . Each bungalow is also equipped with air conditioning . <h> Bathroom <p> The bathroom has an earthy design , complete with a ceramic sink , stone floor shower , and a homemade wooden lock . Linens , shampoo , conditioner , and body wash are provided . The water gets really hot and has excellent pressure . The deluxe room even has a tub . <h> Pool and Spa <p> In the center of the Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa , situated among the lush flowers and mature trees , is a pool . Although each villa can conveniently access the pool , the swimming and sunbathing area still maintains a level of privacy provided by the jungle entwined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area as well as a nearby shower station and bathrooms . <p> There are a good number of comfortable and over-sized lounge chairs on the pool deck . However , this seemed to be a popular hangout place for guests so arrive early if you want a spot ! <p> There is also a poolside bar and several tables to enjoy adult beverages and fruit smoothies . About a half a dozen tables are available if you want to be outside in the shade with a poolside view . <p> The spa includes a large sauna and massage room . The massage services are provided in an air-conditioned massage room that is clean and relaxing , with beds separated by nice white curtains . We were able to make spa appointments by simply calling the front desk . If you would like a specific time , be sure to make reservations prior to arriving at the resort . <h> Breakfast <p> There 's an on-site restaurant at the Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa that serves breakfast from 7am to 10am . There is mostly Western food , including pancakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beans , ham , and yogurt . There is also a good variety of fresh cut fruit available , as well as water , orange juice , milk , instant coffee , and tea . <p> Breakfast was decent , but the convenience of it is worth paying for because the resort is a bit far from any breakfast shops . The breakfast package is optional ( roughly 350 baht extra per room ) and can be chosen during booking . <h> Free Shuttle To and From the Beach <p> The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa is 1.5 kms from downtown Ao Nang and the beach area , which takes about 20 minutes to walk . However , there is a free shuttle service for guests scheduled for various pickup times every day . The earliest drop off is 10:00 am and the last pickup is at 10:10 pm , with runs about every two hours . The ride is in the back of a white songthaew that is complete with natural wood interior and fun interior lights . <p> Typically a tuk-tuk ride this far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a free alternative ! <h> Service <p> We stayed in a ground level room near the front of the resort . Even though the front desk was a short distance away , the flow of guests coming and going did not bother us . Additionally , although we arrived a bit early , the staff was able to accommodate us and have our room ready in about 15 minutes . <p> The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa provides a private van to pick up guests from the Krabi International Airport . For our group of five , this service was an affordable option , costing us 800 baht each way . Alternatives provided directly by the airport include a private shuttle service ( 800 to 1200 baht ) or a public bus ( 150 baht per person ) that will take you to your hotel or guesthouse . <h> Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa Amenities <p> On-site Restaurant ; Optional Inclusive Breakfast <p> Free Shuttle Service To and From Beach <p> On-site Pool with Poolside Bar <p> On-site Fitness Center and Sauna Spa with Massage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridge in Rooms <p> Excellent WiFi with Desk Area in Rooms <p> King Size Bed ; Additional Bed Available on Request <p> Free Tea , Instant Coffee , and Water <h> Suggestions <p> There were only two outlets in the room . We recommend bring a three prong adapter if you plan on using a computer . Better yet , bring a mufti-outlet adapter if you need to do more than just charge your phone . <p> Unless you are a late riser or normally skip breakfast , we recommend purchasing the breakfast package offered by the resort . The first shuttle to town does n't  leaves until 10am , and there are n't  any nearby dining options . <h> Overall Stay <p> The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa went above and beyond satisfying our needs for a relaxing and exotic stay near one of Thailands tropical beaches . It offers privacy when needed , but is not too far from the Ao Nang downtown area , which has plenty of things to do . When we vacation in Krabi , we will be sure to come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a romantic getaway ! I like how the place is integrated into the landscape . While the room prices are n't  high by American standards , they are a bit shocking compared to Chiang Mai eh ? " : - ) <p> We loved our stay there . There are actually plenty of places in Chiang Mai that raise their prices during high-season , and some are just plain expensive all year . Whenever you start venturing toward the beaches or Bangkok prices start to rise . There are plenty of hostels and budget hotels in Krabi , but we were looking to treat ourselves a bit this time : ) It would be smart to visit around October to get the best bang for your buck . Hotels on the beach are usually selling rooms for half price around that time . 161248 @qwx571248

So wheres a cool place to go when were looking for a fun , cheap , and entertaining afternoon ? Its called Huay Tung Tao Lake , and its only about a twenty-minute drive northwest of the Old City . <p> Chiang Mai is awesome , but one of the downsides is that its nowhere near a beach . Last year we found out about Huay Tung Tao Lake and have since visited it several times . So when our good friends Rachel and Adam were passing through- town on their- round Southeast- Asia trip , we knew we had to take them there . <h> Hiking , Biking , and Swimming at- Huay Tung Tao Lake <p> The view at Huay Tung Tao Lake is stunning . The still- waters are backed by nearby mountains and the lake is lined with picturesque grass huts . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take a tour of the- lake . <p> Kids and college students play in the water fully clothed. - Thai families relax in the little picnic huts and enjoy platters of food and cold beverages. - The paved road around the lake offers a shady route for people to walk or ride their bikes . <p> More than likely , you 'll be the only foreign face there . <h> Lakeside Restaurants <p> There are about twenty restaurants surrounding the lake that serve food- and drinks in a picnic-like setting . Guests- can enjoy food in the little huts made of bamboo and wild grasses , complete with shade and a cool cross breeze over the lake . <p> Weve gone to Huay Tung Tao Lake four or five- times now and always go to Restaurant #2 . Why ? Its always been- delicious and the bathrooms are close ! <p> The restaurants- menus are written in both Thai and English . However , the staff does n't  speak much English , so pointing and holding up fingers is the way to order if you do n't  speak restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Weve gotten whole fish , steamed and fried , for 180 baht or about 6 USD . <p> Vendors- walk around the lake selling snacks for 20 baht per packet or three packets for 50 baht . They offer fresh cut fruit , boiled peanuts , spicy nuts , squid sticks , and even fried bugs . There are also ice cream carts that slowly make their way around to each table selling cold goodies . <p> TIP : - Huay Tung Tao Lake is popular place- on weekends , so visiting on weekdays or arriving early is your best bet for securing a table . Groups up to six people can sit comfortably at one table . <h> Cost of an Afternoon Lounging at Huay Tung Tao Lake <p> The total damage for an afternoon at Huay Tung Tao Lake was- just shy of 2,000 baht or about 330 baht ( 10 USD ) per person for food and drinks. - <p> This included two large bottles of the local rum with accompanying ice and soda water . We ordered two whole fish , two large platters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catfish salad , and papaya- salad . We also grabbed some snacks from the local vendors . <h> How to Get to the Lake <p> Our first trip to Huay Tung Tao Lake was with six people . We shared- a songthaew ride from the Old City . Our driver took us there , waited for three or three and a half hours , and then drove us back for 600 baht ( 18 USD ) .

A : A Bluebird account is a free bank account online from American Express that does n't  charge maintenance fees . You can transfer money to and from your accounts with other banking institutions , quickly transfer money to friends , set it up for deposit , and more . <p> Q:Ok , but what makes Bluebird different from my current bank account ?

A : Yes , absolutely , but do you earn miles or points when you pay these bills using your current bank account ? Of course not , and this is where the Vanilla Reload cards come into play . <h> Vanilla Reload Card : <p> Once on the Vanilla Reload website enter your Bluebird card number in the top line , and the pin from the back of the Vanilla Reload card in the bottom Line <p> Q:What is a Vanilla Reload Card ? A : A Vanilla Reload Card is sort of like a gift card , but one that can be purchased with your rewards credit card and then loaded into your Bluebird account . Once these funds are transferred into your Bluebird account , you can spend them just like cash . <p> Q:What is the benefit ? A : You can now pay your high dollar monthly bills using your rewards credit card ! <p> Q : - What makes this so special ? A : The big kicker here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card , load them into your Bluebird account , transfer those funds into your current bank account , and then pay off the credit card you just used to buy the Vanilla Reload cards . <p> Q:Wait , how much is this going to cost me ? A : - Like we said , not much at all . Each Vanilla Reload card can be purchased for $3.95 with a maximum allowable load of $500 per card ( minimum of $20 ) . This means you can easily meet any minimum spend amount required to earn that big miles bonus and spend next to nothing doing so . <h> Earning Miles with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload Cards Changes the Game <p> Think about it for a secondthis method beats the heck out of having to wait months that you may not have trying to meet minimum spends on two or three rewards cards . <p> Imagine how long it took you before to earn those spending requirements on your rewards credit cards .

If you plan to travel with a significant other , friend , or family member , then do them a huge favor and share this article with them . <h> Limits on Earning Miles with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload Cards <p> According to the Bluebird website , the maximum amount of funds you can add to your account via cash funding sources such as Vanilla Reload cards is $1,000 on a day and $5,000 a month . When wed go out and purchase our Vanilla Reload cards , we 'd buy the max amount .

Simply transfer any Vanilla Reload funds out of your Bluebird account before the month ends to free up space and continue earning miles with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload cards ! <h> Where Can I Buy Vanilla Reload Cards ? <p> Earning miles with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload cards can be a bit of work if you do n't  know where to buy the Vanilla Reloads , so based on our experience here 's a few establishments that should be happy to sell them to youif they 're in stock ! <p> CVS Our go-to place for buying Vanilla Reload cards .

Now , this does n't  change the fact that you cant load more than $1,000 a day into your Bluebird account from third-party sources . However , it does mean you no longer have to make five trips to CVS every month ! <p> 7-11 As of late , people online have reported that they were able to now purchase Vanilla Reload cards with their rewards credit cards at 7-11 stores . <p> Office Depot We had no luck with Office Depot , but Bluebird account holders online say otherwise . When we lived in Virginia , the Office Depot stores never seemed to restock their card inventory often enough for us to consider them a reliable place to purchase them . <p> If you do n't  have any of these stores near you then check out this full list of stores- you can use to begin earning miles without Bluebird and Vanilla Reload cards . <p> Make sure that you buy the card that is pictured above . It is not the shape of a credit card . <p> Also , be prepared to deal with human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  think we could purchase Vanilla Reload cards with our credit cards . Whenever this happened , we asked for a manager and they usually set their employee straight . If the issue persists , just politely let them know that you have done this before and that you 'll be taking your business to another location . <p> Instructions and the scratch off code is on the back of the card <h> Pros and Cons <p> As stated before , earning miles with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload cards is usually really simple . It helps you surpass those minimum spend requirements faster than traditional spending , and it creates an environment for everyone to have some skin in the miles earning game . Additional pros are : <p> Free ATM withdrawals at MoneyPass ATMs <p> No foreign transaction fees <p> No inactivity fees <p> No overdraft fees <p> No card replacement fees <p> Unfortunately , there are some cons , but if you use your Bluebird account strictly for paying bills and buying Vanilla Reload cards all of them are avoidable : <p> $2 withdrawal/decline fee on non-MoneyPass ATMs <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawals <p> Transfers to and from other banking institutions takes two to three days , but my first transaction took almost a full week to process . <h> Verdict on Earning Miles With Bluebird and Vanilla Reload Cards <p> Again , we never used our Bluebird accounts for anything other than earning miles and points to pad our rewards accounts . It was simply used as a workhorse to buy miles bonuses at an extremely cheap rate . If you stick to using it as we did then you should be able to reap all its amazing benefits . <p> What are you waiting for ?

A little more hassle but still worth it . <p> Chris and Angela thank you so much for the article ! Wonderful job explaining the steps . Do either of you know what type of rewards credit card would give mile rewards when using it to make purchases at CVS/groceries ? Or what rewards credit card would you recommend to get miles with ? <p> Great question ! We personally signed up for Southwest Premier , Southwest Plus , Chase Sapphire , and Capital One Venture Visa Cards to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  matter what or where we made a purchase . We kept a lookout for offers in the mail and looked at various companies online . When they offered a good deal ( 25,000+ points ) , that 's when we jumped on it ! <p> Hello I must be slow or something I have read both bluebird and vanellia web sites and I do n't  see anything about free air miles So I 'm having trouble understanding why you would use these services Can you explain how this works I do n't  have a rewards card and if I apply and get one why not just use it to pay all my monthly bills and earn miles that way ? And pay that card off each month out of my bank account I am interested because my wife and I are planning to move to Central America next spring Read more + <p> Tim , I have added the below steps to the post for people that may not fully understand the process . Your personal airline rewards credit card is not affiliated with bluebird or vanilla reload card so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why we have provided here ) . Vanilla and Bluebird are only a vessel for you to earn miles/reward without REALLY spending any money .

If you get sign up for a rewards card soon use the Bluebird and Vanilla Reload cards to quickly earn miles , before you know it you 'll have a free flight . It is worth trying it out ! <p> Am I missing something here ? At $3.95 a $1000/reload , it would cost me $12-16/month to pay all my bills . That 's $144-$192/year to get $36-48000 credits . How much does it take to get a free international flight nowadays ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term installment plan , but what if they cancel it on you in a few years before you 've redeemed ? <p> Keith , We definitely do not recommend using this to get miles on purely a 1 for 1 basis . However , what we recommended in the article is using the reload cards to meet minimum spend requirements in order to capitalize on big bonuses by only spending say $16-$40 , rather than $2,000 to $5,000 if you are n't  typically a big spender . This is also convenient for people trying to meet a certain miles threshold in order to reach certain flyer status or additional airline perks . Hope this clarifies this for you a bit more . Good luck . <p> Chris and Angela : Another great and informative article . Thanks not only for the research , but especially for the thorough and concise articulation of the information . I will be dropping by my local CVS here in Los Angeles today to get started with Bluebird and Vanilla Reload . I will also forward this article to some family and friends . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully photographed . . . but , both it and you are also extremely helpful and intelligent , Have another great day in Thailand . <p> I like how you broke this down . I 've read about it on some other sites , but always felt like a step or two was missing . Thanks for fully explaining it . Off to finally get points for paying our mortgage ! <p> Thanks for letting us know your thoughts ! The opportunity for earning points with bluebird and the vanilla reload cards is just way too good to be true . The fact that its so easy really should be the only reason perspective world travelers should need to go and start earning as many as they can for themselves ( before it goes away one day ) . There has n't  been anything much more rewarding then to get on a plane halfway around the world know it is costing you next to nothing . Makes those long flying hours much more bearable : ) 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 10 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

Those who are interested in doing a border run from Chiang Mai , Chiang Rai , or other large towns in Northern Thailand often go to the land crossings at Mae Sai Tachileik , Myanmar or Nong Khai Vientiane , Laos . But the land crossing at Chiang Khong Huay Xai , Laos was quick and painless and our favorite of the three options . <h> Border Run : Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong-Huay Xai <p> Many people cross from Chiang Khong , Thailand to Huay Xai , Laos ( pronounced hoo-eye sai ) when traveling one-way from Northern Thailand to Luang Prabang , a popular UNESCO World Heritage Site . However , tourists and expats can also use this spot for border runs : to leave Thailand , hop over to a neighboring country , and come back into Thailand to extend their stay . <p> SNAPSHOTClick the links below to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the border run to Chiang Khong is important because there was a time that the nearby Mae Sai border crossing heavily restricted people who could use it . Border officials only allowed people with Multiple Entry Thai Visas ( Tourist and Non Immigrant ) to re-enter Thailand . It used to be that you were SOL if you wanted a Visa Exempt Stamp or a Visa on Arrival . <p> Chiang Khong- Huay Xai border crossing allows people to leave and re-enter Thailand who are activating a new entry on their Multiple Entry Visa , applying for a Visa On Arrival , and eligible for a Visa Exempt Stamp . <h> Who can do a border run to Chiang Khong ? <p> Not everyone can do a border run between Chiang Khong , Thailand and Huay Xai , Laos. - It depends on your citizenship . <p> Tourists and expats who can use the Chiang Khong " Huay Xai border crossing ( to enter Laos and return to Thailand ) , must : <p> As of January 2017 , all Thai Visa Exempt Stamp recipients will receive a- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visa Exempt Stamps , although this could change in the future . <p> When crossing by land , you can only receive- two 30-day Visa Exempt Stamps per calendar year .

However , immigration officials may start to question your motives after you 've received several in a row . <h> Chiang Khong-Huay Xai is a border run , - NOT- a visa run . <p> The Chiang Khong " Huay Xai border crossing is the place to go for a border run and not a visa run . <p> What 's the difference ? <p> A border run ( or border bounce ) is , quite literally , a run to the border .

It departs every 10 to 15 minutes or whenever it is full . You 'll know you 're on the right bus because Bokeo- Chiang Khong Chiang Rai is- written on the side . <p> The fee for the bus varies by time of day . Tickets cost 20 THB per person during normal business hours ( 8am to 12pm , 1pm to 4:30pm ) and 25 THB per person during off hours ( 6:30am to 8am , 12pm to 1pm , and 4:30pm to 6pm ) .

Its near the northern point of Thailand about 1.5 hrs from the Golden Triangle . This bridge spans the Mekong River that separates Thailand from Laos and is roughly 10 kilometers south of the central part of Chiang Khong town . <p> It used to be that travelers had to take the ferry across the river to do a border run . The old immigration office is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge . Although this ferry still runs today , it only services Thai and Laos citizens . <h> Getting from Chiang Mai to the Chiang Khong Land Crossing <p> There are a few ways to get to the Chiang Khong border crossing . Options include driving yourself , hiring a private border run van service to take you directly to the border and back to home , or taking a public transportation such as a bus to Chiang Khong and then a- tuk-tuk or songthaew to the border . <h> By Car or Motorbike <p> We chose to rent a car and drove ourselves from Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong . It took roughly 5 hours . We parked our car in a parking lot about 50 meters or so away from the Chiang Khong Immigration Building , did our border run , and then came back to our car when we were finished . <h> Private Border Run Service to Chiang Khong <p> It is possible to use a border run service from some of the major towns in northern Thailand . A driver will typically pick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drive to the border , get everyone to cross into Laos and back into Thailand , and then drive back to your home in the evening . One company that offers this service is AYA Service . <h> Public Bus to Chiang Khong <p> Another option is to take a bus from your originating town 's bus station to the Chiang Khong Bus Station . From there you can take a tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Chiang Khong Immigration Office . Keep in mind that you 'll have to spend at least one night in Chiang Khong because buses only depart in the morning . <p> There has been talk about the Thai authorities becoming more strict on the number of times a person can enter the country on a non-immigrant visa . Supposedly , people have been turned away at the border and refused entry . Is this really an issue and something that is a cause for worry ? Thanks ! <p> We have n't heard anything like that at all . Several consecutive tourist visas or visa exempt stamps will definitely raise red flags , but non-immigrant visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a re-entry permit if you 're on a single entry visa . <p> Love the clarity and detail in this post . Thanks . Nice to know that we can get 30-days by land as well . Did n't  know about this option before . There 's so much confusing information out there in the various forums about how many visa exempts or tourist visas one can get , etc . Thank you for clarifying that too . <p> Very well written , thank you so much for doing this , i really enjoy reading your blog . After so many years in Thailand , do you still enjoy staying there ? Or is there another country you would like to move to ? <p> Thanks , Vladi . Hopefully it helps everyone who had questions about this particular border crossing . We still love Thailand . Although from time to time we 've talked about moving to another country say , somewhere in South America or Europe but were so comfortable here that well be staying for awhile ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 9 days 11 hours ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574578 @8574578/ <h> A Trip to the Chiang Dao Nest in Northern Thailand <p> If you 've spent some time in Northern Thailand , chances are you 've heard whispers about a place called the Chiang Dao Nest . Its in a small town in the Chiang Mai province and its actually two sister resorts less than 1km from each another . We say treat yourself to either the Nest 1 or Nest 2 when you have a long weekend to spare to relaxing and indulging in gourmet food . But that begs the question : Which one do you choose ? <h> Nest 1 <p> Nest 1 has a close-knit cozy community feel to it . It is almost fairytale-like : the bamboo cabins , gazebo lounge areas , and restaurant are loosely contained by a handmade fence within a foresty area , although the sleeping and communal areas are roughly separated from one another by towering trees and lush bushes . <p> Loose stone walkways snake their way around the grounds and link everything together with a series of crisscrossing trails . Scattered around the property are terracotta mushrooms lamps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a few moments , we felt ourselves stepping into a scene from Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream as we were led to our rooms . <p> There are even two resident goats that happily groom the propertys bushes and grass . <p> There are Double and Twin Cabins and Family Suites , but we stayed in the smaller of the two accommodations at Nest 1 . We walked up a few steps to a small front porch and into our cabin with a bedroom and en suite bathroom . <p> It was simply decorated by the local hill tribes handmade goods , woven bamboo wall panels , and soft linen curtains . <p> Walking back to the communal area , there are several lounge areas within a stones throw of one another that have plush couches , long stretches of Thai-style triangular pillows and meditation cushions , mesh hammocks , and Papasan chairs . In other words , the Nest 1 consciously encourages their guests to relax during their time here . Not a bad thing if you ask us ! <p> Near the entrance of The Nest 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather and softly chat on chilly nights , which is pretty common in Chiang Daos cool misty mountains . <p> Across the moss-covered stone terrace is a dining area decorated with strings of bells , fresh flowers on every table , and a hand written specials menu board . <p> But perhaps the star of the show , and what most obviously differentiates Nest 1 most from Nest 2 , is its award-winning restaurant featuring European cuisine . And its open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ! <p> We were hooked after one look at the specials menu and as it turned out , ordered most of our meals exclusively from those boards . We realized that we sorely missed the familiar Western flavors , cuts of meat , baked goods , and cooking styles . <p> But words do n't  do the food justice . The presentations were beautiful , the meat and seafood were perfectly tender , and the portion sizes quite liberal . Foods were stacked , sauces were drizzle , and condiments were carved in ways that we have come to rarely expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garlic Chicken Quesadilla with Nam Prik Noum <p> Small details like leather-bound menus , pitchers of iced water , and a small dish of Himalayan sea salt were thoughtful touches . The next morning the European style breakfast had us drooling over the melted cheddar cheese , hot rolls and butter , fresh espresso , and real bacon . ( If you 've ever traveled in Thailand you know its hard to come by ! ) <p> As far as pricing goes , lunch averaged between 150 and 200 baht ( $5 to $7 USD ) per meal and dinner hovered around 350 baht ( $10 USD ) per meal . Well worth a trip to these quiet mountains ! <p> Depending on the time of year , the Double and Twin Cabins ( sleeps two ) range from 695 to 1095 baht per night ( $20 to $32 USD ) ; Family Suites ( sleeps four ) range from 1145 to 1845 baht ( $33 to $53 USD ) per night . These prices exclude the holiday pricing for Songkran , Christmas , and New Years . <p> Nest 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowering bushes and banana trees and the cabins are generously spaced apart . There is also a spectacular view of the towering mountain . <p> Even the restaurant , which is raised slightly above the rest of the grounds , has unhindered views of the surrounding grounds . <p> There are Cabins and the Family Suite , but we stayed in the larger of the two at Nest 2 . Its a villa with two bedrooms , two bathrooms , and a living room space . <p> It had ample windows that let in natural light and air-conditioning units to keep the place cool . It also came with couches and a bean bag chair ( ! ) , a flat screen TV , mini fridge , hot water pot , and drinks and snacks ( for a small fee ) . <p> Nest 2 is the newer of the two resorts and its noticeable in the smaller details such as the number of outlets and the bathrooms style , but both cabins were clean , fresh smelling , and very comfortable . <p> Very rarely do we indulge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 truly showcases some fine cuisine . There are Thai options for lunch and dinner and a mix of Thai and Western options for breakfast . <p> Aside from the fantastic presentations " stacks of golden fried morning glory vines , bite sized skewers of corn fritters , and steaming clay pots brimming with buffalo curry and shrimp with rice soup " the flavors were rich and savory . It was not difficult to clear our plates completely , even though our stomachs protested . <p> Green Curry Fried Rice SomTum Corn Fritters Buffalo Panang Curry <p> At one point we went a little overboard with the chilies and ordered a dish " Thai spicy . " It turned out our heat preference is more suited for the medium to Farang spicy range , but we were happy to see that the chef was n't afraid to pile on the chilies ! <p> The cost of lunch is around 125 baht ( $3.50 USD ) and dinner prices ranged from 175 to 200 baht ( $5 to $6 USD ) per meal . <p> Depending on the season , the Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1095 baht per night ( $20 to $32 USD ) ; Family Suites ( sleeps four ) range from 1645 to 2995 baht ( $47 to $85 USD ) per night . These prices exclude the holiday pricing for Songkran , Christmas , and New Years . <p> While the restaurant prices at Nest 1 were slightly more than Nest 2 , the price differences are trivial . And although the family suites are more expensive at Nest 2 , they are also fairly newer . We recommend choosing Nest 1 or Nest 2 based on your preference in atmosphere and cuisine and not the price tag . <p> But if we could only choose one ? We think we 'd go with Nest 2 . We were so impressed with the combination of the authentic flavors of Thai food ( with the Thai chefs personal touches ) , beautiful outdoor setting , friendly service , and the very affordable prices . We have been hard pressed to come across all four conditions elsewhere . <p> In fact , were already looking forward to our next trip there , sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment we arrived to the time we were saying our goodbyes , the service at both Nest 1 and Nest 2 was incredibly attentive and friendly . <p> Both resorts welcomed us with refreshing lemongrass drinks and offered cold bottle water and sweet snacks as a departing gift . The staff took care of us without being cloying , which is a blurry line we often run into in Thailand . Not so at either Chiang Dao Nests ! <h> Location and Contact Information of the Chiang Dao Nest 1 &amp; 2 <p> Reservations can be made directly through their website or by contacting them via email . The most affordable time to visit the Chiang Dao Nest is September during the slow rainy season , so youd better go soon ! <p> DISCLOSURE : Our stay at Nest 1 and Nest 2 cabins was sponsored in exchange for an honest review .

@@59574580 @8574580/ <h> Why Travel to Isaan : Thailands Countryside <p> Central Thailand evokes images of a cosmopolitan , sleepless city and Thai temples . Northern Thailand promises cool , green mountains . Southern Thailand wows visitors with gorgeous beaches and islands . But what is Isaan Thailand ? And why should you travel there ? This region is often overlooked by international travelers but that does n't  mean you should n't travel there , especially if you 're the type to seek out adventure and undiscovered places . <p> Our first trip to Isaan ( pronounced ee-sahn ) was just over three years ago . Its a region of Thailand so unlike anywhere else we 've visited before or since . And perhaps because so little is written about it ( at least , in English ) much remains a mystery . <p> We wrote about the overwhelmingly gorgeous Red Lotus Sea but nothing more . At the time , we werent sure how to present our experiences in a way for our readers to follow in our footsteps . After all , most of the activities and places we went to were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is , Isaan Thai ) , which can be daunting for first-time travelers ! <p> Our first trip was an introduction to three provinces : Loei , Udon Thani , and Nong Khai . Later we visited another province called Chaiyaphum with a good Thai friend . There we met her parents and siblings for the first time , participated in a house blessing ceremony , and explored four stunning national parks . <h> Where is Isaan , Thailand ? <p> As we like to say , Isaan is the elephants right ear. Look at the map and you 'll see what we mean . <p> Isaan is in the northeastern region of Thailand . To put it into perspective , Bangkok is in Central Thailand , Chiang Mai is in Northern Thailand , and Phuket is in Southern Thailand . Off to the right is Isaan . <p> It is arguably the least traveled region of Thailand by international travelers . Its a comparatively sleepy area to the countrys other regions , too . But many of our Thai friends and acquaintances are from Isaan Thailand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ubon Ratchathani , and Korat ) are particularly popular with expats , too . <p> Its true that many visiting foreigners simply pass through this region , onward to more functional or arguably more exciting endeavors . Many fly into Udon Thani only to quickly continue to Vientiane , Laos for a visa run . Others go to Luang Prabang ( also in Laos ) , which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site situated on the Mekong River . Its appeal to tourists is snapping the perfect photo of monks collecting alms as the sun rises . <h> Getting there : Buses , trains , and planes <p> Isaan is regularly serviced by trains and buses from other regions of Thailand . The network is complex and goes all over the place but the long road trips take some getting used to . If you want to visit small towns or villages , expect for a private driver take you there or have someone pick you up . <p> You may even ride on a tractor , like this guy . <p> Then there are the local train lines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main arteries : one branching northward through Udon Thani and ending at Nong Khai near the Laos border , the other one snaking eastward to Ubon Ratchathani , which is equidistant from Cambodias northern border and Laoss southwest border . <p> Bus routes come from major cities such as Chiang Mais Arcade Bus Station and Bangkoks Mo Chit ( Northeastern ) Bus Terminal . For those who prefer to fly , the Udon Thani Airport services most Thai airlines from major cities including the budget-friendly AirAsia and Nok Air . <p> It does help to be able to read and speak a little Thai while traveling in Isaan " at least to recognize the towns names . Bus and train tickets are usually purchased in person with cash a few days in advance up to the day of travel . More recently , there are sites like 12go.asia that allow visitors to reserve tickets online ( in English ! ) and pay with the convenience of a debit or credit card . <h> Geography <p> Isaan Thailand is flatter than the mountainous region of Northern Thailand . It does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its land-locked state there are no beaches . Instead , you can expect to see long stretches of rice , corn , pineapple , and taro fields .

In Thailands touristy cities , our foreign faces blended in with thousands of other international travelers and expats . But in Isaan , we were very often the only foreigners visiting a restaurant , hotel , or site , which prompted curious looks from the locals . <p> This seemed especially true for the blonde-haired , blue-eyed Angela . Or perhaps its a novelty that a youngish female was traveling through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see American , European , and other Asian men living as expats in this part of Thailand . <p> Angela was regularly an object of wonder in the smaller towns and especially the villages . We have since lost our collection of photos of our encounters , but one favorite moment happened in the quaint streets of Chiang Khan , Loei . A paparazzi-like swarm of school girls surrounded Angela and asked to take photos posing with her . I stood from a distance and snapped a few photos of the event . <p> There have been other moments where Angelas been singled out by older Thai women to help with making wax flower decorations ( educational ) or a join in a group dance ( quite embarrassing for her , but entertaining for me . ) <h> Regional Cuisine <p> Isaan travel guides indicate that there are restaurants serving a good mix of Western and Thai in the major cities . Udon Thani has a large Vietnamese community thanks to the influx of refugees from the Vietnam-American War . <p> We also noticed a distinct difference in the Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat such as intestines , blood , lots of in-bone stewed pieces.There are sour sauces , bitter herbs , and very pungent fish pastes " which , try as we might , did not enjoy that much . <p> But since that visit , we realize that many of the foods we have come to love are from Isaan . Grilled pork neck ( kaw moo yahng ) , papaya salad ( som tom ) , Isaan sour sausage ( sai grok ) and minced meat salad ( laab ) , to name a few . <h> More about Isaan <p> Weve written a series of posts that share our stories of travels to Isaan years ago . Specifically , it highlights the amazing places we visited in Loei and Udon Thani ( the Red Lotus Sea in particular ) , and Nong Khai .

@@59574581 @8574581/ <h> Pak Khlong Talat Market in Bangkok <p> Pak Khlong Talat is a market in Bangkok well known for its wholesale flowers . However , little is written about the volumes of fresh fruits and vegetables on which Pak Khlong Talat- was once established during its reign as Bangkoks largest bulk produce- market . During an early Sunday morning visit , we explored one of the most impressive displays of fresh produce that we 've ever come across . A big thank you to our friend , Mick Shippen , for the private tour ! <p> UPDATE : - The Pak Khlong , Yodpiman Flower , and Song Serm Kaset Markets served their last customers on- 29 February 2016 . Vendors have since moved or closed their businesses. - <h> Sprawling Wholesale Produce Market <p> The Pak Khlong Talat is a wholesale produce market , evident by its massive displays of fruit and vegetables . There are woven baskets the size of wine barrels that are home to shredded ginger , chilies , and oranges ; bundles of lemongrass and asparagus barely able to fit under one 's arm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer volume of produce is incredible ! <p> There is a lot of movement with the produce itself . Hand carts , stacked six or eight feet tall with bags and baskets , can be regularly spotted being wheeled through the narrow streets . These goods are on their way to be delivered to other markets or to restaurants . <p> Beautiful and rugged , huge displays of fresh fruit and vegetables stretch on and on throughout the market . Nearly perfect fruit are laid out in repeating rows for potential buyers. - The variety is never ending . <p> Some displays werent the table set-ups we usually see . The market seems to spill from two- and three-story shop-houses embedded along the narrow market streets . Garage entranceways serve as areas to temporarily stage stacks of fresh produce . <h> An Authentic Thai Market in Bangkok <p> What makes the Pak Khlong Talat market memorable and different from other markets we 've visited is the quiet calmness it evokes . It is quite large ( several sois wide ) and because it is in Bangkok , we expected it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike . <p> Instead , early on a Sunday morning , there were only a few people shopping , and the small-scale produce vendors were meandering to neighboring stalls instead of busily making sales . This is because the Pak Khlong Talat market really comes alive very late at night until very early in the morning , just as the flower , fruit , and produce shipments from the surrounding regions of Thailand are delivered . <p> The local sellers were eager to chat with us . Currently this morning produce market is n't a hotspot for tourists , but that could change in the near future . According to one lady selling several varieties of leafy greens , a large outdoor riverfront- mall is being built that will certainly attract crowds to the market area . <h> Yodpiman Flower Market <p> Adjacent to the Pak Khlong Talat market is the Yodpiman Flower Market . Here there are vendors selling fresh bundles of wholesale flowers as well as skillfully crafted garlands , wreaths , and bouquets. - Walking through has a light smell of jasmine , a popular flower used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pak Khlong Talat Market <p> The Pak Khlong Talat Market ( and the Yodpiman Flower Market ) are accessible both by roadway and waterway . They are located on the east bank of the Chao Phraya River near the base of the dark green Memorial Bridge . <p> This bridge is a recognizable stop for the Chao Phraya water taxis . Look for the- Chao Phraya- Orange Flag Express Boat , which departs from various stations along the river every 10 or 20 minutes , depending on time and day . The orange flag express boat route goes as far south as Wat Rajsingkorn S3 Pier and as far north as Nonthaburi ( Pibui 3 ) N30 Pier . Tickets cost a flat rate of 15 baht per person and are paid for in cash directly to the boat 's staff . <p> The stop for the Pak Khlong Talat Market is the Memorial Bridge N6 Pier . A left turn off of the pier and a short northbound walk will lead you to- the Yodpiman Flower Market and onward- to the Pak Khlong Talat Market . Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat stop by which to also easily access the market . <p> For those taking public transportation , take the skytrain to Saphan Taksin BTS Station . A large flight of stairs exiting the Saphan Taksin stop ends conveniently at the riverside Central Pier . From this water taxi stop , the Pak Khlong Talat Market is just a five minute boat ride away . <p> That looks like a great market ! I have to say that Ive been to Bangkok 5 times now and have not been there . Well have to check it out next time were in town ! There is another market of note that everyone will want to visit and that is the Chatuchak Weekend Market . Its huge ! Somewhere around 35 acres . Has everything you can imagine and is a must see .

Do you cook a lot or mostly dine out ? Ive been trying to cook my own meals when in China and I love to do food shopping at local markets here in Dongguan .

@@59574590 @8574590/ <h> Songkran Expectations Versus Reality <p> Songkran is one of Thailands most popular and coolest festivals . Its up there along with the Running of the Bulls in Spain and the Holi Festival of Colors in India . And while it attracts millions of people from around the world , there are a few things you should know " a little Songkran expectations versus reality , per se " before going to the worlds biggest water fight . <p> We participated in Chiang Mais Songkran when we first moved to Thailand in 2013 . And you know what ? Songkran will forever be the most memorable water fight we 've ever experienced . Water guns , massive hoses , stages with live music and bass- bumping , parades , street food , and people of all ages having a grand time getting each other soaking wet . <p> While undoubtedly fun and unlike any party we 've ever been to , it was also a bit overwhelming and exhausting . We simply werent mentally prepared for Songkrans impressive crowds and intense- energy , so we blindly jumped into craziness up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got caught in a foam party where everything but our eyes was covered in suds ! <h> Driving <p> Expectation- You hop in your car or on your motorbike and drive into town for the big celebration . <p> Reality Believe it or not , vehicles are fun moving targets . Get ready for icy buckets of water and high pressured water hoses aimed in your direction . Have you ever- tried- maintaining control of a motorbike- after being shocked by freezing cold water ? What about after an- explosive splash hits your windshield ? Unfortunately , driving becomes quite dangerous during Songkran and there is a spike in automobile related accidents and even deaths ( no joke ! ) , so be careful ! <p> Tip- Limit your driving- if possible . Between surprise water attacks , slippery roads , and an excessive amount of drunk drivers , its best to find a place to celebrate and stay put so you do n't  become a statistic . <h> Taking Public Transportation <p> Expectation- Theres a chance you 'll be drinking later and do n't  want to drive home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of riding in a- tuk-tuk or songthaew ( red cab trucks ) and sightsee along the way to the big celebration . <p> Reality Unless you use public transportation that can shut its windows and lock its doors , you 'll be a sitting duck . Open-aired tuk-tuks- and- songthaews- stuck in traffic are the perfect target . You will get absolutely soaked , a victim of an uncountable number of bucket dumps in the lap and squirt guns to the face . And bless your soul if you have luggage . Let 's hope your holiday enthusiasm does n't  wear off by the time you get to your final destination ! <p> Tip- Hail an Uber ! - For Uber first-timers , get the app- ( you can get it here ) - and- use our Uber code tielandtothailandsue- to- get 75 THB off your first two trips .

Seriously , it happens ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun is going down . Your lips are blue and you cant feel your toes . Although you 're in a tropical climate , there 's a chance you 're getting- hypothermia . <p> Tip- Take care of yourself . Wear clothes that protect you from the sun , put on sunscreen , and drink ( bottled ) water . Play hard , but not too hard , and change into dry clothes when- you 're finished . <h> Taking Photos and Videos <p> Reality Although you bought a waterproof sealable bag from a roadside vendor , you forgot to close it completely that one time and now your iPhone is dead . Womp womp . <p> Tip- Protect your electronics from water . Better yet , leave your camera or phone at home unless you have a waterproof case . <h> Drinking Adult Beverages <p> Expectation- You join in on an impromptu game of street-side beer pong or cheer your new group of friends as some fruity cocktail gets passed around . <p> Reality Not-so-clean Songkran water got in your- cup , but you drank it anyways . Heck , alcohol kills parasites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're still unable to eat solid foods and finally succumb to going to the clinic for some antibiotics . You humbly use any toilet within reach , even those infamous squat toilets that need a bucket to flush . <p> Tip- Pass on the jungle juice or games of public beer pong to avoid digesting any unwelcomed organisms . Or at the very least , drink from a bottle and cover the opening with your thumb . And it goes without saying to use good judgement when drinking : wet t-shirts and booze are a bad combo and often people think it grants free passes to grope others . <h> Splashing People Appropriately <p> Expectation- You buy a super soaker and a floral shirt for a few bucks and join in on the fun ! <p> Reality You get pummeled because everyone has a super soaker . Although you make an attempt at playful water fights , some people in the crowd go way overboard . Your orifices have never been so violated and you wish you had been smart enough to wear goggles , ear plugs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later you 've developed a serious case of pink eye and an ear infection . You pay more than a few bucks to get these treated at the clinic . <p> Tip- Play nice . Deliberately squirting high pressure water into peoples eyes , ears , nose and mouth is so not cool . And although you cant prevent others from doing this to you , you can protect yourself by wearing goggles and earplugs . Its not sexy , but neither is pink eye . <h> The Magic <p> Whether you have read this in silent disbelief or are nodding your head in agreement- ( because you 've been there , done that ) , Songkran is still magical . <p> Songkran will be the most amazing water fight you 'll ever experience .

Even good quality t-shirts and cargo shorts will do . Packing a pair of semi-casual pants will come in handy for an evening out . <p> Ladies , definitely pack skirts , shorts , summer dresses , and tasteful tops .

We do n't  mean turtlenecks , but your cleavage should n't be showing .

Some free-spirited individuals like to connect with Mother Earth and in some countries its ok ( maybe ? which ones , we do n't  know ) , but not in Thailand . Bringing city grime that 's been collecting on the soles of your feet into a Thai home or business is offensive . <h> Beaches <p> Thailand is famous for its gorgeous beaches , but make sure to cover up appropriately as soon as you 're off the beach ! <h> Do wear bathing suits on the beach and cover-ups in town <p> Although Thais are often fully clothed at the beach , its alright for foreign guys to wear only swim shorts and for ladies to wear two piece bathing suits . Just makes sure this is at the beach and not while you 're walking down Main Street . <p> When you step off the sand and start to venture into town , grab a beach cover-up . Ladies , this means wearing a sarong or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab a t-shirt ( nothing sleeveless ) to wear over your swim trunks . <p> There are tons of shops in Thailands beach towns selling airy cover-ups and wraps . Theyll also have lots of sunglasses and big floppy sun hats to protect you from the sun when you need them . <p> Sarongs are perfect for covering up your bathing suit , drying off , protecting your skin from the sun , and stretching out on the sand.These elephant sarongs are a great fit for Thailands beaches . <h> Do n't  walk around town in bathing suits or go topless <p> A quick glance around and you will never see a Thai person walking down the street or riding a motorbike in a bathing suit . Nor will they ride around barefoot . Wearing a bathing suit into town without a cover-up is a big no no and makes Thais ( and conscientious expats ) uncomfortable . This especially holds true in non-beach towns such as Bangkok and Chiang Mai ! <p> The only area in Thailand we would say to be more conscious about your choice in bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This region is populated by conservatively dressed Muslim communities and its considered disrespectful to walk around with your booty jiggling in a thong bikini or your package , eh hem , on display in a Speedo . There you will see Thais , both men and women , wearing what looks like a wet suit . <h> Temples <p> If there is one place where both men and women must dress appropriately , this is it . Otherwise , you risk offending the locals in their place of worship . <h> Do cover up your shoulders and knees <p> Men are expected to wear conservative collared shirts and shorts that come to the knee , although pants are preferred . T-shirts are ok , but a dressier shirt , whether short-sleeved or long-sleeved , is preferred . <p> Women must cover their cleavage and shoulders and wear pants or skirts that are at least knee-length . One of the best pieces of clothing you can pack is a shawl because you can wrap it around your waist or drape it across your shoulders and chest if you are visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a temple . Monks are highly respected , so keep your head below a monk as you pass by them ( duck a little if you 're tall ) and do not touch them ( especially women ) . <h> Do n't  dress immodestly <p> Men should n't go to a temple in a sleeveless shirt or a shirt that 's been left unbuttoned and revealing their chest or belly . Do n't  walk in with really short shorts , either . <p> Women will not be allowed to go into a temple if their shoulders , thighs , or cleavage is showing . <p> Most of the popular temples provided visitors with free wraps just in case you 've not covered up enough . <h> Fabric Choices <p> Choosing an outfit based on fabric rather than cut is the best way to stay cool and comfortable . <h> Do bring lightweight clothing made of quick-wicking material <p> Natural fabrics such as silk and linen are wonderful to wear in hot climates . Also , some synthetic or semi-synthetic polyester blends are known for being sweat-wicking and quick-drying . They usually stay wrinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best ! Cotton blends are ok , too , as long as the material is thin . <p> Stick with clothing that have darker color shades or patterns . Light or bright-colored will easily show dirt . That 's hard to avoid between the constant sweating , stains from Thai food splatters , and the general grime on most surfaces . <h> Do n't  bring jeans or clothes made of 100% cotton <p> Thais wear jeans , but its safe to say that most Westerners are n't  acclimated to the heat and will be waaay too hot . Jeans also take a long time to dry on a clothesline and are heavy in your suitcase . 100% cotton shirts take a long time to dry compared to shirts with cotton blends . They also wrinkle easily and do n't  always keep you cool . Leather ( faux or real ) will give you rashes in places you do n't  want . <h> General Cleanliness <p> DO : Collared shirts and shirts that cover the shoulders , pants and tasteful skirts . <p> The general idea of cleanliness is important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your body . <h> Do wear clean clothes and shower often <p> You can easily find laundry facilities in Thailand . Either your hotel or guesthouse will offer those services or there will be coin operated facilities down the street . Worst comes to worst you can wash your clothes in your sink with a bag of powdered detergent from any 7-Eleven . <p> Practice good hygiene habits by taking a shower at least once a day ( if not twice , even if it 's a quick rinse ! ) and doubling up on the deodorant . Also , use baby powder to keep your skin dry ! Our favorite is the Snake Brand Prickly Heat . Sprinkling a little of it all over your body will prevent heat rashes . <h> Do n't  wear dirty clothing or ignore strong body odor <p> Do n't  wear clothes that are worn out , stained , or holey . Toss them and go to a Thai market and buy a few cheap replacements if necessary . <p> Smelling bad is considered impolite so do n't  go more than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , last night 's booze fest , or the garlic and cumin in Thai cuisine " chances are you 'll have a funk going on . Do n't  ignore it . Go buy deodorant in any of the thousands of 7-Elevens . <h> Classy and Comfortable is the Way to Go <p> If you lean towards the modest , classier outfits and clothing made of airy and quick-wicking materials , you can dress appropriate and comfortably . After all , what to wear in Thailand is probably the most important bit of information you 'll want to know as you 're packing your suitcase for your upcoming trip . <p> DISCLOSURE : This post contains some affiliate links .

I am planning a trip to Thailand in July in Chiang Mai we will be hiking to a temple and I 'm not sure what to wear . I need to be covered up for the temple but comfortable enough to hike a few miles . I know that leggings are typically too tight , but would this be an exception ? What do you recommend for this situation ? <p> Thanks for reaching out and asking . You 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but wearing workout clothes is a bit different since there is n't much of an option for women aside from stretch spandex pants . A great alternative is to wear thin , knee-length leggings and then wear a light pair of workout shorts over top ( no matter how short , since you have the leggings on ) . And a t-shirt , not a sleeveless shirt . Hope this helps and again , thanks for asking when you werent sure ! <p> You should n't have a problem in the touristy areas . Thais are generally nice and in places where A LOT of foreigners travel they are n't  shocked so much by differences in appearance . You will get stares , but you know that already just smile back ! Have fun ! <p> Are running shoes ok for my husband and a pair of Toms for me ? I was planning on wearing my Toms for most of the walking/temples , etc and sandals ( Tevas ) for the beach and some other sightseeing ( Erawan Falls ) . I 've also read that its faux pas for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but ! I will buy a sarong when I get to Koh Lanta . Thanks for the post I 've read it more than once ! <p> Toms and Tevas are absolutely fine and actually preferable to flimsy flip-flops . Its important that you 're comfortable while walking if you 're doing a lot of touring . As far as women wearing pants , we 'd maaaaaybe suggest that if you were to travel around a very remote region of Thailand ( say , certain villages in Isaan ) but if you are visiting major cities and sites , pants are totally ok ! Thanks for coming back to the site : ) <p> Crew or v-neck shirts are absolutely acceptable to wear and are not necessarily frowned upon in temples . Its just that collared shirts appear dressier , and erring on the dressier side is better since a temple is a sacred and respected place . If you wear a T-shirt , make sure its clean , does n't  have profanity on it , and it has sleeves .

@@59574596 @8574596/ <h> Mandala Boutique Hotel in Vientiane , Laos <p> There is nothing more satisfying than being greeted by a beautiful and relaxing hotel or guesthouse after a long day of travel . While we were conducting a visa run to Vientiane , Laos , we treated ourselves to a three night stay at the Mandala Boutique Hotel and our experience there is well worth sharing . <p> The Mandala Boutique Hotel is located off a quiet street roughly 1.5 km from the city center of Vientiane , Laos . This is near the downtown river area and conveniently close to the Royal Thai Consulate . We arrived at a bed and breakfast sporting clean lines , traditional Laotian decor , and well maintained grounds . Two women greeted us at the front desk and allowed us to check in our room early , at noon . <h> Mandala Boutique Hotels Superior Room <p> We had a great first impression of our room . It smelled fresh and lightly of lemongrass and the decor tastefully reflected nature and Buddhist themes . The sleek teak floors and furniture were clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap ( no conditioner , though ) and good body towels . We were also happy to find hand towels and wash cloths , something Southeast Asian hotels ( in our experience ) have lacked . <p> The bed was very comfortable . Just the right firmness but with soft sheets , and a fluffy duvet . The mini-fridge was stocked with beer , wine , soda , and some snacks ( for a small price ) and there was complimentary tea , coffee , and a large bottle of drinking water . There were wine glasses in the room , and we were pleasantly surprised that a French press accompanied the small packages of fresh ground coffee . There was also a work station area to set up our laptop . <h> Bathroom <p> The Mandala Boutique Hotel is one of the few places we 've stayed at where both the room and the bathroom were in great condition . Both the sink and shower had hot and cold water temperature controls worked , the water pressure was good , and the shower had both a traditional extendable shower head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in that the bathroom had been recently scrubbed free of the mildew that commonly plagues Southeast Asian showers . <h> Outdoor Seating Area <p> The Mandala Boutique Hotel has several shaded outdoor seating areas with many chaises and padded benches for lounging or sitting . The open air concept made for a peaceful and pretty walk around the hotel and grounds . The hotel also offers bicycles and umbrellas , free of charge , for those who wish to tour the city on their own schedule . Laundry service is also right outside the gate of the hotel . <h> Breakfast <p> Breakfast is served from 7am to 10am in an open-air area separate from the hotel . There is nice variety of fresh fruit , yogurt , granola , croissant and bread with jam , coffee , and tea to choose from . There is an a la cart menu , which included fried eggs with real bacon ; scrambled eggs ; omelet with ham , scallions and tomatoes ; soup with either rice or rice noodles with chicken , pork , or beef . <h> Suggestions <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the wood floors are slick . Avoid wearing socks ! Also , bring a plug adapter if you plan to use any electronics with three prongs ( i.e. , laptop ) as the plugs only accept two prongs . <h> Nearby Attractions <p> The Mandala Boutique Hotel is about a 10 minute walk west towards the Chao Anouvong Park ( featuring the Chao Anouvong Statue ) . Further west is a strip of restaurant and bars serving both local and non-local cuisine . <p> There are also food stalls and small shops selling snacks , fruit , and beverages on the way . Along the Mekong River , running parallel with Fa Ngum Road , is a long paved street where many people were riding bikes , skateboarding , walking and jogging , or simply hanging out .

@@59574598 @8574598/ <h> DIY Chiang Mai Day Trips <p> Chiang Mais pleasantly cool season is about to be taken over by a- hot , hazy seasonal mess . So , before the smoky season makes itself present , we 've thrown together a list of our favorite Chiang Mai day trips you do in the next few weeks . They are fun places that are just beyond the outskirts of the Old City and can be easily explored on your own if you have a day to spare . <p> What 's best about this round-up is that not a single one of these day trips requires pre-planning , reservations , or a tour guide . <p> If you 're already in town , take a headache-free , no-strings-attached mini vacay right now . If you 're in the process of planning an upcoming visit , then squeeze in one of these adventures between your trip to an elephant sanctuary and a- Thai cooking class . <p> As an added bonus , everything on this list is budget-friendly . So aside from what you spend on transportation , Thai snacks or food , and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty affordable day trip from Chiang Mai . <h> Huay Tung Tao Lake- near- Doi Suthep-Pui National Park <p> One of the very first places we explored outside the safe confines of the Old City was Huay Tung Tao Lake- ( or Huay Teung Thao ) . Its only a 15-minute drive away by motorbike and about a 45-minute ride by bicycle . Its also possible to hire- a songthaew driver to drive you there , wait- around , and then take you back . <p> Along the- banks of the reservoir are little straw huts- with pretty views of the surrounding water and mountains . Its perfect for enjoying a leisurely lunch of satisfying Thai food ( not the simplified versions served in the touristy areas of town ) and washing it all down with some Sangsom and soda . The shady road that circles around the lake is- paved and there are some other walking paths that branch off from the main road , too . <p> For an authentic food experience , you cant pass up the famous Night Walking Street or Muang Mai Market in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Nimman , the most modern and trendy area of the city . <h> Mae Sa Waterfalls in Mae Rim <p> About half an hour away , north of the Old City are the Mae Sa Waterfalls . This natural attraction is quite impressive , most notably because there are ten distinct levels and several natural swimming pools ! There 's a hiking path ( roughly 2 km ) that runs along the waterfalls and branches out over outcroppings and ridges for different viewpoints . <p> The Mae Sa Waterfalls have plenty of shady areas to roll out mats and picnic. - We bought some- sweet snacks and grilled meats from the little shops set up at the Doi Suthep National Parks entrance , but you can bring your own food , too . <h> Monks Trail to Wat Pha Lat on Doi Suthep <p> There 's a magical nature trail that snakes its way from the bottom of Chiang Mais nearest mountain , Doi Suthep , to the- secluded temple , Wat Pha Lat . Known as the- Monks Trail , - it gets its name from the hundreds of strips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , marking the- way . <p> As long as you 're able-bodied and have a sense of adventure ( families with children included ) , this pleasant , slightly challenging hike is a good for stretching your legs and seeing Chiang Mais native plants and little critters in the forest . The trail takes about 45 minutes to hike but it will be longer if you stop to look at everything like we did . Afterward , you can ride a songthaew down the mountain or walk back down- the trail . <h> Thai Silk Village &amp; Bo Sang Umbrellas in San Khampaeng <p> Combine these two handicraft villages for a semi-touristy but educational afternoon . The Thai Silk Village has the entire silk-making process on display , from the silkworms eating mulberry leaves and the harvesting process of the cocoons silk threads to the dying and weaving of the silk. - A little further down the road is the Bo Sang Umbrella Village . The ladies there show how mulberry bark is transformed into sa- paper and then dyed , constructed into umbrellas , and finally painted . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 km loop around Chiang Mais countryside . The drive is not very challenging by motorbike and the scenery is fantastic . It takes about two hours from start to finish if you drive straight through . Its better if you budget four or five hours because of all the great stops along the way . Go clockwise , beginning in Chiang Mai then going to Samoeng , Mae Rim , and then back to the city . <h> Mon Cham Nong Hoi Project in Mae Rim <p> So about Mon Cham this is part of the Royal Nong Hoi Projects that promote organic farming . Even though its only 45 minutes from the city , its notably cooler . As a result , the gardens grow cool-weather vegetables , herbs , and flowers . <h> Bamboo Rafting in Mae Wang <p> One of the more relaxed , down-to-earth Chiang Mai day trips weve ever taken is bamboo rafting down the Mae Wang . We got together with a few friends , a cooler of cold drinks , and floated down a lazy river for several hours . And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rough cut bamboo strung together with strips of rubber , we were not uncomfortable and did n't  get that wet . <h> Bua Tong Waterfalls in Sri Lanna National Park <p> The- Sticky Waterfalls- is a fascinating natural attraction near the Sri Lanna National Park . There are three distinct set of waterfalls that are not only pretty but climbable , too ! Instead of slick , slippery rocks as most waterfalls have , they have a rough , slightly spongy surface . <p> Weve been to the Bua Tong Waterfalls a half-dozen times . Usually , we make a stop for lunch by a little outdoor Thai market just a kilometer or two from the waterfalls . Be ready to get wet and get some exercise . The path that goes down the waterfall is pretty steep ! <h> Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep on Doi Suthep <p> Take a 30-minute drive to Chiang Mais most famous temple , Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep . Perched on the side of the citys nearest mountain , it has gorgeous views of the valley below . The temple has a stunning golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore . <p> We went to Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep on our first visit to Chiang Mai . Nowadays , we 've made it a tradition to take visiting friends or family there . Plus , there are many little snack and souvenir vendors at the temples entrance , making it a fun one-stop-shop touristy trip . As a forewarning , there are 300+ steps to get to the top ! <h> Caves in Chiang Dao <p> The- Chiang Dao Caves- are in a little town about an hour away from Chiang Mai . In our non-expert caving opinion , this natural attraction is a satisfying visit . The tunnel route was n't overly strenuous , there were no unsafe spots , and it took less than an hour to complete . Plus , we had a superb guide who lead us- through the dark , twisty turny tunnels at the perfect pace . It was fun to banter with her in our broken Thai . <h> Doi Inthanon National Park on Doi Inthanon <p> Visiting Doi Inthanon , Thailands highest mountain , is another one of our favorite Chiang Mai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- Giew Mae Pan Nature Trail and the gorgeous views high on the peak . This park is definitely best to go during the cool or rainy season when the air is crystal clear for the best views . Be prepared for a long ( it takes 1.5 to 2 hours just to get there ) but memorable day . <h> Getting to all these Chiang Mai day trips- <p> Its convenient and really inexpensive ! to rent a car- for the day . ( Also , having air conditioning rocks . ) Renting a car is a particularly good idea if you are going to Doi Inthanon or Chiang Dao because these two places are more than an hours drive away and taxi drivers are reluctant to go that far . <p> The remaining activities are closer to town and you can get around by hiring a local red truck taxi ( songthaew ) or getting an Uber .

Heres what to do : <p> STEP 1 : - As you pass through the Royal Thai Consulate-Generals gate , there is a standalone registration booth to the right . It has a logbook where- all applicants are required to print their name , nationality , passport number , and type of visa for which they are applying . First , stand in this line ( #1 in the photo above ) andfill out the logbook . <p> STEP 2 : Obtain a blank visa application form and a blank pickup receipt ( numbered ) from the visa application area . This is located up a few steps on a raised open-aired but covered platform area with a few rows of chairs and one large window . On the left-hand side of the window , there is a- line ( #2 ) for the blank application forms and- the blank pickup receipts . Grab one of each from the- ( not so obvious ) consulate officer behind the window . <p> STEP 3:On the right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that says Visa Section . Stand in this queue ( which may be jumbling into the other queues to sign the logbook or getting the application form ) and fill out the- visa application form and the pickup receipt . Submit your pickup receipt , passport , paperwork , photos , and visa fee to the officer behind the window on the right-hand side ( #3 ) . He or she will double check everything and then hand you the pickup receipt with a collection time and date stamped onto it . You are done for now . <p> STEP 4 : - On the following business day , anytime from 2pm to 4pm , pickup your passport with a new shiny Thai visa from the same window you dropped it off . Be sure to bring the pickup receipt . Remember , the consulate is closed on weekends and official public Malaysian and Thai holidays . <p> We did our Thai visa run to Penang on a- Monday and- there were about 20 people in the queue when we arrived at 9:15am . Not long after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took roughly one hour- to submit our application requirements and visa fees before heading back to our hotel . The next day we arrived just after 2pm and it only took 15 minutes to pick up our passports . Very painless , indeed . <p> NOTE : As with any trip to a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate-General , look presentable ! We recommend erring on the conservative side . Men should wear a collared shirt and ladies should wear a shirt that covers their shoulders and cleavage . Its best to not wear sleeveless shirts , short skirts , or shorts . <h> Getting to Penang <p> Malaysia offers a FREE 90-day visa exempt stamp to many international visitors- so its fairly easy to make this a last-minute visa run trip . This is without going through the added expense or hassle of arranging for a visa to one Thailands other neighboring countries . For example , Americans must pay- for 35 USD ( or 1,500 THB ) per person for Laotian visa upon arrival ( at select airports and border crossings ) but to- visit Burma ( 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ) we have to- apply in advance for- a tourist visa . <p> Public bus routes combined with taxis or direct private visa-run service vans are affordable options if you 're coming from Thailands southern provinces .

Once in Penang , we spent the next several days exploring George Towns iconic landmarks on foot ( with the help of the George Town Map and Walks app ) , - drinking the greatly anticipated Carlsberg Royal Stout beer , and eating delicious Chinese , Indian , and Malaysian cuisine in the area . <p> Our hotel was- a fantastic find , too .

The drivers were courteous and always used the meter , which was a stark contrast to our trip to Kuala Lumpur ! That alone has us looking forward to another trip to Penang in the future . <p> TIP : - A taxi from the airport to Chulia Mansion ( 19 km ) cost us 45 RM one way .

From our research ( but not from experience ) , you can not simply convert the non-immigrant ED to non-immigrant B visa within Thailand .

You wrote that you could apply for a multiple-reentry at Thai immigration ; does that mean Thai immigration at the border when I leave ( Laos-Thailand ) , or the Thai immigration office at the city I 'm teaching at ( Chiang Mai ) ? <p> Hello , yes they issue single entry B visas in Vientiane . Once you arrive back in Chiang Mai you will need to apply for the multiple reentry permit at the immigration office near the airport . Glad your visa trip was a success ! <p> The rules change day by day in Thai Consulates , and not just the ones in Asia .

Yes , the best thing to do is to apply for the single entry , and then either get single reentry permits as you need them for 1,000THB a pop , or apply for a multiple reentry permit for 3,800THB .

@@59574607 @8574607/ <h> Island Hopping in Thailands Andaman Sea <p> Each time we 've gone to Thailands southern region we add a few more beaches and islands to our travel repertoire . Six trips and countless boat rides later , we think its about time to put together a guide to island hopping in Thailand off the Andaman coastline . Here goes ! <p> To make things a bit easier , we 've grouped the islands into two categories : <p> " Main Islands " are those that are built up , have well-established mass transportation systems ( ferries , speedboats , etc ) , and a variety of accommodations and restaurants <p> " Smaller Islands " have a more castaway feel and are better suited for daytime visits with the help of boat tours and generally do n't  offer much as far as accommodations or restaurants , if anything at all <p> A video posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Dec 30 , 2015 at 3:09am PST <p> From our experience , Koh Lanta Yai has a little something for everyone and its only a two-hour drive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there on a budget and spend your days lounging in a hammock or swimming at the beach , but there were also some very nice resorts and plenty of outdoor excursions , too . One of our favorite things about the island is the unlimited number of places to watch the sunset . This long , narrow island runs north to south so its entire west coast is populated with bars , restaurants , resorts , and bungalows perfect for grabbing a cocktail and watching the sun go down . <h> Koh Phi Phi Don <p> Koh Phi Phi ( pronounced Pee Pee , not Fee Fee ! ) is accessible by first flying into either Krabi Airport or Phuket International Airport ( HKT ) followed by a short bus ride to a pier and then a transfer by either ferry or speedboat . <p> Parts of Koh Phi Phi Don are quite pretty and the centrally located Tonsai East Shopping Alleyway is a network of narrow streets linking together restaurants , beach shops , and hotels . There are plenty of bars serving up rum buckets and blasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the professional partier ! <p> Unfortunately , this is probably our least favorite island . The crowds were overwhelming and the central area of the island felt dingy and overrun . The food , hotel , and even massages we had were overpriced and the quality was average at best . The biggest disappointment was the beaches , particularly Loh Dalum Bay ; it was muddy at low tide and littered with plastic bottles and other trash . Overrated ? We think so , but wed be willing to give it a second chance and go during low season . <h> Phuket <p> Yacht Haven Marina in Phuket <p> Not only is Phuket Thailands biggest island , but because it has its own airport it is arguably the most convenient and quickest island to travel to in the Andaman Sea . We spent two weeks in Phuket and to our surprise , loved almost every bit of it . We were impressed just how big it was , the number of beaches and different towns we drove through , and the number of things to do in Phuket that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several marinas , its also possible to splurge and go island hopping in Thailands Andaman Sea on chartered speedboats , yachts , and catamarans . <h> Railay <p> Railay is not actually an island ( its part of the Krabi mainland ) , but it would be a shame not to include it among the list of islands off of Thailands southwestern coast . Since this area is only accessible by a network of boats from Ao Nang ( there are no direct roads via the mainland ) , it certainly feels as if it were an island ! There are several different beaches including Tonsai Beach , Railay West , Railay East , and Phra Nang Cave Beach ( our favorite ) . <p> The latter three beaches are connected by a Walking Street with several tiny restaurants and shops selling beach paraphernalia . Phra Nang Cave Beach has immense limestone cliffs that hang over the water and picturesque longtail boats that line up on the shoreline selling snacks and fruit smoothies . Tonsai Beach is great for rock climbing during the day and partying at night . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ao Nang Beach ) to any of these nearby beaches , pack a bottle of liquor in your beach bag . Buy a fruit smoothie for 50 baht and top it off instead of buying a fruity cocktail for 200 baht . <h> Smaller Islands <h> Koh Phi Phi Leh ( Maya Bay Beach ) <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Dec 24 , 2015 at 3:22am PST <p> Infamously known from the movie The Beach , this bay and beach area is spectacular but incredibly overcrowded . Ah , the paradox of tourist attractions ! Arriving early ( before 9am ) makes a big difference . Anytime after that will result in tour boats coming in by the dozens and dumping hordes of people onto the beach . <p> There is also a second overlook point with a partially hidden cove that is accessible by a climbing net . This is a popular spot to snorkel with beautiful views of the nearby islands . <h> Poda Island <p> Overlooking a nearby rock formation from the beaches of Poda Island <p> Poda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it left a lasting impression on us . Its easy to grab a longtail boat from Ao Nang and spend an afternoon there . We noticed that visitors tend to hang around the drop-off point of the island , so its worth it to wander further down the beach because you 'll eventually be completely by yourself . <h> Chicken Island <p> This island is best known for its natural rock formation that looks like the head and neck of a chicken . Its worth passing by and snapping a few pictures of the iconic rock but if you get the opportunity , take your boat around to the back of the island and walk across the exposed sandbar during low tide and connects to Tup Island . <h> Koh Rok Nai <p> Part of a pair of islands , Koh Rok Nais beach looks like a postcard with its nearly white sand and aquamarine waters . Surprisingly , there were not many people on the beaches when we visited during the high season , so it was wonderful to have the place nearly to ourselves . We distinctly remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monitor Lizards and many teeny tiny hermit crabs . We visited Koh Rok Nai during a daytime snorkeling trip ( which was fantastic ! ) but its possible to camp overnight there , too . <h> Hong Island <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Sep 20 , 2015 at 10:03am PDT <p> This island had some very unique coves that are only accessible through narrow passages between towering limestone cliffs . This creates a very hidden , secluded feel . Once inside , there are opportunities to swim and snorkel in the shallow bays as well as to rent kayaks and take a lap around the island in the open waters . <h> Koh Mook ( Emerald Cave ) <p> The Emerald Cave has emerald green waters at its rocky entrance at Koh Mook . After taking a short swim into the pitch black cave ( we saw others go through in small rafts , too ) , it opens up to a secluded beach completely surrounded by cliffs shooting straight towards the sky with sunshine streaming down . The beach and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Koh Lanta Yai , Koh Phi Phi Don , and Phuket . <h> Tup Island <p> See the little people walking between the islands ? <p> The wow factor of this island is the walkable sandbars that become exposed during low tide . These sand strips connect Koh Tup with a small island called Koh Mor as well as a larger island called Chicken Island and create a natural separation in the sea . A word of caution : wear water shoes because the sandbar is full of tiny sharp shells that make it uncomfortable to walk barefoot ! <h> Koh Khao Phing Kan ( James Bond Island ) <p> Khao Phing Kan Island has a major tourist attraction just off its coast : the James Bond Island . This rock formations base is delicately narrow and gets progressively wider at the top . It is most impressive at low tide because its even skinnier than what this picture shows ! We werent allowed to approach the island , but visitors can snap shots from either the mainland or from their boat . <h> The Best Way to Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these islands can be explored by booking a day trip with local boat companies such as Ao Nang Travel and Tour and Opal Speed Boat , both of which offer island hopping packages via speedboat . Tours such as these provide hotel pickups , boat transfers , equipment ( if applicable ) and lunch for the day . Alternatively , you can visit individual islands for the day for cheap by hiring a longtail boat that slowly shuttles visitors back and forth on request . <p> If you really want to do some extreme island hopping in Thailand ( in addition to partaking in some incredible parties with 20- and 30-something vacationers ) , its totally worth checking out The Yacht Week Thailand . This event takes place in December every year with a group of privately chartered yachts and catamarans . The beauty of The Yacht Week Thailand is that although there is a rough schedule of recommended day and night stops at various islands , there 's the opportunity to deviate during the day and visit the smaller islands and attractions such as Emerald Cave , Maya Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well continue to add to this list as we visit more islands in the Andaman Sea , but for now , this is a good start dontcha think ? <p> Are there any must-visit islands we need to add to this list ?

We got to wear play clothes to school and spend an afternoon racing around outside , playing competitive games ( water sports included ! ) , and picnicking . It also signaled the end of the school year and the beginning of summer break . <h> Every Student Looks Forward to Their Thai School Sports Day <p> So it came as no surprise that my Thai students were beyond excited about their upcoming- Thai school Sports Day . <p> I taught at a school- that had Anuban ( kindergarten ) , Prathom Levels 1 through 6 ( elementary school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 .

The younger students rode bicycles and tricycles , and the older girls competed in sprinting and long distance running . Badminton , volleyball , and soccer were- played competitively , too . <p> These little ones were pedaling- so fast , a teacher had to catch them at the end of the circuit . <p> Although good ol sports competitions were in the works , Sports Day truly- seemed to be centered around the parades of flags , the marching bands , and the team spirit of the color-coded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whoever could scream cheer the loudest and shake their pompoms and noise makers with the most enthusiasm was the true winner ! <p> The Thai and foreign teachers participated in the Thai school Sports Day , too .

How did- they know that ( lime ) green was one of my favorite colors ? ! <p> These pictures make me look way more athletic than I actually am . Go cameraman ! For anyone who knows me , I 'm horrible at anything that requires hand-eye coordination with a round object . But I 'm really good at playing defense , er , getting in peoples- way . <p> The foreign English teachers- handed out medals afterwards to the girls who won in their division . <p> At the end of Sports Day , the girls from Matthayom- put on a show .

Not to say that the lovely little American country town where I grew up did n't  have school spirit , it was just- less- intense than what I experienced in Chiang Mai . <p> And lastly , games are key ! As a first year ESL teacher in Thailand , I sometimes lost track of- making sure my students- were actually learning- because I was so focuses on going- through the motions of teaching .

This is how we managed to fly to Thailand without spending any money on our flights , and we have actually racked up enough points to be able fly to the states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our flights to Thailand redeemed using only airline miles from our Capital One Venture card <h> How to Chose the Best Airline Rewards Credit Card <p> The most bang for your buck . 40,000 and 50,000 airline miles are excellent , 20,000 to 30,000 are very good , but anything below that I would n't bother with . <p> The lowest minimum spending requirements . We recommend applying for a card with a minimum spending requirement of $2000 in three months and pass on the card that requires $5k spent in the first month . However , it really comes down to what you are financially comfortable with spending . <p> Compatibility with other credit card mileage rewards . In other words , apply for rewards credit cards where the airline mileage can be combined with other airline offers . Sign up for two Southwest Cards at a time , or at the very least , airlines which are part of the same airline alliance . <p> A direct discount when purchasing from the credit cards associated airline . This is where you 'll need to read the fine print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48,520 miles through his Capital One Venture card . However , I used the Southwest Premier card for the same ticket and was charged 41,766 miles , which is a savings of roughly 15% . <h> Some Additional Bits of Advice <p> Apply for all credit cards of interest in the same day , or better yet , in the same hour , to significantly increase- being approved for all cards of interest . Since credit card companies can see if you have recently opened up another line of credit , they may deny any additional applications because they see you as a higher risk candidate . <p> Apply for the credit cards at least three to four months before your travel date . This will give you enough time to meet the minimum spending requirement to earn the promotional airline miles as well as to allow for the miles to be credited to your account . Keep in mind that airline miles or points will be credited to your account at the end of the monthly statement , and not immediately after each purchase . <p> Once you reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't  actually cancel it as you can sometimes convince the issuing company to wave the annual fee ( if applicable ) the following year . Or , if you are aiming for a tiered status with the airline for more long-term benefits ( such as the Southwest Companion Pass ) , charge up ! but be responsible . <p> Good credit history is necessary for travel hacking . Before applying , ask yourself if there 's a reasonable chance in being approved for even one credit card in your near future , let alone two or three . There is no sense in having multiple denied applications on your credit history if you suspect from the beginning that you wo n't get approved for anything . <p> In general , opening up a credit card also opens up doors for identity theft and general financial troubles . Do this at your own risk ! <p> Sorry for the delayed response but it was the Chase United Mileage Plus card . We also have had accounts at Charles Schwab since our first ATW trip in 2010 and have saved so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips : ) <p> Great article guys ! My boyfriend and I are currently living in Chiang Mai as well until September . We recently looked into credit card miles to save some $$$ for our trip back west in September and were able to score a card with 55,000 miles and a $1,000 spending requirement within the first 3 months ! <p> Liz , 55,000 miles for $1000 is one of the best offers Ive heard ! If you do n't  mine me asking , what company was it with ? Its great that you 've jumped on the bandwagon and have earned miles for a trip back home . Makes you glad to have done the homework on this , eh ? Keep earning those miles wherever/whenever you can ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 4 years 2 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574614 @8574614/ <h> Why I Do n't  Drive a Motorbike in Thailand <p> A recent evening out with new friends prompted a conversation about riding motorbikes in Thailand . Chris and I share a bike but he s the driver and I always ride pillion . Always . I do n't  drive a motorbike in Thailand and probably never will , but I have my reasons why . <p> Anyone who knows me knows that I 'm not a risk taker . I 'd also go so far to say I 'm a safety nut. - I 'm that woman who wont go skydiving and I ca n't be bothered to- gamble. - Thats because I wo n't do something if I know the chances of me getting hurt , losing money , or experiencing negative consequences are high . <p> So boring , I know . <p> With that said , I made the conscious decision not to drive a motorbike after- Chris and I moved to Thailand . That was nearly three years ago and I still do n't  know how to drive one . Sure , I miss my independence that I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenienced by the time I waste walking or trying to hail a songthaew , but I have my reasons . Like I like living . <h> 01 - I have a not-so-great track record <p> Let 's just say I 've gotten in a few accidents in my good ol driving days back in the USA . I was very lucky that in most of the accidents the damage was done solely to my vehicle . None of my accidents injured anyone , myself included . <p> Silly things , like the one time the- light turned green and I started to go ( because that 's what you 're supposed to do ) but the car in front of me did n't  . <p> Or that other time I was actively avoiding a collision with- someone else and ended up causing another accident in the process . <p> Yup , just my luck . <p> I admit that I can get distracted easily . Since riding a motorbike requires a superhuman level of concentration to avoid and prevent accidents , I 'd be a big , fat FAILURE . <h> 02 - I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride a horse by getting on its back and holding on . But that is not how I want to learn how to ride a motorbike . <p> I guess any beginner lacks confidence . Arguably confidence grows with practice . I 've tried riding a motorbike twice and as soon as I hopped on the seat I was- ready to get off . The motorbike was heavy and wobbly . When I reflexively put my foot down to stable myself while practicing turns and making u-turns , my leg got yanked back . Ouch ! The alternative was to not put my foot down and therefore topple over sideways and scrape up the rental and one side of my body . It was pretty much a lose-lose situation and not fun at all . <p> Plus unlike a bicycle , if I was riding a motorbike and it fell over ( god forbid ON me ) , would I be strong enough to pick it up ? If cant physically manhandle the motorbike then I have no business riding it . <p> I think my biggest heartache is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle to fail safe in the accelerating position ! ? Having to pull the throttle backward- to go is the reason countless " superman " accidents happen . SMH . <p> Why- does n't  the throttle require a forward push to accelerate ? Or a sensitive throttle thumb control ? I 'd be so much more confident knowing that I would n't accidentally rev the engine as I straddled the bike and take off flying . Because that 's exactly what I want to do in life : have the bike yank me around and cause me to tear a ligament in my knee or something . We know someone who that happened to ! <p> I- get one chance to counter steer properly , prevent myself from stalling , or successfully dodge potholes - " one chance " or else I- crash . If you ask me , those are some pretty lousy statistics . <h> 03 - I 'm not ready to accept the consequences of an accident <p> I live close to a major clinic in Chiang Mais Old City . I 've seen my fair share of tourists ( although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright white bandages plastered over ankles , knees , and elbows . <p> As a beginner driver , I am not ready to accept the consequences of my sub-par driving skills . - Displaying purple , disfiguring road rash for the next five years- of my life is not on my bucket list . Or , say , having a limp or an ache that never ever goes away . Nope , no thank you. - I 'm thirty , have never broken a bone , and wish to keep it that way . Too bad its likely to happen- since I 'm a newb . <p> That 's not to say Chriss driving skills will keep us completely out of harms way because there are still crazy drivers out there . But he s definitely a much safer , more experienced driver than I am . That would lessen the chance of us getting into an accident. - At least when I 'm a passenger , I trust Chris to handle situations far- better than I can . Hes- taken a week-long motorcycle safety course . Plus , he s had several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand . <p> As a motorbike driver , I 'd hold the heavy weight of- responsibility in my- hands , too . Beginners are- high-risk drivers . If I were to hurt someone , - I would n't be ready for the consequences of dealing with a legal battle . Especially in a foreign country ! <h> 04 - It will always be my fault <p> Were just posing for a picture . We always wear our helmets ! <p> At least in the USA , if you get in an accident the person at fault is usually correctly blamed . But in Thailand , all I 've ever read on forums and heard from other people sharing their experiences is that the foreigner is always to blame for causing the accident . Some hodgepodge about " if the foreigner was n't in Thailand , the accident would have never happened . " <p> Sure , if I cause an accident I have enough integrity to accept the blame . However , if I did n't  cause an accident and got slapped with the blame and bill , I think I would see red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of my own actions . Therefore , I expect the same if someone else were to hit me . Unfortunately , as the foreigner , I am automatically- assumed to have more money . In Thai society , that 's the person who automatically is responsible for paying for an accident , regardless of who 's at fault . <p> I cant wrap my head around it and- I refuse to play that game . <h> 05 - Hit and runs scare me <p> If I were to get into an accident , I would n't trust whatever Thai person or random tourist that hit me to call for help if no one else was around ! That 's because there is no accountability in Thailand . <p> Hit and run accidents- happen a lot here . Although compulsory- insurance- is mandatory in Thailand , A ) does the driver actually have it and B ) will it be enough ? The thought of paying a huge medical bill or replacing a motorbike out-of-pocket can easily convince someone to flee the scene of an accident . And how many tourists do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they go zipping around on Thailands roads ? I know I did n't  get a SIM card when I took my first trip to Thailand in 2012 . <p> I do n't  want to be riding around by myself and something happens where Im left alone , bleeding and broken on the side of the road . At least if I 'm riding with Chris , he s there with me . There 's the chance that one of us is n't knocked out and physically capable of calling the police or functional enough to help the other person . <h> I do n't  drive a motorbike in Thailand and may never do it <p> Maybe I 'm being too cautious and should really give driving a motorbike another try . But at the end of the day , I know my limitations . Its more important for me to be a functional human being than some vegetable hooked up in a hospital somewhere . <p> There may come a time that I work up my courage to drive a motorbike in Thailand . For now , I 'm content with sitting behind Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver ! <p> I ride motorcycles in Australia and fairly good with the Honda VFR but I do n't  ride in Bangkok as its too many traffic but tried it in Pattaya only a few times thinking there was a peak times but found out there is no such thing always busy so left the bike at the Condo as it was easier and less hassle with paying the songthaew instead . In Bangkok easy with the BTS then on foot and Chang Mai on foot from Hotel M with the Sunday night markets next door and nice walk from there to the other night Read more + <p> We 'd never ride in Bangkok ! We end up either using taxis or staying near the BTS . If you 're staying right by ThaPhae gate and do most of your **26;300;TOOLONG within the city , there 's not much reason to have a bike . Its a great spot to get a songthaew , that 's for sure . Drinking and driving never a good combination ! It is sad to hear that your friend had to learn from a hard , expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONCE when I was in Krabi and only because my friends had rented two bikes and I had to take one back ( for another friend who was to hungover to get up ) .

Worst was when we were just returning the bikefor some reason , I accelerated RIGHT at the shop and almost hit all the other bikes that were parked there . My friend said Shayan , never ride a bikeand since then I never have . But Read more + <p> Of all places to nearly have an accident yikes ! We 've actually seen that happen before and the driver ended up knocking over four or five bikes that were parked in a line .

That and so many guidebooks and travel bloggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motorbike " that visitors do n't  realize the difficulty until its too late . <p> The worst is when they are coming at us in OUR lane ! It drives me bonkers seeing drivers so casually cross over the double line to pass cars , and yet they have no intention of yielding to us .. who are in our correct lane ! <p> If you live in or just outside the Old City it is totally possible to live in town without a bike . Songthaews are plentiful and walking is n't too bad in some areas ( although others are severely lacking in decent sidewalks ! ) <p> Thanks for this article ! We will be traveling to Thailand for three months starting in October and I just assumed we 'd rent motorbikes while there . My stepmother is Thai and my father ( American ) refused to drive in Thailand when they lived there , but I always assumed he was being " an old fuddy duddy . " He stated a lot of the same reasons as you , but hearing it now from multiple sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes its like a video game on a motorbike here , but I love riding mine here in CM , and feel safer than riding mine in the states .

I resolved never to drive any vehicle in Bangkok ever the first time I went there in 1979 . Believe it or not , it is a little saner now than it was then , but I still wont drive . Same thing for Pattaya , Chieng Mai , and the larger provincial capitols . When I was living in a village in Sisaket , I rode a bike , but never into town songteaw for me .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to ride by now or at least bought a tiny car so that I 'd be sane ! ( Theres no sense in owning a car living so close to the moat , it only adds to the congestion . ) Chris wont even ride a motorbike in Bangkok . Tooooo crazy ! <p> I got to Thailand two weeks ago with the full intention of renting a bike when I got up north . After watching the ( lack of ) traffic patterns for the past couple weeks , Ive done a 360 . I feel the same as you , just not worth the risk . I do n't  have the proper experience and would be nothing but a hazard on the road . <p> I would n't even ride a motorcycle taxi . But how about a car ? You know 8 miles from home vloggers have a car ( albeit a very old one ) and they seem to cover a lot of distance in Thailand and so far they seem accidents and trouble free . Today I saw a farang on scooter without helmet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai style over center line when they got caught in traffic ( as a four wheels vehicle driver I really find them annoying coming my way expecting me that they have the right of the way ) .

It was so interesting to be in a car after a year or so riding on a bike no helmet hair , no sunburn , no shouting at each other to be heard oh and the music ! The motorbike taxis in Bangkok intrigue me , although I 'd have to carry around my helmet with me everywhere I went ! <p> Good article Angela , but it all seems to be about your ability ( or lack thereof ) and very little mention of the idiots on the roads here . It is dangerous riding here , whether experienced or not . Like Chris , I 'm a bike rider from my home country , but it still concerns me riding bikes around LOS .

Just not worth it for now . <p> You definitely have your reasons Angela . Thanks for writing an excellent and candid report . Ive been here two months and I also had many years of motorcycle experience in the US , but I still have n't ridden a scooter or motorcycle here in Thailand yet . The driving here , both the drunk driving and simply incompetent driving frankly scares me .

Since no one really follows rules , it a lot harder to anticipate where another motorcyclist is going to turn or give right away . Maybe in the country beachside with less people you 'll have more confidence . <p> I 'm right there with you on this one and for almost all the same reasons . My little sis on the other hand handled her scooter like a pro when she came to visit us last fall . I 'll admit I was a little jealous , but I think being the b*tch on the back has a lot of perks . 161248 @qwx571248

Its a pretty popular spot to dine at by both visitors and expats and is often recommended as a " thing to do " on online reviews . here 's our own recommendations , which include a tour of our favorite vendors and a weeks worth of dinners spliced together all for less than 100 baht ( $3 USD ! ) per meal . <p> The Chiang Mai Gate food stalls start setting up around 5pm every day and a few vendors even stay open past midnight . A great variety awaits the curious consumer and all for the going price of about a dollar per dish . <p> TIP : Whenever we reference " to the left " or " to the right " , it is as if you are standing directly in front of the food stall looking at it ( not behind or to the side ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 BAHT <p> + <p> 35 BAHT <p> = <p> 55 BAHT <p> MANGO , PASSION FRUIT , &amp; PAPAYA SMOOTHIE <p> BEEF NOODLE SOUP <p> Ms. Pa and her fruit smoothies are well known among the Chiang Mai Gate food stall scene . Armed with two blenders and a great choice of fresh seasonal fruit , she often has a long line of customers . Any fruit combo costs a mere 20 baht . She has a prime spot , located roadside along the eastbound lanes of the moat . <p> This guy is always open past 12AM midnight , too ! <p> Directly to the right of Ms. Pa is a man who sells noodle soup with clear broth . We recommend the soup with super tender slices of beef ( neua soht ) and your choice of skinny or wide rice noodles . He also sells fresh slices of chicken and pork , as well as bite-sized hotdog-like beef , chicken , pork , and fish balls . He has an English menu from which to easily order , several tables , and always has big condiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within arms reach to jazz up your noodles . <h> TUESDAY Northern Thai Curry with Egg Noodles and Kanom Kroke <p> 35 BAHT <p> + <p> 10 BAHT <p> = <p> 45 BAHT <p> NORTHERN THAI CURRY <p> KANOM KROKE <p> If you had to eat one dish while in Chiang Mai , try the popular Northern Thai curry called khao soi . Its a cross between yellow and red coconut based curry ladled over fresh egg noodles and topped with a smattering of deep-fried egg noodles . The food stall to the right of the beef noodle soup stall serves their khao soi with chicken . You 'll also be given a small plate of condiments that include lime , sliced scallions , smokey chili paste , and pickled bok choy . <p> Finish dinner with kanom kroke , a small and gooey pillow-like Thai dessert prepared in a hot skillet with a batter made of coconut milk , rice flour , and sugar . There is a stand with an umbrella near the Chang Mai Gate brick wall after crossing over the eastbound lanes away from the moat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn , julienned slices of sweet potato , or chives .

Add lettuce , onion , and carrots then top it off with any combo of three sauces . This vendor is located just outside the Chiang Mai Gate brick wall under the morning markets awning area . <p> Do n't  forget to grab a mango , pineapple , and banana smoothie from Ms. Pa .

Try a tart but refreshing smoothie combo of watermelon , pineapple , and orange . <p> What 's a visit to Thailand without a taste of one of its more popular flavors , tom yum . This hot and sour flavor combo is due to lemongrass , gangalal ( a root in the same family as ginger ) , lime , and fresh chilies .

The grilled meat vendor has squeezed himself on the sliver of sidewalk along the eastbound lanes of the moat . He has a tall silver chimney with trails of smoke coming out . He sells skewers of bite sized pieces for 5 baht and bigger portions , such as chicken legs or chicken quarters , for more . This vendor also sells other chicken bits such as tails , heads , liver , and kidney for the more adventurous eater . Do n't  forget to ask for a 5 baht bag of sticky rice . <p> Grab papaya salad from the food stall two stalls to the left of him ( directly to the right of the khao soi stall ) . Make the som tum spicy if you dare with two or three small red chilies . <p> End this meal with a rotee , a snack similar to a flattened stuffed crepe .

The tender pork is accompanied by brightly blanched Chinese kale , rice , and a delicious spicy and tangy sauce . For an extra five baht you can add a hard-boiled egg . <p> A classic Thai dessert of mango and coconut sticky rice can be found almost directly across the street . Sometimes you can find this dish drizzled with sweetened condensed milk and sprinkled with puffed rice , but other times its served plain . We think the mangoes here are unbelievable and do n't  need the added sugar , but try whatever you 'd like . <h> How to Order Food from Street Stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English menus or signs ( many with descriptions of the food ) , so you can either point to or say what you want to eat quite easily without worrying about a language barrier . Additionally , the food vendors selling main courses ( not desserts or smoothies ) have tables to sit at and free drinking water . <p> When you are finished eating , leave your used plate and silverware on the table , go back to the vendor , and pay the vendor in cash , preferably in bills of 100 baht or less . They have good memories and will look at you and the tell you the price . <h> Have Fun Exploring the Variety at the Chiang Mai Gate Food Stalls <p> There you have it !

Was thinking of printing out a card in thai saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai food uses rice flour and corn flour as thickening agents and yes , lots of rice and rice noodles served with meals , so its a fairy gluten-free-friendly cuisine .

The concept of having a debilitating allergy is not as widely accepted in Thailand as in Read more + <p> Great review . I printed it and will use it for our trip which begins next week . One question I was told its the water that makes you sick so how safe are the smoothies ?

Enjoy ! <p> I 'm going to be living in Chiang Mai for three months over the summer for an internship with my school ( BYU ) . In our security briefing , we were told that the food from street vendors is usually super unhygienic and can make you super sick . Is that an overdramatization ? <p> Yes , its an overdramatization . Although hygiene standards are different in Thailand than in the USA , street stalls can make food that is safe to eat . Obviously do n't  eat at stalls where its clearly unkempt , but many vendors handle their food with care and the turn over rate is fast so the food does n't  have time to sit out and go bad . Additionally , there are different strains of bacteria over here , so its possible to have a gurgly stomach for the first week or two no matter where you eat as your body ets used to that and the different ingredients. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for sharing .

You nailed it . <p> Certainly ! We run into our readers from time to time and enjoy hearing about their experiences in Chiang MAi . Weve tried meatless Monday but quickly realized that its really hard to get the protein our body needs from vegetarian meals : / At least the stalls at Chiang Mai Gate are good about leaving out meat for vegetarians . <p> Yes , and there is a third Halal stall selling biriyani . Delicious ! If you locate the 7-11 on the eastbound lanes , continue walking just a bit more Westward ( away from the main food stall area ) , pass a pharmacy on your right , and then its right there with a yellow food cart .

During our trip to Hua Hin , we not only found this inner-coastal town to be tourist friendly and beautiful , but it is bustling with an amazing array of fresh seafood that weve sorely missed since moving to landlocked Chiang Mai . There is something to be said about enjoying seafood in Hua Hin at waterfront restaurants , little side street venues , or watching fresh seafood plucked from the ice and grilled a-la-cart from street vendors at Hua Hins Night Market .

@@59574622 @8574622/ <h> Driving Tips for Thailand <p> After driving around Thailand for almost a year , we 've learned a lot about the unspoken rules of the road . At first glance , Thailands infamous " driving dance " seems like a chaotic jumble of moving vehicles , but there is actually a method to the madness . Knowing these driving tips and adjusting your driving style accordingly can make for safer and more enjoyable ride in Thailand . <p> Here is an extensive list of driving tips to make your time on the streets of Thailand a bit safer . Its composed of our observations and things weve come to expect about the Thailands drivers . So far , adapting to this new style has kept us safe and able to explore places in Northern Thailand on our motorbike . <h> Drive on the left side <p> The most noticeable difference for some visitors is that driving occurs on the left side of the road . At first it can be weird to parallel park on the left , turn left at stoplights , and yield to oncoming traffic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few times we found it hard to imagine driving on the right side . <h> Make slow and deliberate lane changes <p> Most drivers change speed or direction slowly and deliberately when making a turn or switching lanes . Rather than looking out for turn signals , keep your eyes peeled for more subtle signals . These include a hand held down at a person 's side or someone gradually moving over from one side of the lane to the other . We are especially careful not to switch lanes too quickly around cars . You must be considerate of their blind spots ! <h> Notify others of your upcoming presence <p> A polite beep is used to make another driver aware of your presence . Drivers sometimes issue a light beep around blind curves or before entering narrow streets . They also honk as they approach intersections that they know they will pass through as the light is yellow or as it just turns red so that people do n't  pull out suddenly . Its a polite way of saying , " Hey , I 'm here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration . If another driver is coming over into your lane , break slightly and let them in . Honking excessively and declaring that space as your own and branding them of their wrong doing makes you look silly and obnoxious . <p> Something else to keep in mind is if someone flashes their headlights at you it generally means " Get out of the way I am bigger than you , and I 'm coming through . " <h> Park ( mostly ) wherever <p> Parking is generally unrestricted . Cars can be found parked halfway into the bushes on narrow streets or helter-skelter on curbs . Motorbikes are crammed wherever there is two feet of space and even lined up on sidewalks . If you can fit , you can park ! The same goes with parking lots and garages . <p> Watch out for the signs that say " No Parking on Even/Odd Days " or " No Parking from 7-9am. " - Curbs that have red and white stripes are also off limit . Areas in Bangkok ( on the sides of major highways ) and areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off limits . <h> Pay attention to the drivers in front of you <p> Weve observed Thais paying attention to the people in front of them and not so much to the people behind them . This seems to explain why drivers confidently switch lanes without so much as a glance in their rearview mirrors or a quick head turn to check their blind spot . <p> Although it has taken a lot to get used to , sticking to what 's in front of us has proven time and again to keep us safe . There has been more than one occasion when we 've look over our shoulders only to have to quickly swerve to avoid a sudden stopped vehicle in front of us . <h> Lookout for vehicles stopped in driving lanes <p> Keep your eyes peeled for vehicles that make sudden stops and are parked in driving lanes . This goes back to the idea that parking is allowed almost wherever , sometimes without the consideration to those who are driving . Guilty parties are often songthaews and tuk-tuks pulling over to drop off or pick up customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to run into a store for a minute . " Although they are n't  parked , keep a look out for the food vendors slowly pushing their carts in the street , too . <h> Do n't  assume drivers will stop at intersections <p> Stop signs are not regularly posted at small intersections . Even if a stop sign is present , it is not uncommon for drivers to roll through an intersection or road junction without even a glance over their shoulder to look for oncoming traffic . Make sure to keep a look out for motorcyclists suddenly pulling out even if they do n't  have the right of way . Following this simple driving tip has saved our butts a few times from careless people zipping around the back streets of Chiang Mai . <p> Keep in mind that small intersections in the main part of town often have blind corners because buildings are built so close to the streets edge . This limits visibility of people coming across the intersection in front of you . <h> Be wary of crosswalks <p> There are designated crosswalks- for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in busy areas . Although its pretty typical to see crosswalks at intersections , they also pop up in pedestrian heavy areas along main roads . <p> Heres what we do at crosswalks that are not tied to an intersection . We 've noticed Thais doing the same thing : <p> When the traffic light ( for vehicles ) is green , go , but keep your eye out for crossing pedestrians . <p> When the traffic light is red , go , but keep your eye out for crossing pedestrians . <p> In other words , if there are no pedestrians physically present in the crosswalk directly in front of your vehicle , we feel expected to continue driving though. - If you stop for a crosswalks red light but the pedestrian has yet to pass or have finished crossing in front of you , you actually risk getting rear ended ! <p> What keeps us safe is slowly approaching the red light and creeping through . We make sure to never get beside a truck or another vehicle that we ca n't see around just- in case- there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Use lanes as guidelines <p> Although there may be paint on the road indicating designated driving lanes , you may think they do n't  exist at all after watching some drivers weave back and forth . Motorcyclists in particular are notorious for riding wherever there is open space , beyond lanes , including : <p> The sidewalk <p> The shoulder <p> The double yellow line <p> In between lanes of cars <p> Into oncoming traffic <p> Down one-way streets <p> To be safe , we never assume that drivers in front of or beside us will stay in their lane . <h> Congregate at stoplights <p> Motorcyclists- wait in line behind cars at red lights , right ? Hardly ! Do what the locals do and drive in between the cars or on the shoulders and get as close as possible to the front of major intersections . Its common for cars to leave some space between themselves and the white line so that motorcyclists can come to the front . <p> It is also typical for motorcyclists to zoom off as soon as ( or even right before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in mind so you are n't  run over by someone overtaking you as the stoplight countdown goes from 2-1-0 , or someone coming from across the intersection trying to run a red light . Lights with visible timers are typically placed at very large intersections where drivers usually have a full view of all lanes of traffic ( opposite and both sides ) . <h> Wear a helmet ( if you 're riding a motorcycle ) <p> Riding around without a helmet is extremely dangerous . Period . Even if the mental image of brains smeared on pavement does n't  convince you to wear a helmet , then maybe money out of your pocket will . There are police checkpoints stationed about and they will fine you , locals and foreigners alike , for not wearing a helmet . It may be a double whammy too , if you do n't  have an internationals or Thai drivers license to show . <p> We always wear helmets and full faced is the way to go . <p> TIP : If you drive in Thailand , you must have an international driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your- international- license must be approved to drive a car ; if you want to drive a motorbike , your - international license must be approved to drive a motorbike . If you do not have an international license , you will be fined . For long-term stayers , we recommend that you apply or a Thai license . <h> Observing these Thai driving tips has kept us safe <p> Paying more attention to the Thai driving style and what 's happening around us in real-time has helped us stay safe . This is not to say that throwing the hard road rules to the wind is a good idea , but knowing what to expect on the roads and how to react in certain situations has made us safer drivers . <p> What 's your experience been like driving around Thailand ? Is there anything you tend to look out for ? Is there anything you enjoy about driving in Thailand ? <p> Its going to be hard to resort to the " old way " of driving when we visit home in the US. - With all that extra pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rush hour traffic ! <p> We got a stopped today for not having an international drivers license but we have valid USA licenses . Rented a bike , drove out of lot , got told to stop and got a ticket a few minutes later we may have been swindled ? <p> Quite possibly . Police officers are well aware that rental shops do n't  require an int license to rent the shops just want to see you have a passport . So , if the cop sits a little ways down the road , and pulls over anyone with a visorless bucket helmet ( dead giveaway that you 're a renting tourist ) , there 's a good chance that theyll catch someone without the right license . Sucks that it happened ! <p> Hi Chris and Angela Your posts are so informative and helpful . Thanks for sharing them so openly . I 'm in the process of buying a new bike and I was wondering if the two of you went the extra steps to get Thai drivers licenses . <p> We do have Thai drivers licenses . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were something worth having . We got them a few months after we bought our Honda Forza . If you brought an international drivers license with you to Thailand , you wont have to take the drivers test ! <p> Steve makes a good point which needs highlighting . As a foreigner you are likely to be held liable even when its clearly not your fault . Not always , but the police will usually side with the Thai , , if only because he knows the Thai has less money than the farang and maybe no insurance anyway . <p> To drive in Thailand , a tourist needs an international driver license ( written in English ) . A license from your home country will not work you will be fined . Eventually you will need to invest in a Thai drivers license for long term stay . <p> Thailand is now #2 in the world for road deaths , and #1 in the world for foreigners dying on the road .

When you are in an accident , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually be your fault and you will be expected to cash out the other person and pay for their damage as well as hospital bills .

Its a refreshing alternative to be able to move someones car out of the way as needed , but it also involves a bit of trust .

Instead , they are- hand crafted and created by local artists at Baan Phor Liang Muen in the neighboring town of- Lumphun . <p> In fact , the artwork is available for sale but you 'll be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating your own clay art , we learned that its possible to take classes in sculpting and pottery right inside the garden ! Sessions must be arranged in advanced and will be with the local artists themselves . <p> Looks like a fantastic place to spend your time on your day off , or just by yourself . My guess it that it usually is n't as tranquil as on the pictures , but how crowded does it usually get in the evenings ? Would this be for eating food and drinks only or a workplace ( laptop , WIFI ) as well ? <p> The cafe is open until 5pm but we do n't  know how late the gardens are open until or how well lit the place is in the evenings . We saw other people with laptops although we just came to relax and enjoy an afternoon snack . <p> Firstly let me just say that I love your website/blog . Really great stuff . <p> I am from South Africa but I am actually coming over to Thailand in December 2015 to teach English there and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of information on while I did my research . So thanks so much for that . <p> Great article , I just love this place , spent a short time there before it had a coffee shop wishing for just that thing so I could stay longer . Will go back for sure after I move to Thailand in a short time . Thanks for address did n't  think I would find it again . Cheers Helen D. <p> Yes , putting a coffee shop there ( with food , too ! ) was a fantastic idea . All more reason to stay longer and visit more often . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 1 year 11 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574627 @8574627/ <h> Thoughts Before I Quit My Job <p> This rant encompasses my thoughts just before I quit my job and has been parked in my draft folder for quite sometime . I wrote it on the ride home from work after Angela picked me up on the day before I submitted my written letter of resignation . After reading this for the first time since the evening I wrote it , our lives have changed so much . We now live with a new-found freedom in our lives . Our daily lives are free from the distractions of the rat race and tedious mind numbing routines . Yes , there are new challenges that we face , but doing something fulfilling takes away the feelings of " I guess I have to do this " and replaces them with feelings of " I cant wait to do this ! " Working on projects that you are fully inspired by and invested in makes all the difference . <p> Here goes <h> Thoughts Before I Quit My Job <p> So the time is upon me . The time to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current place of work . The time to finally quit my job . It has been a hard decision to be faced with , and it consumes me with the feeling of fear of burning bridges in the process . ( I guess it is out in the open now , huh ! ? ) Of course there is part of me that wants dearly to stay late one evening , clean out my office , and simply leave , never to be heard from again . Instead , I will be the professional my coworkers know me to be and put in my formal two weeks notice , followed up with a written letter of resignation . I will exit quietly . <p> Last days at work . By this point I have my shed suit and tieand my enthusiasm <p> No , there will not be any grand speech or any rant about what I dislike about the company . My internal revolution is what I have been secretly planning during the long work days over the last year . My big exit will entail me selling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " box life " . <p> " Wait a second Chriswhat is the box life ? " you ask . Let me explain , as it is very simple . <h> A Day in the Box Life <p> Wake up in your overly expensive box home <p> Sit in traffic in your box car <p> Arrive at your box job <p> Mindlessly stare at a glowing box all day <p> Sit in traffic in your box car <p> Arrive back to your overly expensive box home <p> Stare at your 55 ? glowing box as it tells you that you need bigger and better boxes <p> Repeat <p> The box life is filled with many different types of boxes , and my box job is what society would tell you is very decent and good . I work as an Operations Manager for a small government contractor . It makes for an easy commute , pays well , provides great benefits , and offers a decent retirement plan . What more could I ask for , right ? In this economy I should be thankful to even have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not fulfill me as a human being anymore . In recent months , I am having a really hard time differentiating between the day , weeks , and even months . My younger years in life are slipping away before my own eyes and I can not bear to let it go on any longer . Like some of you , I honestly feel like I have worked on the same spreadsheet for three years now , and in some respects , I have . <p> I know some people might say that I am being selfish for wanting to just up and quit my job . Well you want to know something ? They are right , and I have absolutely no shame in saying so , but by no means am I ungrateful or unappreciative of the opportunities that have been given to me . I have both amazing coworkers and leaders that truly care , and our bonds will remain strong for a long time to come . At the end of the day it simply comes down to the fact that this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of any one person that I work with , or for . My heart is just not into working to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of other people , and at this point I am ready to abandon that societal norm to pursue what moves me . <p> Feeling Free <p> " What will I do if I do not have a " real " job ? " one may ask . My answer to that is a simple one anything that I want to do . Mainly , work to generate a passive income through less conventional ways . One that is substantial enough to provide me with the means to be able to travel and work on any personal projects that capture my interest . I do not need , nor do I desire to live on what I am currently making . My salary and " stuff " will no longer define me . I will live to experience new countries , cultures , and to tackle personal goals . <p> Since beginning to ponder the thought of checking out of " the box , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hopping a flight to Southeast Asia , walking the narrow people filled streets , and just take it all in . Being that Angela and I made the trip to Thailand in October 2012 for our honeymoon , it only makes the thought more real and achievable . We have a little more than 45 days to sell the rest of our belongings , part with our apartment , and spend a little time with our understandably apprehensive friends and loved ones . We have to make the most of the time we have and unfortunately , my job is getting in the way . <p> That is why I have decided to make my last day at work Monday February 4 , 2013 . Thirty days out from the day we fly to Thailand . <p> Everything we own the night before we boarded our one way plane to Thailand <p> Well , I hope you enjoyed reading my inner thoughts and ramblings the thoughts racing through my head right before I was finally about to reach the completion of my hard-fought yearlong plan to quit my job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , am I suggesting that everyone quit their jobs , sell their stuff , and jump on a plane to a foreign land halfway around the world ? <p> Not at all , unless of course that is what you want to do . <h> Am I suggesting that there are n't  any people out there that actually enjoy what they do ? <p> No , a small minority undoubtedly have landed their dream jobs and everything is probably going great in their lives . What I am suggesting is that if you are n't  one of these lucky few , then stop wasting your time fulfilling someone elses dreams , goals , or target profit margin . <h> Are you going to get rich ? <p> I do n't  know yet . You probably wo n't become a millionaire , but the experiences you gain will substantially enrich your life passed what the nine-to-five has to offer . Way beyond the next promotion , or the next employee of the month award . <h> Is everyday going to be a vacation ? <p> No , you will probably work harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will personally and intimately mean something more to you . <h> Will you become a more complete person with sole authority over your life ? <p> Yes , you will literally call all the shots and make all the important decisions . The decisions that will directly influence whether you succeed or fail . Sound appealing ? <p> Let me be the one to remind you that this is your life . Start doing what means something to youwhatever it is ! This may require some thought . If you are like I was and so enthralled in someone elses agenda , it is easy to forget what once made you excited . I challenge you to spend the rest of the day , week , or even month trying to remember who you are and reacquainting yourself with that person . The person you used to be before you jumped headfirst into the nine-to-five . You know ? Before you said , " If I get this good paying job , I will be able to do all the things I have ever wanted to do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even the things you did n't  know you needed to buy before someone in that glowing box told you that you did . <p> Although , if you have found a way to somehow buy more time , we are all ears . <p> Remember the bridge will always be there when you are ready to cross it <p> Yeah , great question ! The short version : It feels more like a weekend , since we are n't  obligated to get up at a certain time , dress in our daily uniform , and commute . We get up when we want to , make a a to-do list ( and whether we accomplish those goals is solely up to ourselves and not a boss ) . We my stay in our PJs until 2pm . Sometimes we do n't  leave the house for the first time until we are hungry for dinner . But you 're right , there is so much more work with a travel blogger . Technically , we work every single day. Read more + <p> I loved reading your post . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here in the States for about two more years until my husband gets citizenship , then we are off again like rockets . Your post reminds me to continue thinking outside of the boxes and eventually box the boxes in the face when we leave . We hope to cross that lovely bridge soon ! <p> TTT , I see this is an older post that you tweeted today . No less enjoyable to read your thoughts as they were a year ago when you were early in your job quitting and traveling days . My wife and I honeymooned in Bali and we decided wed return , likely on an anniversary one day . We loved it there . I hear you about the boxed life . We are living it now . However , I had some good times traveling in my 20s and my perspective on owning bigger TVs and better things is not the same as it would be if I Read more + <p> Thanks , RBD . While we do n't  know what the future holds for us , living overseas now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a great learning and self-developing experience . Those things can applied for the rest of our lives for the better , whether or not we choose to go back to the US or elsewhere . Since you 've traveled before , you probably have even more motivation to meet your early retirement goals . That 's pretty awesome ! <p> Chris , I have to say that this is the first time I have come across anyone online talking about the boxed life . Its so funny because I have spread this message to a few people , and when I did at my job they just looked at me puzzled and thought I was completely crazy at the same time . I 'm happy to see people who realize that our systems are just that , systems . They are in place for control and order .

Wanderlust has always been apart of me . I wanted to travel when I was seven years old . Spain , Spain , Spain . That 's all I ever talked about .

Congratulation on changing the shape of your box and thank you for your hard work and the love you put into your site ! <p> Boom ! Great Post , I love reading inner ramblings of similar minded people . Its so funny how the same thoughts seem to enter all of our heads during our 20s crisis years . But the way we deal with those issues will ultimately define our future . Good on you guys for being brave enough to break free from the things that were enslaving you . <p> Thought you might appreciate this one . You are right . It is so easy to just push down the urge do something more . Imagine the regret years later if we did n't  go ahead and do what we believed in during our 20s. 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 4 years 1 month ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574629 @8574629/ <h> My Typical Day as a Teacher in Thailand <p> A little spring cleaning unveiled a tote bag of my old teaching supplies and lesson plans during my- first year living in Chiang Mai . Let 's take a stroll down memory lane and see what my typical day as a teacher in Thailand was like . <p> As many fellow English-speaking expats may have- already done or are considering to do , I , too , became a teacher in Thailand . I was personally curious about the profession , had prior experience tutoring adults ( which I later found out was nothing like being a primary level school teacher ) , and wanted to make money while Chris and I were first getting our footing as newbie expats . <p> I took a TEFL course after moving to Chiang Mai , and upon- earning my certificate , I was immediately offered and accepted a full-time position teaching 24 classes per week for 28,000 baht per month at a private Thai school not far from where we lived . <p> Heres what my typical day as a teacher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day <p> Grade 2 rendition of " Teacher Ahn-ger-RAH " <p> My typical day as a teacher in Thailand started by waking up around- 6:45am Monday through Friday . I did my morning routine of- putting on make-up , doing my hair , and ironing my work- clothes . <p> The female foreign teachers dress code at my school included knee-length or longer dark colored skirts ; pants , dresses , and short skirts were not allowed . Ladies were also asked to wear blouses or collared shirts that- were light colored or white with minimal pattern . <p> I was n't expecting such a conservative dress code , - so that meant that I had to buy a whole new teacher- wardrobe . The few patterned skirts , pair of dress slacks , and nice but non-collared shirts I had brought over with me from the US werent going to cut it . <p> I wore- black and- dark grey shoes . In fact , I do n't  think I would have survived teaching without having my comfortable pair of Crocs ballet flats . <h> 7:50AM Arriving at School <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorbike each morning . People have asked me how I learned to ride side-saddle , and this is how : the first time I wore a- narrow pencil skirt to school I did n't  have time to change , so I got on the back of our- motorbike sideways and held on tight . Ive been doing it ever since ! <p> I would arrive at school just shy of 8am every day . It gave- me just enough time to walk down the street and grab breakfast of moo bping- skewers of grilled pork and sticky rice for myself and Chris and then I walked through the schools entrance and clocked in . <p> On Mondays and Tuesdays , I 'd pick up my heavy stack of photocopied worksheets for the week , which I had dropped off at the copy room on Friday . I 'm glad they were made at school- and were free-of-charge because it was about a- foot high . <p> I 'd go straight to the foreign English teachers lounge and drop the- worksheets off at my desk. - I 'd open the shutters of our screen-less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no AC in any of the classrooms or teachers lounges ) , and- dive into my paperwork . Often times that meant rushing off to the- computer lab to print out flash cards , or if necessary , hand draw and color in the flashcards- and then write up answer keys to my worksheets . <p> Otherwise , I- usually jumped right into- grading for the next hour until my first class at 9:10am , second period . <h> 8:00AM Morning Assembly <p> While I was conducting paperwork in the teachers lounge or computer lab , school started at- 8:00am and the Thai teachers and students assembled in the courtyard . I did n't  take part in the morning rituals , but I was aware of what the students and Thai teachers did every day . <p> There were roughly 1,100 pratom ( elementary-equivalent ) students that sat on the concrete ground and listened to announcements lead by the schools vice principal. - Students sung the national anthem and then around 8:15am were dismissed for their classes , the first of which started at 8:20am . <p> I taught every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six and twelve years old in pratom 1 through 6 . My schedule was on a- two week rotation , so I had 550 students the first- week and then the remaining 550 students the second week . <h> 9:10AM First Class of the Day <p> Although the second period of the day started at 9:10am , this was my first class four out of five days of the week . There was one sweet-sounding bell to notify students that it was time to switch class , but surprisingly no second bell . <p> I 'd go to the students home room ( either on the first , second , or third floor of the school ) , line them up , and- have them follow me several flights of stairs down to the ground floor where my classroom was . Needless to say , I got a great leg workout every day . <p> The first five minutes of class were typically dedicated to getting my- students seated and passing back graded papers . It was one of the few chances to make a solid name-face connection . I- learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accent on the last syllable ( Sutita , Baitoey , Oy , Jui , Narumon ) but there were always a- few students with unique vowel sounds that I butchered endlessly and for that Im forever sorry ! A handful had Western names ( I 'm equally forever thankful ) , and some had really cute nicknames like- Mint , Guitar , and Donut . <p> My school assigned a number to each student in every class , - so I often relied on their numerical labels to determine who was who . Unfortunately , half- the students English phonetically spelled names did not quite match up with the true Thai spelling of their name in my master gradebook . Other students used nicknames with no last names. - And as any teacher knows , it was inevitable that at least one student per class forgot to write their name at all . <p> I 'd spend the first 15 or 20 minutes of class teaching new vocabulary and concepts . I quickly found out that teaching solely in English , as per instructed by my school director , just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lesson plan and made sure to write the Thai words on the blackboard along with the new English words . <p> The next 20 to 25 minutes was worksheet time . I quickly learned that I- couldnt just pass out worksheets and have students dutifully fill the answers in while I sat down and had quiet- time. - Thats because my- students English skills varied wildly within each class . <p> If I did that with the older students ( pratom 4 5 , 6 ) , I 'd have a third of the class finish the worksheet within five minutes and then the other two-thirds of the class ignore the worksheet altogether and start playing games . So their worksheets were mostly empty and we would fill them in together ( real-time ) with small games , making lists , and group work where afterwards students shared their answers . <p> With- the younger children ( pratom 1,2,3 ) , I spent a lot of time keeping them seated and focused- on the worksheet . I was constantly answering questions about- what to do next or give them reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick or pair of scissors . <p> A few minutes before the bell rung , I 'd attempt to get everyone to stand up , say their goodbyes ( a roaring " Goodbyyyyye aaaaand thaaaaaank yoooooou , teeeeeeacherrrrr ! " ) , and then collect their papers as they were leaving . On good days , I got my students- to hand their papers back in numerical order , which saved me a little- time later putting the papers in order for easier grading . I always took a few more minutes with the- younger classes to line them up and have them follow me upstairs and back to their homeroom Thai class so there were no stragglers . <h> 20 Minute Morning Break <p> I loved that my school provided breaks for both students and teachers in the middle of the morning . Take a hint American schools ! The- mini-recess- was from 10:00am to 10:20am , and although it always felt like it went by a little too fast , I welcomed the opportunity to sit down , grab a snack , and refuel on some coffee . Students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on homework . <p> There was a little snack shop which sold hot soup , baked goods , little grilled or fried meats , bags of noodles or rice , and drinks . Most items cost- between 5 and- 10 baht . It was just enough to keep me going until lunch . Sometimes I 'd grab- a cup of 3-in-1 instant coffee but had to drink it quick ! There were no microwaves to warm the coffee back up . <p> I had two back-to-back classes from 10:20am to 12:00pm which needed different lesson plans . It was a whirlwind of students and papers and a lot of stairs to climb . <h> 12:00PM Lunch <p> School lunch was served from 11:30am- to- 1:00pm , but my classes did n't  get out until 12:00pm . Lunch usually consisted of steamed rice , a stir-fry dish , a soup or curry , and a dessert . The teachers would line up , grab our- white plastic plates and cheap metal spoons and forks , and wait for the lunch lady to spoon out big ladles of whatever was being served that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school lunch every day because it was free and I 'm not a picky eater. - In fact , Ive eaten several new Thai dishes thanks to school lunches , the most memorable being blood cake . ( Its nearly flavorless and soft like tofu if you 're wondering ) . There was a filtered water dispenser but no sodas , juices , or milk . I did n't  see the point of packing my lunch . It was just one more thing to do in the morning and there was no refrigerator in either the foreign or Thai teachers lounges . <p> Afterwards , every teacher brought their plate over to a trashcan to scrape- their leftovers in . We 'd hand wash our own plates and utensils in a communal sink and put them on a drying rack . <p> Lunch break ended at 1:00pm for the entire school . Any free time after eating was considered recess or relax time . Some days I stayed longer- in the lunch hall to socialize with the other teachers but most often I 'd go- back to my teachers lounge or computer lab to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My small desk in the foreign teachers lounge . <p> My first afternoon class was from 1:00pm to 1:50pm . I had- a new set of faces and the same routine but a different lesson plan . I passed out papers , taught- new vocab , and tested comprehension . <p> From 1:50pm to 2:40pm I had a fifty minute break . Again back to grading ! Because I had so few opportunities to collect grades from students ( I saw them between six and seven times the entire semester ) , I felt that it was- necessary that every class had a worksheet so that I could get enough grades in for a fair assessment of their skills . <p> I need one grade- each for Speaking , Listening , Reading and Writing , and another for Attitude . The worksheet obviously made collecting- reading and writing grades easy . But keeping track of 1,100 individual students speaking and listening skills were a whole different matter ! So- when the students lined up with their finished- worksheets , I used this as an opportunity to give them a- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their paper as they handed it in . <p> The fifth and final class of the day was from 2:40pm to 3:30pm . I 'd usually wrap up the class a few minutes early and then stand up for the teachers song and national anthem . <p> At the final bell , the students would rush out and I pushed the benches and chairs back into order , did a quick sweep of the paper bits and eraser remnants on- the floor , and then I grabbed my papers for the final- climb to my teachers lounge . I put the worksheets in numerical order again , stashed away any worksheets that werent handed back to absent students , and cleared off my desk . Time to go home ! <p> At least once a week I took a nap ( talking , walking and being in the heat all day wore me out ! ) and most days I relaxed after school with a beer . Only one , though . I could n't risk having a hangover the next day , even the slightest one . <h> Reflection on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite Thai assistant teacher , Kru Oy <p> I taught for one year ( two semesters ) and then decided it was n't for me. - Would I have taught- longer ? Yes , if I did n't  have a blog , was single ( or if Chris was also a teacher ) , and accepted a job that paid 25% more with a workload of only 16 classes per- week . <p> On the plus side , this job- helped keep our finances out of the red the first year we were in Thailand- and- I also learned a lot about the Thai teaching culture and saw it as an opportunity to share my experiences with others . <p> I will say , I have a new appreciation for teachers and all the hard work they go through to educate children . This was really an eye-opening experience for me and I have a lot of respect for the people who really are trying to be good teachers and make a difference in childrens lives . <p> If you taught before , what was your typical day as a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised you about mine ? We 'd love to know ! <p> Hi Angela . I am in love with everything about your blog ! I just recently came to Chiang Mai for a research internship and I was wondering where you got your clothes for work or if you know of any places where I could buy office/work/formal clothing like black pencil skirts , collar blouses , etc. ? <p> I am having the most difficult time finding here in markets as they only sell Thai skirts and not really office clothing . Any info would be greatly appreciated ! : ) <p> Love your blog , and thanks for being so honest . I have to admit for a little while I fell into the thinking that " everything was going to be better if not perfect " in Thailand when I go . Your blog helps snap me back into reality . I am a 3rd year teacher in a inner city Dallas school . Yea , its tough but to be honest , might not be as tough as the gig you survived . I 'm hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your experience because I now know what questions to ask before I sign a Read more + <p> Glad you can learn from us . Were still around but decided to become enroll in Thai classes . The original intention was to learn Thai in order to be a better teacher but it just so much easier to be a student ! <p> Good question ! We first moved to Thailand , then I ( Angela ) enrolled in a TEFL course .

A great read and I 'm sure the experience exposed you to parts of thai future that you would n't have otherwise seen . <p> Thank you so much for taking the time to write this . My plan has been to save money and move out to Chiang Mai to teach exclusively young children , as I love being around their energy . But after reading this I realise I have to be a lot more specific with what I 'm looking for in a job I would n't enjoy teaching that volume of students and seeing them so infrequently ! ! Maybe I should consider teaching adults .. Or do you know anything about what is required for an expat to work in a small kindergarten ? xo <p> I think as long as you tell your future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs posted online , you can find a more regular schedule with fewer students and much more frequent interaction . My position was unusual in that it was not for English ( it was an elective course , hence why I taught the entire school ) , and that I knew no better that 24 classes a week was outrageous ! You should have good luck finding a kindergarten position if that 's your calling . <p> Thank you Angela for a comprehensive run through of teaching English to primary school level Thai kids . I do n't  know how you survived the rigor ! ( My 1st carer was teaching high school science in a regular western classroom very tough even back in the 70s ) . Oh one thing , you never mentioned the role of the Thai assistant teacher . Do they teach grammar to the kids , as do the ones in government schools , or are they there to help you in other ways ?

The Thai dress code is so very different , though ! When I showed up in trousers and cardigan , my coworkers wanted to know why I did n't  look more Western , and I realized I was expected to show up in jeans , sneakers and sweatshirt every day to match their American expectations .

@@59574630 @8574630/ <h> Crown Lanta : A Picture Perfect Koh Lanta Resort <p> When we first traveled around Thailand , we were starstruck by hotels with rockbottom price tags . But now , were more often in the market for something more elegant and comfortable for a higher ( yet still reasonable ) price tag . On our recent trip Thailands southern region , the Koh Lanta resort called Crown Lanta did n't  disappoint ! <p> Of course what 's cheap is in the eye of the beholder . Hostels that cost $5 per night have not and never will be a realistic option for us , so around $20 per night is the lowest we 've ever paid in Thailand . But that still meant that we often dealt with creepy crawlies in the room , impossibly hard or sunken mattresses , or a bathroom so dank and dreary that we only went in when it was absolutely necessary . <p> The novelty of that type of hotel has since worn off and now we do n't  feel the need to book those cheaper options available when we travel . Nowadays when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quality , and comfort and not just the absolute dollar amount . <p> So on our recent trip to Koh Lanta , we booked the earliest budget flight from Chiang Mai to Krabi and made it to our destination resort , Crown Lanta , by midday . After landing , we took a two-hour drive in the hotels shuttle van to the northern end of Koh Lanta Yai , which is closest to the ferry . That meant that as soon as we finished our ferry ride , it was just over five minutes later that we arrived at the resort and received refreshment drinks and cool cloths in the lobby . <p> Just look at this amazingness ! <h> Ocean Sunset Villa <p> We walked into a high-ceilinged living room complete with a comfy day bed , a flat screen TV , and a mini bar with two bottles of wine ( first time that 's happened ) ! We distinctly remembered the rooms freshness and brightness . The glass French doors on one side opened up to our own private lounge area on a deck overlooking the Andaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was beautiful . And spotless . Well even go so far as say immaculate . We ended up getting great sleep there , too , as the bed and pillows were super comfortable and it was very quiet at night . <p> Even our spacious bathroom had a window that allowed small glimpses of coastline if we peeked past the foliage . There was a rain shower and plenty of fluffy towels , nice smelling soaps , and washcloths . Brownie points for that last bit ! <p> A cool feature of the room was the two-sided closet . We 'd hang up our clothes and everything was accessible from both the bedroom and the bathroom . Its worth mentioning that we also had extra bottles of drinking water ( two is standard ) , especially because we drank so much water on this trip because we were out in the sun all day . <h> Grounds <p> The grounds of the Crown Lanta had nice , tropical landscaping but were hilly . This was n't a problem though because there was a dedicated team of drivers that carted guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it took us to grab our sunglasses and slip on our shoes , a cabby would arrive to pick us up from our room and drive us to wherever we wanted to go whether it be the lobby , pool area , spa , or restaurant . <p> Actually , before we chose to stay at this particular Koh Lanta resort , we read reviews about it and the biggest complaint seemed to be about the hilly walk around the property . But seriously , that 's what the drivers are there for ! And the drivers were on top of their game . Not once during our stay did they take more than a minute to arrive after we called the front desk . <h> Crown Reggae <p> Aside from relaxing in our room and on our private oceanfront deck , our favorite hangout spot was the Crown Reggae . This was the resorts outdoor bar situated on a rocky coast with the perfect view of the sunset . We spent two evenings there enjoying snacks and drinks with great company and watching the sun go down in brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit : we could have chosen the front row view on Thai style cushions on the beach near tiki torches , lounged under a thatched roof , chilled at tables under a few string of lanterns , or our personal choice , enjoyed cocktails in the treehouses . The kid in us loved this feature ! <h> Pool , Spa , and Gym <p> Check out this crystal clear outdoor pool with a swim-up bar . There was plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas , and some of the rooms even open up directly to the pool . <p> Crown Lantas Infinity Spa , while pricier than your standard roadside foot massage , had several private rooms and even a jacuzzi . We enjoyed two back , neck , and shoulder massages here , but if we had wanted to , we could have gotten massages outside on tables like these below . <p> And although we had every intention of using Crown Lantas gym , we ended up spending our time doing less work and more play while on the island . <h> Restaurants : The Peak and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally seek out in a hotel is the featured breakfast . Beginning with endless flow of fresh drip coffee ( thank you for not serving that instant powdered stuff ) , Crown Lantas The Peak served up an amazing complimentary breakfast that included mini Belgian waffles , homemade yogurt , fresh breads , and made-to-order omelets . There were Thai foods as well , but our hearts were set on the Western fare during this trip . <p> And especially after our really late night out at the Crown Reggae the night before , we were happy to see some freshly blended fruit juices as part of the breakfast spread , perfect for flushing our system with much-needed antioxidants . <p> Lunch at the outdoor Cliff Restaurant was also yummy . The menu featured mostly standard Thai dishes , but the presentation was much nicer than anything we found at nearby street stalls and matches the quality wed expect from a high-end resort . Although it might not sound like anything special , the fish cakes and the accompanying dipping sauce were out of this world . <p> A photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec 13 , 2015 at 7:01pm PST <p> One thing that stood out was Crown Lantas wonderful hospitality . From the time we were picked up at the airport to the time we checked out of our rooms , the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . Everything was so hassle-free : our airport pickup , booking a motorbike rental , requesting a driver pickup from our villa , and ordering food and drinks . The staff really made us feel welcomed and we felt well taken care of . That 's not to say we normally receive bad service , but the Crown Lantas staff really seemed to go above and beyond . <p> here 's a quick list of Crown Lantas amenities : <p> Restaurants open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Seafood buffet on Friday evenings with fire and Thai dance show . <p> Amply stocked bathroom with towels , soaps , and toiletries ; great shower pressure and temperature <p> Stunning beach views from multiple areas of the property and rooms <p> Weve got to hand it to Crown Lanta for its quality and comfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suitable for some travelers , but we definitely recommend this resort to those who are looking for something a step above the rest while visiting Koh Lanta . <h> Contact Information for Our Favorite Koh Lanta Resort <p> The Crown Lanta is a popular place to be during the high tourist season ( November through April ) , but that 's all the reason to visit during the low season . In fact , the low season is our favorite time to travel because you can almost guarantee that the price of any resort , guesthouse , or even bungalow on Thailands islands and beaches are nearly half the cost in low season as they are in the high season .

Afterwards , you can hail a motorcycle taxi back home . Have fun ! <p> Hi , its best to carry your passport and an international drivers license with a motorcycle endorsement while operating a motorbike . We got ours in the US from AAA for about $20.00 . In some instances the police have been happy to see a valid motorcycle license from our home country . However , most of the time motorbike rental shops only want to see your passport and any type of valid license ( any type ) from your home country , so at the end of the day it is up to you to follow the law .

Going back and forth is too much bouncing around in our opinion . Hope this helps . <p> I am planning a trip to Kho Lanta ( staying at the Crown Lanta ) in late May . I was wondering if you would be able to give me some insight as to how the weather is like in late May . Also since I would be traveling there during the low season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other islands ? <p> Its the start of the wet season , but since May is the first month of that season , its generally still relatively dry . As in , you may have a handful of days where it rains for several hours . Otherwise itll be generally hot and sunny . Transportation to other islands will be limited since the boats will shut down for the off-season ( May-November ) . There is less demand for their services because of the lack of visitors but it is also because the water gets choppy throughout this time of year .

@@59574631 @8574631/ <h> Som Tum Thai : Green Papaya Salad <p> The abundance of fresh ingredients is ever-present in Thai cuisine . A popular Thai dish that showcases fresh vegetables is som tum Thai ( a+aa+a+a+aa+a+ ) or green papaya salad . This is one of our personal favorites and can be found anywhere in Thailand , from restaurants to food stalls . <p> A sweet , salty , tangy sauce made of sugar , lime juice , and fish sauce completes the dish . It can be easily altered by leaving out an ingredient or two ( no shrimp for vegetarians ) , but do n't  be afraid to try it in its original form . <h> Some Like Som Tum- Hot ! <p> This dish can be served quite spicy . Vendors typically have a bowl of hot chilies to add and the customer can request how many chilies they want . It may take a little coaxing to get the vendors to put in more than one chili for Western customers . We usually get two or- three chilies . <p> Som tum talae is seafood papaya salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squid , and mussels <p> Som tum mamuang is green mango salad <p> Som tum khao poht is corn salad <p> Tum daeng is cucumber salad <h> How to Eat Som Tum <p> Eat- som tum- by itself but its better with sticky rice , which is served in small plastic baggies . Take a ball of rice the size of a quarter , make a slight indent with your thumb , and use it to pinch or scoop up the papaya salad . We recommend eating som tum with sticky rice because it cools your mouth and allows you to mop up the sauce . <p> We enjoy pairing it with skewers of grilled chicken. - Som tum is so popular and easy to make that it seems almost every family , restaurant , and food stall has their own special recipe .

That gives us the heebie jeebies . Maybe a second chance is in order while its still sunny ? It really is delicious : ) <p> It is definitely one of our favorites from the various food stalls around . And like you say , you can make it as spicy as you like . The vendors always raise an eyebrow when I ask for it with 3 or 4 chilies . They usually watch me eat it and are amazed that I like it and do n't  run for the moat screaming and yelling . <p> Hahah !

@@59574636 @8574636/ <h> 12 Amazing Things to Do in Chiang Mai <p> Weve lived in Chiang Mai for a few years and have tried- hundreds of- places in- and around the Old City . Whether you 're into culture and food , pampering yourself , or into exploring what the nearby mountains have to offer , here are some of our favorite things to do in Chiang Mai . <h> 01- Go to a Thai- Cooking School <p> Thai food features an incredible balance of sweet , spicy , tangy , and salty flavors . Conveniently enough , many Thai dishes can be easily prepared even by the most novice cook. - Although there are dozens of Thai cooking schools in Chiang Mai , our experience at Best Trip Cooking School rocked . Our instructor is temporarily taking a break from teaching , but her friend at Asia Scenic Thai Cooking School- comes highly recommended . <h> 02- Eat at the North and South Gate Food Stalls <p> Want to try Thai street food ? The food stalls at the Chang Puak ( north ) and Chiang Mai ( south ) Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find but they offer a great variety of Thai dishes , too . From stir-fries to curries to vegetarian food , fruit smoothies , and Thai desserts , this is a fun and easy way to sample- Thai food on a budget . <h> 03 - Walk Among the Clouds <p> If you want to spend some time in the outdoors and experience some breathtaking views , visit the Doi Inthanon National Park . About an hour and a half drive from Chiang Mais Old City , the national park is home to Doi Inthanon , Thailands highest mountain . There are temples , flower gardens , waterfalls , caves , and stunning hiking trails . Make it a day trip or spend the night in a Thai styled bungalow . <h> 04 - Shop in Extravagant Malls <p> Cool off in the air conditioning- and meander through any one of Chiang Mais malls . Featuring movie theaters , familiar Western brands , and a great selection of international food options , we recommend checking out just how spectacular the- MAYA , Promenada , or Central Festival Malls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably give your malls back home a run for their money . <h> 05- Take a Temple Tour + Monk Chat <p> Chiang Mai Old City has over 300 temples . Although we 've only been to a fraction of them , we think Wat Sri Suphan and Wat Umong are among the most stunning . Wat Sri Suphan is the only temple in Thailand made entirely of silver and located less than one kilometer- south of the Old Citys square moat . Wat Umong is peacefully situated- in shady groves and moss-covered brick caves about two kilometers- directly west of the Old Citys square moat . <p> Another favorite of first-timers is Wat Chedi Luang . Its in the heart of the city and offers a unique service chatting with local monks ! <h> 06- Learn About Northern Thai Lanna Culture <p> In the heart of the Old City is the Lanna Folk Museum . Converted from what was once- an old royal residence , rich art displays offer insight into the colorful Lanna culture of the northern Thai people. - Spend an hour browsing there and then hop over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more . <h> 07- Enjoy High Tea in the Thai Country <p> For a unique East meets West cultural experience , try dining on English pastries and tea surrounded by beautiful Thai surroundings . Treat yourself to an afternoon enjoying a variety of muffins , scones , other sweets , and finger sandwiches in addition to several coffees , teas , and juices . The prices - A perfect balance of sweet and savory . The Dhara Dhevi , Four Seasons , and Anantara are three beautiful places to try . <p> Any guide book will mention getting a Thai massage as one of the top things to do in Chiang Mai . The luxury treatments and spa packages are so affordable here that its hard to pass up the opportunity to pamper yourself . Treat yourself to a facial or aromatic oil massage at some of Chiang Mais finest spas such as De Chai Spa , Oasis Spa , and- Fah Lanna Spa . Theyll cost a fraction of what youd typically pay in other countries . <p> On the other end of the spectrum , try a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops on Loi Kro Road ( across the street from the Raming Lodge ) that offer a satisfying 30-minute foot massage or back and shoulder for less than 3- USD . As an added bonus , you can enjoy a cool evening breeze and- people watch as patrons from the nearby bar and club scene meander down the road in your direction . <h> 09- Play With Elephants <p> One of the most memorable things to do in Chiang Mai is spending the day with elephants . Our experience at the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary- was captivating , soul satiating , and unforgettable . Its one of the very few elephant parks in Thailand that treats their elephants humanely ; there 's no riding , no tricks , and no performances !

We follow each other on Instagram too ! Love this blog post . I have been invited to a Thai colleagues wedding in Chaing Mai in January and I am looking for things to do on the saturday ! the sticky water fall climbing and the elephant sanctuary look great ! thanks so much for the great ideas ! : ) x <p> Hi ! Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai mid-December and I 'm unsure about visiting Doi Inthanon Park . Is it a good time of year for it ? Photography is a hobby of mine and I 'd like to get great photos but I do n't  want to waste my time if its likely the weather wont cooperate or there will be excessive crowds . Is it worth the visit at all , regardless of weather or crowds ? We have only a few days there so I need to pick and chose our activities carefully ! <p> That 's the same time we visited Doi Inthanon last year . ( You can read more about it in our post here ) . It was gorgeous . The skies are so clear and there 's almost no chance of rain ( its the dry cool season ) . We saw about a dozen people on the nature trail , which is where we thought the photos were the best . But overall it was n't crowded at all the most people we saw were probably 25 or so at the Twin Pagodas . Well worth it ! <p> I 'm travelling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and your tips are just perfect . we are only there 5 days and I think you 've covered it . My daughter really wants to see Long Neck tribe ! What do you think .. worth it ? We thought of hiring Scooters for day out roaming around . Can you recommend a Bike hire ? And Thank you for your info . i especially am looking forward to the Live Jazz bar . We are coming from Seychelles and looking forward to buzz of chiang Mai <p> So glad this post is helping you on your upcoming visit to Chiang Mai ! Its certainly possible to see/do all of the things on this list during your five days in town . As far as visiting a Long Neck Hill Tribe , from what have heard from others is that its not worth making a special trip to go see them . Instead take a group or private tours that includes a visit within the itinerary . Some visitors enjoy seeing the women and take photographs with them and buy souvenirs to help support their community . Other visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so helpful ! Do you have any hotel/lodging recommendations while in Chiang Mai ? Also while I 'm asking , are there any resorts you recommend in Phuket ? Trying to go for New Years but it seems many are booking up quickly during that time ! Thank you ! <p> Absolutely ! For starters , what 's your budget like , would you prefer to be in or out Chiang Mais Old City , and do you want something Thai or Western style ? As far as Phuket , we do n't  have any recommendations because we have n't spent enough time there but we do know of some fantastic resorts on Koh Samui if you 'd prefer that . Our friend Linda at onyxthailand.com can hook you up with breathtaking villas , perfect for celebrating New Years ! <p> Just enjoyed the video of your walk home ! Hope to visit Chiang Mai for 1st time arriving during last week of Sept.and stay about 7 days ( travel alone ) . Question : What is the air quality likely to be at that time of year ? Although I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does NOT require any meds to control . Other wise Im exceptionally healthy and fit for age 77 . Is late Sept. likely to have blue skies often to enhance photography ? <p> The air will be super clear and the skies will be a gorgeous robin egg blue perfect for amazing photos ! If you 're looking for more things to do , we 've designed week long Chiang Mai itineraries that may be perfect for your schedule . Have a wonderful time ! <p> That 's very kind of your auntie to take you abroad ! Cambodia will definitely be a rustic experience . It is much less developed than Chiang Mai ( or Thailand in general ) and has a few main touristy sites to visit . Chiang Mai is easy to navigate on your own with things to do and places to go everywhere you look . Have fun on your trip whatever it is you chose to go ! <p> Would you recommend Patara Elephant farm ? My husband and I are thinking of going to Chiang Mai Feb. 2016 and have been doing my research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the elephants , is that correct or what other place would you recommend ? <p> No , we do n't  recommend Patara Elephant Farm because it allows riding . A we mention in this post , we recommend going to the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary or Elephant Nature Park where you do not ride the elephants at all but still get to play and feed and bath with them . Hope you have fun at whatever place you choose ! <p> Just done the thai cooking school today and I have to say its one of the best and nicest experiences I 've ever had , they are soooo wonderful there at Asia Scenic , and talk about value for money ! Cheap as chips compared to bangkok . Generally speaking this article has been a great help for my time in Chiang Mai and I just wan na say thank you very much for this and you other articles , you 're both what we call in Ireland " gooduns " . sounds low key , but it really means your right up there with the best of them ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time later this year ! ! Looking forward to all the excitement offered in Chiang May and still have to decide which islands ! ! ! So so excited ! ! Want to experience all that we can ! ! ! <p> Do n't  forget for tea try The Celedon Tea House on Thapae Raod and Love at First Bite just over Narawat Bridge 1st or 2nd on the left . Also please remember that Thapae Road is one way up to the gate and you can not go down to the river etc.instead use Loi Kroa . Thanks for an inetresting site . <p> Some fab ideas , I did a few but not all of them while I was there a few years ago . I 'm so glad I educated myself about the downsides of Thailands elephant tourism before I went the nature park was an unforgettable experience ! <p> Greeting ! ! Glad to know that you have a great time staying in our country : D Do n't  miss a chance to take a drive to the top of Doy Inthanon in winter time . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are welcome to ask me . I will help to find answer for you : D <p> Hi guys , my wife and I love your posts .. If you get the chance and your in Hang Dong ( behind Makro ) there is a little restaurant you guys have to try .. Its called Eakkanak , its a family owned place with GREAT FOOD .. Very inexpensive and a real large menu too . When my wife and I were there in CM a few weeks ago on vacation , this place is right at the entrance to our development ( How convenient for us LOL ) . We ate lunch and dinners there almost every day , SOOOO Good . Try it !

@@59574638 @8574638/ <h> iTravel Channels Eat Asia in Chiang Mai <p> I was recently presented with the opportunity to partner with the iTravel Channel in the makings of Eat Asia , an online video- series about food . I had the pleasure in accompanying food enthusiast , Natalie Scarr , around Chiang Mai to cook and eat khao soi , a Northern Thai yellow curry noodle dish . Here 's a look into what went into the making of the Eat Asia in Chiang Mai episodes and my first experience in the film industry . <p> I could n't have been more thrilled to be asked to work with the iTravel Channel as they filmed their Eat Asia episodes featuring khao soi in Chiang Mai . Anything that involves food , especially Thai food , count me in ! <p> Eat Asia is a new travel series featuring an up-close look at various Asian cuisines . The nine episode series features three special dishes that are each popular or well-known for in three different cities in Thailand . <p> So why was I in the film ? I , along with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this popular Northern Thai dish . Khao soi is one of my favorite Thai dishes , and I had caught the iTravel Channel 's eye with the short review I 'd written on the dish awhile back . <p> We had a great time filming over two days . In the first episode , The Origins of Khao Soi ( Watch it here ! ) , - we went to the market with a chef from a luxury resort . She taught us about the ingredients that go into makings of the dish . <p> Whether khao soi is cooked at a quaint establishment or a luxury resort , the ingredients of the addicting yellow coconut curry broth and the egg noodles come straight from the local markets . <p> Natalie was amazing to work with , both on and off the screen . She is the perfect host for Eat Asia energetic , enthusiastic , and charming . I 'm flattered to have been asked to be a part of this series . Be sure to stay tuned for the next two Chiang Mai episodes due out on- September 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wait to see what the future hold for the Eat Asia series . <p> Hello lovely couple , just found your blog and had a look at the first video- sadly episode 5 is no longer on their site .. I reckon you could do this kind of thing yourself Angela . You 're so photogenic ! Hope things are going well for you and absolute kudos for trying to learn Thai . Tonal languages are impossible ! ! And I seem to recall from my short time there Thai actually has about 14 tones ? ? ? : ) <p> Thanks ! We have a few videos on YouTube but have n't quite found that sweet spot of time vs quality . Weve liked what we 've made so far but theyve required too much work ; we rather put that effort into other projects . <p> Awwww , Thai is n't *that* hard : ) Sure , it takes extra concentration to learn the tones ( five ) . We think the best thing to do is learn how to pronounce the word and its tone correctly the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " variations " so you can tell the difference ) . With a good Thai teacher its definitely possible ! <p> i see the Universe is giving you boosts ha : ) it does that when people are clear on their goals and continue every day moving towards their dreams . I am so happy to hear things are going well for you guys congrats on that fun adventure and surely more to come : ) <p> the best khao soi in Thailand is in the small town of Thaton on the Burma border about 3 hrs north of CM , it is to die for . I almost stayed there just for the khao soi and havent found anything even close in CM but will keep looking . 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574639 @8574639/ <h> Thailand Packing List : Expats and Slow Travelers <p> There are tons of packing lists available for the world traveler , but what do you include in your Thailand packing list- if you have big plans to move there ? here 's a guide to packing not only the essentials , but things that are particularly helpful as you settle into your new home . Youll be happy to learn what you can find in Thailand once you 're there , so you can pack ( or not pack ) what you see fit . <h> Clothing to Include in Your Thailand Packing List <p> Let 's be honest . Who 's really content with wearing the same few outfits ? We 're not ashamed to admit that we like variety in our wardrobe . We also do n't like being obligated to do laundry every other day . We packed about ten shirts and five bottoms each , which worked well for us . <h> Womens Thailand Packing List : <p> TIP : Stick to clothes that are lightweight , fast drying , and moisture wicking . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded , stained , holey , forever wrinkly , or in general disarray . <h> Shoes to- Include in Your Thailand Packing List <p> We recommend packing one pair each of the following : <p> Lightweight tennis shoes ( if you are active ) <p> Dress shoes ( for evenings out ) <p> Flip flops or slip-on sandals ( for everyday wear ) <p> While you decide which everyday shoes to add to your Thailand packing list , it 's best to choose shoes that are waterproof , breathable , and easy to clean . We recommend leaving behind those that are made of cloth , or are white or light-colored . Since the heat will cause your feet to be puffier than normal , toss any shoes that are- slightly snug or unable to stretch . <h> Additional Clothing <p> Bring a favorite bathing suit and a cover-up ( sarongs are great ) if you plan on going to the beach . Sunglasses are cheap and available anywhere , as are hats . <p> Thailand 's coldest months are in December and January . After months of scorching hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of each of these- warm weather items- in your Thailand packing list ( you 'll thank us later ! ) : <p> Leggings or linen pants <p> Pair of jeans <p> Socks <p> Lightweight jacket or windbreaker <p> Long sleeve cardigan or nice lightweight sweater <h> Where to Buy Clothing &amp; Shoes in Thailand <p> In case you need to buy clothes or shoes in Thailand , a local outdoor market is the place to go . There are plenty of comfortable and stylish pieces of apparel for sale for under $10 USD . Keep in mind that market clothes are made for smaller , more slender frames . <h> Mens Sizes <p> Lean build up to 510 " ( 1.8 m ) <p> Shoes sizes up to US 11/Euro 45 <h> Womens Sizes <p> Slim build up to 56 ?

Clothes here are more expensive ( $10 to $20 USD per item ) . Trendy shopping areas and super malls have familiar brands like Oakley , Nike , and Guess , but expect to pay Western prices ( $50+ USD ) . <h> Important Papers to Bring <p> Many Thai offices require original paperwork to file for documents like visas , work permits , and Thai driver 's licenses . In most instances , a copy will not suffice , so bring originals of the following : <p> Passport <p> Social Security Card ( or equivalent ) <p> Drivers License and International Driver 's License ( if possible ) <p> Birth Certificate <p> Marriage Certificate <p> Diploma/Transcript ( if you plan- to work ) <p> Make sure to have your account numbers and passwords of bank , retirement , investment , and credit card accounts ( particularly those that are overseas friendly ) . <p> If you have medical needs , bring any prescriptions you want filled ( health , skin , or beauty ) and a copy of your medical history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Electronics to- Include in Your Thailand Packing List <p> Contrary to what you may think , electronics are n't  usually- cheaper in Thailand . Bring- these items if you have them : <p> Unlocked GSM phone ( AT&amp;T and T-Mobile carriers ) . CDMA phones ( Verizon , Sprint , Cricket , and several other carriers ) can not be unlocked and , therefore , will not work abroad . <p> Kindle , iPad , iPod <p> Laptop/external drive/case/mouse <p> Camera or video equipment <p> Electric razor , hair dryer , hair straightener <p> Plug adapter and converter <p> All necessary chargers , batteries , memory cards , etc <p> TIP : You will not need a converter to charge your phone or computer . However , you will need a converter if you bring a hair dryer , electric razor or hair straightener . Of course , you can always toss your old grooming tools and buy Thailand-friendly replacements at an outdoor market . ( Theyre expensive at indoor stores . ) <h> Pack Your Favorite Toiletries <p> Pack your favorite toiletries but put them in smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in tossing it if you know you 're going to use it . <p> Face wash , SPF face lotion <p> Body lotion , sun lotion <p> Deodorant <p> Small shampoo , conditioner , and body wash <p> Toothpaste , small mouthwash , floss <p> Small shaving cream , aftershave , hair oil <h> But Youll Still Find What You Need in Thailand <p> We eventually found appropriate substitutes for our skin and hair care products after we moved to Thailand . Thailands Wal-Mart-like super stores carry a few familiar brands like Colgate , Herbal Essence , and Neutrogena . They have a great variety of soaps , lotion , sun block , face powder , and deodorant , but many are laced with skin whiteners . <p> Things you can get for cheap in Thailand , but may still need immediately : <p> Insect repellant <p> Bar and Hand Soap <p> Hand sanitizer , wet wipes <p> Over-the counter medication <p> Small padlock <p> Dry bag <p> Poncho <h> Should I Pack Heirlooms and Keep-Sake Items ? <p> We did n't  bring keep-sake items with us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft x 1 ft x 2 ft and left it with our parents , but any close friend or relative would have worked . We recommend you doing the same . <h> Organized Packing and Travel Kits <p> Things can get quickly disorganized after tossing everything into one big piece of luggage . We found that by investing in travel cubes ( we used eBags Packing Cubes ) we were able to keep our belongings organized and easily accessible . We also grouped smaller items together into kits . Of course this is optional , but we still used these kits at home and whenever we travel around Thailand . <h> Thailand Packing List Items- That Make- Settling in Easier <p> Inevitably , there will be a few items that you do n't  know what to do with . While purging your place and deciding what items to add to you Thailand packing list , think about this : <p> We kept a West Elm duvet cover ( $120 ) with a small tear , near-full bottles of cologne and perfume ( $150 ) , and bamboo-cotton blend hand towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these in Thailand ? Similar items , yes . But why get rid of them for pennies only to buy them again at full price ? <p> First offthank you for offering this wonderful information . My girlfriend and I are planning to move to Chiang Mai later this year and are finding your many articles invaluable . <p> One question I have is whether you would suggest buying dress clothes ( slacks , shirts , ties , etc. ) back at home or waiting until we arrive in Thailand . Will they be cheaper in the States or in Chiang Mai ? ( You said the clothes in shopping centers are more expensive , but I was n't sure whether you meant they are more expensive than at the markets or back in the States ) <p> Glad we can help ! The clothes in the shopping centers are more expensive than the markets . Most of the shopping centers showcase a lot of name brands , so if you typically shop for expensive branded clothes , youd probably pay the same as back home . However , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you know you can hit up a two for one sale at a department store , we recommend doing that before coming here simply out of convenience . Malls also have some more affordable non-brand dress clothes shops , but depending on your size , you Read more + <p> Thanks for linking this article in your e-mail reply to me , Angela . Super helpful information and we already have practiced a lot of the tips above because like you said , the more you travel , the better you get at packing just what is needed . Looking into the Crocs ballet flats that you recommend.thanks again ! <p> BLU sells dual SIM unlocked quad band Android GSM phones ( I got the Advance ) in the US for under $100 so you can use one phone for both your US and Thai numbers . <p> Also , of the US carriers , you can keep a T-Mobile number active for 1 year even if you do n't  use it with their prepaid account at gold status ( have paid $100 in refills ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your smart phone like with the other carriers . No worries about losing your US number and no contract necessary . <p> Thanks for the clarification . Checked baggage is definitely the way to go , or well wait til a family member comes and have them bring a suitcase . Amazon has 5,000 watt transformers that run $160 $200 USD and weigh 30 40 lbs . for anyone else that might be looking . Smaller are available but the risk is not worth the savings IMO . <p> Our first visitors from the US saved some room in their luggage and brought us a few things , which was awesome . We heard the more powerful voltage converters were heavy , but we did n't  know they weighed as much as a small kid ! <p> Hi all , I hope someone will have some insight .

Thank Read more + <p> You will need a step-down converter since American appliances run on 110V/120V and Thailand runs on 220V/240V . First check if your kitchen appliances are dual converting ( 100V240V ) or single volt ( 120V ) . If they are dual converting ( our iPhone and laptop are ) you can plug them directly into the wall with no problem . However , if they are single volt , like an electric razor , they need a voltage converter . You will need a powerful converter for kitchen appliances .

However , older Verizon phones ( models before 2014 ) are limited to CDMA capabilities , and so they can not be unlocked and used in Thailand . Its good to see Verizon is finally offering this option ! A great summary can be found here . <p> I just reread this entry and the subject of spices caught my eye . Were there any spices that you simply could not find ? How about sauces and such ? We like to cook and while we like to eat out , we would probably want to cook some home favorites from time to time : ) <p> In Chiang Mai there is a chain called Rimping , which is much like a Whole Foods in the US ( we assume there 's one in Bangkok but have never been ) . It has great cuts of imported meats and sausages , pastas , jarred sauces , canned beans , dairy foods , and spices ! Although there are huge chains ( Tesco Lotus , Big C , Makro ) that carry a good amount of western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more unusual items ( like apple cider vinegar with the " mother " , or quinoa ) .

Non-whitening deodorant can be found at the international store we mentioned called Boots . I think were really lucky in Chiang Mai because we have several international stores ( even a grocery store ) that carries a lot of the same products as back home . The brands might be a little different , but I think we 've eventually found everything we 've needed . We cant say the same about the small cities in Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " must haves " . <p> That is a great list Angela and Chris ! Every time I went to Thailand I did so during a world trip and the result was that I had way too many heavy , warm clothes on me that I had to carry around . It seems you also like to bring a few more clothes than absolutely necessary , even if Thailand is the perfect place to buy clothing . Especially some of the t-shirts I bought were cheap , light weight and lasted forever : ) <p> Thanks , Dennis . Certainly if you do n't  have much hot weather clothing , you can definitely find lightweight clothing here . As for the heavy , warm clothes , we wish we had some during last winters 8 degree cold spell ! ! Brrr ! It really depends on the time of year you visit , and that kind of apparel is hard to find ! <p> I always bring lots of raw almonds and or some cashews as the prices here are terrible and the nuts last a long time , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper there than here and larger size clothes r hard to find here . Good info thanks . <p> Haha , well be looking at razor prices back in the US too , and possibly stocking up ! Weve gotten some good deals on peanuts and cashews at the outdoor markets ( non-special packaging ) . But you 're right , they 're expensive in the stores ! <p> Its definitely very helpful and these packing tips can be used for any Asian country I guess , especially China . To be honest , I am hopeless at packing and if I could , I would take my fridge and microwave with me , but I 'm learning to pack as lite as possible when heading to a new country ! <p> You , hopeless at packing ? ! We do n't  believe it : ) The bottom line is that Asian countries are pretty well connected to the western world and in most cases you can find what you need or a really good substitute . <p> I 've had this piece of luggage for years , actually . I had to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal wear and tear , great zippers , expandable , the retractable handle works smoothly . It even comes with a small lock and key to deter prying fingers , and a bag strap if you want to clip a second small item to it . Overall , very happy ! I would recommend buying in color other than black , or in my case red , as those seem to be the most popular ! <p> I bought my bath towel at Lotus and it was $10 . That 's too much . $30 for a bed set with pillows but no sheet . If you wear reading glasses buy several at the dollar store . I could not find cheap ones here and it cost me $90 at the optical store ( they saw me coming ) . For photo buffs you can have pics developed in minutes for 2-5 baht depending on the store . Bug spray is a must . <p> Yes , in all honesty we were quite shocked by the prices at Tesco Lotus . We have since learned that you can have bed sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hunt for quality towels though ! We did n't  want to deal with eye glasses or contacts abroad , so we opted for a good deal on Lasik Surgery back in the States before we moved . Thanks so much for the great info , Roger ! <p> Great list for a long term installation . For a small trip ( 7-45days ) , the challenge is to avoid buying too much in Thailand . Thus I recommend to just spare some money the months before your travel and carry an empty suitcase . You will be able to buy clothes of the highest quality for a third of the Western price . Take into account that Thai wont have any winter clothes as there is no need . T-shirt 4-7 USD , Girl shoe 7-15 USD , Shorts 5-12 USD My advice is to take the good quality if there are t-shirt at 4 Read more + <p> You 're right being more choosey about what you buy and go for the higher quality will always end up with better results , even in a place as affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt just because its $2 ! Bringing an empty suitcase is also a great tip that we practice whenever we travel . Thanks ! <p> You 're welcome ! Its hard not to over pack , even with things like clothes . And you 're right , the more you travel , the more you learn what 's truly useful and what you could have left behind . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 2 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

We had dinner at a restaurant right on the corner and even celebrated with a bottle of champagne . <h> #2 - Red Lotus Sea in Udon Thani <p> We took a trip to Isaan , Thailands northeastern countryside , and visited the amazing Red Lotus Sea . Located just outside Udon Thani , this- lake is home to millions of palm-sized red lotus flowers . So many , in fact , that slow chugging boats have carved paths through the dense flowers much like roads . <h> #4 - Chiang Mai Flower Festival <p> Chiang Mai hosts a flower festival each February that features many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental floats . We stopped to take a picture and- captured four people taking pictures of themselves . This goes to support the rumor that Thailand is the selfie capital of the world . Poor grandma , she- does n't  look like she approves ! <h> #5 - Bua Tong Waterfalls <p> Nestled in the Mae Taeng National Forest Reserve- north of Chiang Mai is one of the coolest natural attractions weve ever been to . Also known as the Sticky Waterfalls , we seemingly defied the laws of physics climbing up- several tiers of non-slippery rocks as water cascaded down around- us. <h> #8 - Longtail Boats at East Railay Beach <p> When the tide comes in , - East Railay Beach transforms itself into a picturesque cove complete with longtail boats and limestone cliffs . We have come to love these boats and think of them as a symbol of Thailands beaches . <h> #11 - Vegetarian Festival in Bangkok <p> During an impromptu meet up with our pals Mick Shippen and Richard Barrow , we stumbled upon a huge parade in downtown Bangkok . It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , men doing acrobatics , and dragon costumes galore . <h> #14- Sunset in- Krabi <p> We loved how the rays stream our from behind the clouds during this sunset in Krabi .

It is now home to four elephants , two of which are a mom and baby pair . After romping around and eating some bananas , we caught this little guy- getting a snack from his mom . <p> Always nice to hear from you guys . I love the photos and I love what you guys are doing .

@@59574641 @8574641/ <h> The Battle Against Thailands Bugs <p> Chris hates spiders. - I- hate cockroaches . So before we moved to Thailand , we never believed that one day we would actually live in harmony- with- these creatures . Not go into a kung fu frenzy at the sight of one , you say ? Since- having our fair share of surprise encounters with them over the past two years , we 've learned how to handle Thailands bugs and- other creepy crawlies without getting too freaked out ! <p> We love that Thailand has a warm and tropical climate . We love that Thai- businesses are , more often than not , open aired . We love outside dining and enjoying a good meal or a cup of coffee under the shade of a few trees . We love- the simplicity and quaintness of Thai styled teak houses . <p> But with all that comes a very inviting environment for Thailands bugs . This includes things that fly , creep , and jump . Well even throw in four-legged creatures that skitter around in the night . <h> Ants <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ants are by far the thing- that gives us the biggest heartache . <p> In our first studio apartment , we could n't get them rid of them . We 'd empty the trash daily . We 'd wiped down counters and do dishes immediately . We even started putting our dry goods , like oatmeal , sugar , and noodles in zip-lock bags , but the ants would chew through the plastic and get in anyways . <p> The ants even went so far as to eat our toothpaste . Theyd march from these little cracks in our bathroom walls and ceiling , up the sinks , and- weasel their way under the toothpaste cap . It was disgusting . <p> Also , ants give nasty bites ! I found- welts the size of- silver dollars on my body that stayed blotchy and itchy for about a week , and it was n't from some mutant mosquito . Who knew a tiny thing- could do so much damage ? ! <h> Cockroaches <p> Big ones and small ones . Daytime and nighttime . These things are afraid of nobody ! <p> Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) outside and- either digging in the roadside trash or cruising along the sidewalk . Its usually- just one lone rider , but more often than not , it- measures over two inches long ! <h> Spiders <p> We see small spiders from time to time , and admittedly , we think our cat properly disposes of them at night or while we are away . <p> But let 's just say that we were never ready for the type of spiders we had in our old townhouse . They were sporting a wingspan of nearly- three inches and were lightning fast . <p> We killed ( dog eat dog world , we know ) several of these gigantic grey spiders in just one month during what we assumed to be spider season back in- our old townhouse . <p> Weve- used- roach spray to stun one- into submission before whacking it with a broom . <p> Another time , I was putting in my contacts and saw a- spider splayed on the wall less than a foot away from my cheek . I flung my contact across the bathroom out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before it skittered- off . <p> The worst experience was finding one of these spiders on top of our bed . Now were in a predicament ; we did n't  want to squish it on the pillows or blankets , but we did n't  want to risk losing it in the bed frame , either . The bed frame was a big box on the floor with enough wooden slats supporting the mattress that you could barely fit your fingers between them . <p> Unfortunately , the latter happened , and it was right before bedtime . <p> We know what you 're thinking. - Did you go to bed knowing the spider was in the bed frame somewhere ? - Yes , why yes we did . We had the heebie jeebies but we just couldnt do anything about it . That 's ok . Two days later , that spider got what it deserved . <h> Millipedes <p> Weve seen some mighty millipedes in Thailand . These guys get- several inches long and are as thick as a pinky finger , but were happy to report that they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them outside and hope to keep it that way . Sealing our doors has prevented any millipedes from wandering into our house and being eaten by the cat . <h> Mosquitoes <p> Mosquitoes are present year round but in varying degrees . There are more in the wet season ( July to October ) and fewer- in the dry hot season ( March to June ) . They love cool dark places , like- your typical jungle and shady outdoorsy areas . But this also includes- underneath restaurant tables and in bathrooms , which- give the perfect opportunity for biting fleshy areas . <p> A word of caution , Thailands mosquitoes can carry Malaria and Dengue Fever . Although there are preventative pills that can be taken for Malaria and often used by tourists , these are not a long-term solution for people living here. - There are no vaccines against these diseases . However , symptom for Malaria and Dengue Fever are treatable ( lots of fluids and pain killers ) at the local hospitals . <h> Frogs <p> We have n't seen too many frogs in Thailand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a week or two of frog plagues , which we captured in a- time-lapse video . Hundreds of these- miniature- buggars hopped out of the temporary pond in our side yard and made our patio area their home ! <p> We 've also rescued our neighbor and her sister from a frog in their house. - They- were terrified of a- palm-sized frog that was sticking to their- living room wall , so we knocked it off with a broom and put it back outside where it belonged . <h> Lizards <p> We have two types of lizards that frequent our house and surrounding yard . The locals call them jing joke- and dtook gae , but we call them geckos and email protected you lizards . The latter has been given this nickname by foreigners who believe the lizards call sounds much like said- expletive . <p> The geckos frequent our home and hang out on the ceilings . They seem harmless , make cute little chirps , and supposedly eat mosquitoes . Theyre good guys , so we do n't  bother them . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The other lizards look like small iguanas and can be aggressive . Weve known someone whose large dog tried to mess with one and got a nasty bite on the nose that required a visit to the vet- and antibiotics . Do n't mess with these guys ! <h> So How Do You Get Rid of Thailands Bugs ? <p> There are several preventive measures you can take against Thailands bugs , as well as ways to get rid of them once they 're inside the house . <p> Something as simple as sealing the gaps between the doors and the floor prevents larger bugs and- other critters from getting inside . Thai houses are n't  typically built to Western standards and are rather , um , breezy . We found door seal strips ( weathering strips ) at our local HomePro , a home improvement store . You may also have luck at the big department stores , like Big C or Tesco Lotus . <p> Using caulk to patch up small cracks will also help prevent smaller bugs , like ants , from coming inside . <p> Ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied- often . Draw- lines around door and window frames , electrical sockets , and pipes using this special chalk . It has a neurotoxin that interferes with the ants ability to track food sources and follow scent trails . It also kills those that are exposed . <p> Other tips including- cleaning up immediately after cooking . Rinse dishes before putting them in the sink and wipe the counters- to get rid of small spills and crumbs. - Also , put dry goods into tupperware or glass containers . <p> As far as spiders and roaches are concerned , they either get a blast from insect spray or they 're electrocuted- the electric bug zapper racket. - The latter is also fantastic for- killing mosquitoes . And can we all admit how fun it is to hear the rapid- pop-pop-pops when you 've successfully killed them ? - These items are available at 7-Elevens , Mini Tesco Lotuses , and those little dollar store equivalents around town . <p> Wear long sleeve pants and shirts , weather permitting , in the evenings and mornings . Even wearing full coverage shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Use mosquito repellent. - 7-Elevens and Mini Tescos , which are scattered across every block in Thailand , sell sprays and lotions . They smell a lot better than the stuff that contains Deet , too . <h> Thailands Bugs Do n't  Stop There <p> We 've also had a brief encounter with a dead scorpion in our bathroom drain , had an infestation of these weird grey worm pods on our walls , - witnessed several- plagues of flying termites , dealt with ticks , and have seen plenty rats . Snakes ? Nope , we have n't seen a snake yet . <p> Weve since gotten used to Thailand 's bugs . Well , as much as one can get used to things that swarm , bite , jump , and fly . Would you be able to do the same ? <p> Hello Friends , As I plan for my visit I 've heard that food grade Dicameous Earth is sure to support keeping pests away ( rubbing on the family kitten , spreading in cabinets and along floor corners and window sills even under clean bed sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of you tried this yet ?

Never heard of it ! How interesting worth looking into if Chiang Mai has stores that sell it . The best defense for these critters is to stay in a home that is properly sealed ( windows , screens , doors , roofs , etc ) . It makes a world of a difference if you stay in a Western style house vs Thai style ( open to the elements ) . Home you make the leap soon ! <p> Hi gf and i are moving to chiang dao later .. currently in chiang mai . and i found this interesting .. now as to the diatomaceous earth .. i used this as the filtering agent in my swimming pool , filter and pump .. so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? .. <p> We had a big problem with ants in the kitchen , they just seemed to pour out of every crack and crevice . Tried various poisons but the only one they actually fell for was ARS , it comes with a sachet of poison and and refillable plastic holder , they happily marched back to their nest with it , and that was that . <p> I 've lived in Thailand ( Bangkok , Srisaket and Mahasarakham ) and Oahu Hawaii definitely more roaches in Hawaii ! ! ! I 've also had a bigger problem with rats when I lived in more rural areas of Oahu . But Bangkok is a real mosquito heaven !

Theyve had fevers , skin rashes , and pain in their eyes , palms , and soles of their feet . It lasted about a week . Its unrealistic to think that people living in Chiang Mai wear tank tops and shorts year round .

@@59574642 @8574642/ <h> Nature Beach Resort in Koh Chang , Thailand <p> We have to admit , we felt pretty lucky after randomly stumbling upon the Nature Beach Resort in Koh Chang . Little did we know that staying at this resort turned out to be the best decision we could have made for an awesome and relaxing vacation on one of Thailands islands . For a mere 35 USD a night for a beachfront bungalow , we 'd recommend this to anyone who 's visiting Koh Chang . <p> As seasoned travelers , accommodations play a big role in making us happy during our trip . We usually stay in places that cost around 30 or 40 USD a night and look for something clean and simple , with hot water , but with a certain level of conveniences . <p> Koh Chang has a wide selection of accommodations from backpacker huts to high-end beachside resorts . All the really nice looking resorts we looked at online were going for 50 USD or more . <p> We were in for a big surprise when we stumbled across Nature Beach Resort during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bungalows from the road and decided to take a look . Fifteen minutes later we had a key to our room for the next four nights . It turned out to be the best decision we could have made . <p> We were totally impressed by its design , on-site restaurant , and unbeatable beachfront bungalows . The Nature Beach Resort is home to about fifty bungalows of varying ages and amenities . They are clustered among palm trees and tropical plants and run right up to the beach . The resort is incredibly clean , lively , and provided us with a relaxing yet fun retreat and easy access to the gorgeous beach nearby . <p> We loved sprawling across the large bed with big fluffy pillows and comforter after a day at the beach . There 's a narrow table that 's home to a flat screen TV and a small recessed area to hang clothes . With the dark curtains open , plenty of natural light streams in and when closed they offer complete privacy . And there 's an AC unit pointed right at the bed . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are only equipped with a fan and no water heater . During the low season ( April through October ) , these go for 450 to 550 baht ( 15 to 18 USD ) per night , with a garden or beach view , respectively . <p> There is also a family suite , with two bedrooms and two bathrooms , that rents for 3,500 baht ( 115 USD ) a night . <h> Bathroom <p> Walking directly to the other side of the room is a set of frosted glass doors with homemade wooden locks that open into a very spacious bathroom . It sports a clear glass sink and a huge mirror with recessed lighting . The roof is opaque , making the bathroom even brighter than the bedroom . We liked that the bathroom has two screened areas above the toilet and the shower that allowed a refreshing cross breeze . <p> Fresh towels , shampoo , conditioner , and bars of soap are provided on a daily basis . Our bungalow was equipped with a hot water shower , but we only wished the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare to do a Matrix backbend to get your head under the spout ! <h> Nature Rocks Restaurant <p> The Nature Beach Resort has its own restaurant called Nature Rocks , which is open from 7:30am to 10:00pm . They serve a variety of both Thai and Western meals for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . The food was great and we ate several meals there that averaged a total of 300 to 400 baht ( 9 to 12 USD ) . There are plenty of tables for small groups of people and the tiered design of the restaurant floor allows all diners to have a great view . <p> Each morning we woke up and happily took only a few dozen steps before seating ourselves for breakfast overlooking the water . We managed to enjoy the gorgeous view each morning by ourselves since it seemed that most hotel guests did n't  roll out of bed until past 9:00am . <p> For breakfast , we recommend the banana and coffee mixed smoothie and banana pancakes . Evidently , banana pancakes are a pretty hot item in Koh Chang ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nature Rockss chili and basil stir-fry with seafood ( pad grapraotalay ) is delicious . If you are looking for Western food , their cheeseburger is really good , too . <p> The restaurant also has two more beach front decks with short tables and small cushions to sit on . Either is a perfect place for drinking beer or fruit smoothies , or for laying back and watching people walk by on the beach . <h> Night Life <p> Nature Beach Resort made it easy to hang out there in the evenings . Nature Bar has a small bar area and dance floor that are right beside the restaurant . We loved the mix of reggae and beach music that constantly flowed from the speakers . Three nights in a row they even had several fire dance performances . <p> When we wanted to go out , a ten-minute walk took us to Lonely Beach where there are plenty of bars to hang out at . We had to be careful though because the road is a bit dark at night and there is no shoulder or sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant is an outdoor massage shop where massage services are provided in an open-air shaded room with a fan . Guests can relax on beds facing the beach . To allow everyone a view , there are no privacy curtains . The masseuses make sure to cover you up appropriately when getting a massage and ladies can keep their bathing suit top on . <p> We were able to walk right up without appointments and both get head , neck , and shoulder massages . For 300 baht each . On the beach . In a tropical paradise . It does n't  get better than this ! <h> Service <p> Our bungalow was quite close to the beach , which also meant it was near to the restaurant . Even though music and bar activities were a short distance away , the sound of music and flow of guests walking by our room did not keep us up at night . <p> The cleaning staff did a great job cleaning our room , providing extra water on request , and getting every last bit of sand we brought in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all areas of service were excellent . Our unscheduled check-in was received smoothly by the receptionist and the restaurant staff was particularly friendly and attentive . The resort staff also did an excellent job maintaining the property , picking up trash , cleaning tables , trimming plants , sweeping leaves , etc . <h> Nature Beach Resort Amenities <p> Restaurant open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ; Western and Thai <p> Optional water heater and air conditioning <p> Laundry facility ; toiletries for sale near lobby <p> Massage shop <p> Snorkeling and kayaking rentals <p> Excursion booking <p> Wifi available in lobby area <p> Queen size bed ; additional bed available on request <h> Suggestions <p> Wifi is not available in the rooms- but it is available in the lobby and restaurant areas free of charge . However , we noticed it was not password protected , so if you are working with sensitive information or pictures , use with caution . <h> Overall Stay <p> The Nature Beach Resort went above and beyond our expectations . We loved that it satisfied our needs for food , entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was an amazing place just to sit back with a fruit cocktail and relax . <p> It had everything we needed , and when we wanted to explore another area of town , we could easily get a taxi . There are several different areas on the island each with a different vibe and good nightlife . When we vacation in Koh Chang , we will be sure to come here again ! <h> Location and Contact Information <p> The Nature Beach Resort is on the southwest side of Koh Chang Island , just north of Lonely Beach . An immediate right turn exiting the hotel leads to Lonely Beach and the downtown area with convenience stores , clothes shops , bars , and restaurants , and an ATM . The walk is approximately 10 minutes . <p> Chris &amp; Angela , I have a quick question regarding check-in procedures at the Nature Beach Resort .

Your phone is not unlocked if it only accepts certain sim cards . I have actually never heard of a stateside phone that was unlocked being able to take only certain kinds of Thailand sim cards .

I 'm just curious at this point in time , but will still check to see if it is unlocked or notand what the " real " price would be for something like that . <p> I had AT&amp;T as well . I unlocked my phone through a seller on eBay . I had to give him my IMEI number and pay about $4 . He/she remotely unlocked it in about 3-5 days ( cant remember exactly ) .

@@59574645 @8574645/ <h> A Beautiful Koh Lanta Snorkeling Experience <p> We have n't gotten our open water PADI certificates to scuba dive , so we do the next best thing : snorkel . Weve gone on several snorkeling adventures within the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea , but our most recent one has turned out to be our favorite to date . In fact , while we were searching for the best Koh Lanta snorkeling spots during our last trip down south , we stumbled across the little island of Koh Rok just off Thailands southwestern coastline and ended up checking it out . It couldnt have been prettier ! <p> Weve gone snorkeling on three other occasions in the Andaman Sea but none of them had the wow factor as did our latest trip to Koh Rok . <p> Koh Rok is actually two tiny sister islands called Koh Rok Nai ( inner island ) and Koh Rok Nok ( outer island ) directly south of Koh Lanta . Since its not a place that 's easily accessible on your own , we went with a tour company called Opal Speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , of which three hours were dedicated entirely to snorkeling across three different dive sites . The rest of the time we spent blissfully cruising around the open water with the wind in our hair and exploring one of the most picturesque beaches we 've been to in Thailand . <h> Gorgeous Fish and Coral <p> Check out these sea creatures ! After picking the last tour guest , we cruised for another 45 minutes before stopping at our first snorkeling spot off Koh Rok . We hopped off the back of the speedboat with our underwater camera gear and immediately began pointing out several varieties of fish , coral , and other creatures to each other in the clear , warm water . Our expectations were a little low because during our last trip snorkeling in the Andaman Sea we saw little more than rocks and sea urchins in semi-cloudy waters , but snorkeling off of Koh Rok turned out to be amazing ! <p> We saw parrot fish , anemone fish , groupers , and angel fish ( several kinds of each ) . We even spotted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which species we saw with the help of a handy laminated cheat sheet our tour guide whipped out for us . <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Jan 29 , 2016 at 3:47am PST <p> At our second dive site , we saw clown fish . Hey Nemo ! These were our favorite fish to photograph because they let us get really close for pictures ( less than a foot away ) ! Instead of fleeing when we approached , they would nestle in the nearby anemones knowing we would n't get too close because they can sting if you touch them . <p> We saw many other fish but some were just too fast to get a clear picture of . We also saw sea urchins , sea slugs , Christmas tree worms , and brain coral . They stood out brightly against the deeper browns and blues of the sea floor . <p> TIP : The snorkeling sites are only two to three meters deep . If you are comfortable diving down , the coral and fish look really amazing up close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After two rounds of snorkeling , we took a break for a buffet lunch on Koh Rok Nai near the islands ranger station . We were given about an hour to eat and lounge on the beach . While we ate at the picnic area , there were several huge Monitor Lizards moseying about . It was n't hard to see why : they were after the food scraps from the tour groups buffet lunch ! Although they got pretty close to us , they were definitely more interested in the chicken bones left behind than the tourists themselves . <p> Its difficult to tell , but this Monitor Lizard is about a meter long ! <p> After a quick lunch we had the option to either walk up to a viewpoint on the tiny island or wander down the beach . As it turned out , Koh Rok Nai is one of those picture-perfect beaches you see on postcards . Its sand is nearly white and its water is a gorgeous aquamarine . The sand is also ultra fine and we distinctly remember how soft it felt under our toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , we might just opt out of the last snorkel spot and relax on Koh Rok Nai . The beach was so pretty and when we walked a minute or two away from the picnic area we had the beach all to ourselves . In fact , some of the families with younger children on our tour stayed here while the rest of us went to the third reef . Afterwards the boat came back and picked everyone up before heading back to Koh Lanta . <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Dec 19 , 2015 at 1:09am PST <p> While we walked along the shore we kept seeing little rocks move . On closer inspection we found several dozen hermit crabs skittering around in the sand . <h> Koh Lanta Snorkeling with Opal Speed Boat <p> Snorkeling is just one of many things to do on Koh Lanta and there are several tour companies providing this service . Opal Speed Boat was recommended to us and we had a great time during our snorkeling trip with them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met us at the beach nearest to our resort on the northern tip of Koh Lanta . The boat made several stops along the west coast of the island , picking up other guests as we made our way southbound along the island . <p> Our boat was full but not overbooked ( we went during high season ) but it was spotless and there was enough room on the padded benches to be comfortable . The equipment and life vests were clean and the guides were friendly and professional . Heck , we even sat down with one guide and he showed us exactly where the snorkeling spots were on a map . <p> The pace was perfect . We visited each dive site for about 50 minutes and did n't  feel rushed when it was time to get back in the boat . The guides also did a good job of looking out for members of our group who strayed outside the boats safety zone . You have to be careful of other speedboats driving by in the area . <p> Our snorkeling experience was on Koh Rok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amazing place go there ! Unfortunately , we do n't  have a recommendation for a beach on Koh Lanta with good snorkeling : / <p> Thanks for sharing this we are in Koh Lanta now . Unfortunately , the sun got to me but my husband is on a 4 island excursion . I think coming here in January would be much better . The islands are beautiful and we have been on many beaches that we had all to ourselves . Truly breathtaking . <p> Ive been on this same exact tour with Opal 3 times , 2013 , 2015 and just last month 2016 . And I have had a wonderful time each and every trip . Its worth it to watch the weather to try and hit a clear day . We snorkle with long sleeved lycra tops and apply sunscreen to the backs of our legs often ! And after a day of snorkling , sunset drinks at " the Indian " bar on Klong Dao beach ! <p> Oh wow , three times ? ! They must be doing something right : ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin . We saw the Indian Bar while we were there last time . Thanks for the recommendation well try it out the next time we go . <p> Thank you ! When we opened the photos up on our computer for the first time , we could n't believe the quality of some of the shots . Some were so clear it was unreal . Definitely added Koh Rok snorkeling to your list of things to do when you finally make it to Thailand . Absolutely worth the trip ! <p> You are making us totally jealous with this post . Koh Lanta is a fabulous Thai island ( our favorite ? ) . Just the right mix of buzz and peace-and-quiet . Not too developed ( yet ! ) . We were pampered at the Pimalai Resort and we 'd love to go back : - ) . And we also spent a day scuba diving <p> We had drinks at the Pimalai their Coconut Dream is to die for and probably our favorite tropical drink ever .

@@59574646 @8574646/ <h> Ten Things Were Glad We Brought <p> As we sold our belongings on Craigslist a few months before leaving for Thailand , we figured we did n't  have to sell everything . While we are n't  going to bore you with the entire list of contents we managed to fit into each of our three bags , we did want to highlight some of the items that came in super handy at the very beginning of our move to Thailand . In addition to about ten shirts and five pairs of shorts ( and skirts , for Angela ) , unmentionables , and toiletries , here are a list of other important items . <h> Ten Items We Are Glad We Brought to Thailand : <h> 1 . Wine Key <p> Not those complicated contraptions found at Brookstone or Williams Sonoma , but the traditional ones that servers and bartenders use . In our case , we are happy to be able to open our 45 baht ( $1.50 ) large Chang beers or to crack open a bottle of imported red wine for spaghetti night . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rack ) <p> A great alternative to putting our soap bar , pumice stone , and razor on the shower floor <p> This has come in handy at hotels and guest houses <h> 4 . Medical Bag <p> We have already used pepto , ibuprofen , hydrocortisone , wet wipes , bug spray , antibacterial gel , and sunblock in the first ten days of arrival . All of these items were in our old medicine cabinet , travel-sized , and unexpired . There was no point in throwing them away only to repurchase in Thailand ( albeit , cheaply ) . We definitely have no regrets bringing these items . <p> You never know when you may need a first aid kit <h> 5 . Crocs Shoes <p> We never thought in a million years we 'd own a pair of Crocs , but we each purchased a pair right before we moved to Thailand . These shoes are incredibly comfortable , are surprising breathable , and have kept our feet covered and clean . Additionally , they actually look pretty good on . <p> No jokes <h> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having straps on either shoulder offers extra security that your bag wont fall off mid-ride on a mo-ped . Plus , the man of the team can carry it , too . <p> Great for carrying things around the city <h> 7 . Travel Laundry Bag <p> You know , the kind that pops up ? Its ten times better than a plastic bag , and folds down next to nothing when its time to travel . It makes you feel less like you are living out of a suitcase , and well , more like you are living at home . <h> 8 . Towels <p> Of the four hotels we stayed at during our initial stay in Thailand , all four of them lacked wash cloths , and two of them lacked hand towels . Once we moved into our new apartment , we had NO towels of any kind . We brought bamboo-cotton blend wash cloths and hand towels , but the REI bath towel we brought was compact , super absorbent , and fast drying . <h> 9 . Laundry Drying Line <p> Until you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't realize that it is impossible to fit an entire load of laundry ( in our case , two ) onto a typical-sized drying rack . The AAA drying line we brought is made of two lines twisted together so that no clothespins are required to hang clothes . <p> Nice little setup of ours that has really come in handy <h> 10 . Hanging Cloth Shelf <p> Not a single place we 've stayed at since being in Thailand has been equipped with a dresser . All we 've had available are standing wardrobes , so the handing shelf came in really handy and gave us more organized vertical space for our folded clothes . <p> These make for such great use of limited space <p> What are some items you would bring , or have brought on your travels or moves ? <p> If you are a woman , have size 9+ feet ( US ) and want to work as a teacher , bring your own shoes . Even in Bangkok it can be challenging to find shoes suitable for work larger than size 8/8.5 . Thais seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1979 , but it seems that their feet remain stubbornly less than Western-size . Bigfoot strikes again : - ) <p> Exactly ! We mentioned women can wear up to a size 8 in our Thailand Packing List post , so its good your experience is the same as ours . Although clothes can be tailored , finding hand-made shoes is nearly impossible ! Luckily , amazon.com does ship to Thailand ( for an extra international shipping fee ) . <p> We 've never tried , and we do n't  know of the Thai equivalents for eBay/amazon/etc . We used to be big online shoppers , but since moving here weve really cut back on consumerism . It looks like Amazon will ship to Thailand for an additional ( up to ) $5 , $14 , and $25 per shipment for standard , expedited , and priority courier shipping . At least its possible if you really need something ! <p> let us know before we come visit if you want us to bring anything ! We have free shipping with amazon prime , plus access to a commissary ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix and american spices ? <p> I may need to start making a list ! There have been a few things we cant seem to find like hair clippers . As for brownie mix , there are no ovens here ! but you can bake a batch before you come over : ) : ) : ) <p> haha We remember this feeling . Realising that you might perhaps have to repurchase a lot of the stuff you 'd just got rid of . But I must say you 've come pretty well equipped to have thought of a suction rack !

@@59574649 @8574649/ <h> Visiting Ao Nang , Thailand <p> A trip to Thailand is n't complete without a trip to the gorgeous southern beaches . A four-day visit to Ao Nang , a town that makes up part Krabis Andaman coastline , proved to be a satisfying mini vacation in the sand and sun . Here 's a taste of what we found in this relaxed beach town . <h> Ao Nang Beach <p> Ao Nang Beach has a beautiful view of the nearby islands and the moored long-tail boats along the coastline . For those who want to sunbathe , there are nearby downtown shops and restaurants conveniently accessible throughout the day . <p> In the early evenings , the tide retreats quite far along the gently sloping coastline . As the tourists head back to their hotels to rinse off the sand and sunscreen , the local seafood vendors take this opportunity to hunt for clams in the exposed shoreline . It is a beautiful sight to take in . <p> There havent been too many moments that we have enjoyed more than the evenings we have sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nang Beach and watched the Andaman sunset . It is in these moments that we truly realize how fulfilled we are in the lifestyle we have chosen . <h> Downtown Ao Nang <p> Although touristy , this town is still relatively small , clean , and has a good choice of things to do beyond getting some sun . The main strip runs about a half kilometer along the Ao Nang Beach . Ao Nangs downtown area is full of lively beach shops , restaurants , bars , massage parlors , and travel agencies . <p> Restaurants offer a decent selection of cuisine , ranging from seafood to pizza to Indian , and of course , Thai . There are several low-key bars , and we even spotted a Burger King and an H+agen-Dazs ice cream shop . As with any touristy town in Thailand , there is no shortage of Thai massage parlors . <p> There are also plenty of excursions available while visiting Ao Nang . These can be booked through the small travel agencies that are dotted along the strip . Some local activities include rock climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nearby beaches and islands . Try to book a day in advance since many of these tours leave early in the morning . <h> How to Get Around Ao Nang <p> We recommend using public transportation if you are staying in downtown Ao Nang . Tuk-tuks are available for a flat rate of 30 baht per person . Unless you 've snagged a resort near the main strip , you 'll have to walk up a hill to get back for the evening . After a long day at the beach , a tuk-tuk is a welcomed alternative to some serious inclined walking . <p> As an alternative , hail a songthaews . Although we did n't get a chance to check on the price , they are generally cheaper than tuk-tuks . <h> The Best Time to Visit Ao Nang , Thailand <p> In our experience , the best time to visit this small tourist-friendly beach town is in October , just before the high season . During this time the beaches and islands are n't  overly crowded , its not too hot , and the clear blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay half price on most hotel and resort stays if you book outside of high season . <h> Map Ao Nang and Points of Interest <p> Ao Nang is easily accessible by public bus ( 150 baht per person ) , private taxi ( 600 baht ) or private shuttle van ( 800 to 1,200 baht ) from the Krabi International Airport . Tickets can be purchased at counters before exiting the airport . <h> Hotels in Ao Nang <p> One of our favorite hotels in Ao Nang in called Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa . Nestled near the cliffs in a rain forest setting , it has a huge pool , free breakfast , and bungalow style rooms that are really one of a kind . <p> Hello , we are in Chiang Mai presently and wanting a beach experience .

@@59574651 @8574651/ <h> Telling Family Youre Moving to Thailand <p> Telling family you 're moving to Thailand can be an overwhelming endeavor . It was n't always the case that our families supported our decision to move to Thailand . However , a healthy dose of planning and persistence helped us gain our families support to live the life we wanted in Thailand . here 's how we did it . <h> 1 . Start Early <p> If you are dreaming about moving to Thailand , do n't  hesitate to share with your closest friend and family the things that make you get the butterflies . Its never too early to talk about Thailands amazing food , diverse city and country- life , and the beautiful sites , even if it still feels a bit unattainable . The great thing about starting early is that there is n't much pressure in when or how you end up telling family you 're moving to Thailand . Conversations should flow easily and be laid-back and lighthearted . <p> For us , it felt right to start talking with parents and siblings about a year before we wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual , bringing up Thailand whenever we took a weekend visit to Angelas parents house . About a dozen conversations on the porch with a few drinks in hand worked well for us ! <h> 2 . Start Small <p> Plant the travel seed , not a tree . Before telling family you 're moving to Thailand , why not mention vacationing there ? In fact , images of Thailands beautiful beaches and lush rainforests may have your family thinking to themselves , " Why do n't  we do that ? " <p> Taking baby steps gives friends and family time to warm up to Thailand , especially if they do n't  know much about it . Your fun but short vacation can naturally evolve into a longer and rejuvenating sabbatical . Its hard to argue with the idea of taking a few months ( or even a year ) off of work to de-stress and focus on self-improvement . <p> We first mentioned taking a one month vacation to Thailand . We gradually increased the length of our trip to a few months . Eventually , we felt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it took us. <h> 3 . Share What Life Could Be Like in Thailand <p> There are thousands of world travelers documenting their experiences online . Show your family picture and videos that showcase the beauty of Thailand , provide current news reports , and send them online articles of monthly budgets of people who currently live in Thailand . Let them see and hear what it 's really like . Make it real . <p> Once your family sees life abroad through another traveler 's perspective , it may be easier for them to visualize you traveling . They can envision you being happy , healthy , and safe in Thailand after seeing someone else who has done the same . <p> Whenever our family had questions about what life could be like in Thailand , we always had pictures , videos , or articles readily available . Some of the most exciting moments we had together were showing our family photos and videos of Chiang Mai and seeing their reactions . <h> 4 . Put Your Familys Worries to Rest <p> Are they uncomfortable with the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Are they afraid that you are putting your financial security in jeopardy ? <p> Do they feel you are missing out on long-term investments such as buying a house or contributing to a retirement plan ? <p> Are they offended that you are not following in their footsteps or living a life they define as normal " ? <p> Are they upset that you are unable to help with family affairs while abroad ? <p> Do they worry that you will miss out on family time in general , or that you may never permanently move back to your home country ? <p> After telling family you 're moving to Thailand , show them that you care about their feelings just as you would want them to care about your feelings about moving abroad . Letting them talk about their worries gives you a better understanding of why they may be anxious or upset . It also gives them the chance to come to terms with their own fears . <p> While Chriss family wished him the best in his travels to Thailand from the beginning , Angelas family did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best to anticipate her familys questions and- had answers to how we would retain financial stability , handle safety and health , and stay in touch while abroad . By steadily showing them how prepared we were , we slowly put their anxieties to rest . <h> 5 . Tell Them That You Want Their Support <p> After telling family you 're moving to Thailand , they may or may not ultimately agree with your decision . However , we hope that you encourage your family to support your decision because this is something that will make you happy . <p> Too many people in this world worry about making other people happy to- the detriment of their own happiness . We wholeheartedly urge you to follow your dream. - This applies to everyone and everything ! <h> Telling Family Youre Moving to Thailand is Worth it <p> We wanted to live a non-conventional life in Thailand , but it was important for us to have our family on our side . For those who want to take a similar path , getting over that hump of telling family you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever do . In the end , its well worth once youve finally taken those first steps in your new home . <p> There are n't  many things better than to move to Thailand , and in doing so , inspire your family to make the trip out to visit you .

@@59574653 @8574653/ <h> Trip to Pai , Thailand : Eat , Sleep , Repeat <p> Whenever we meet new people , they are surprised to hear that we are actually living in Chiang Mai and not just visiting . Oddly enough , the conversation always seems to lead to the same follow-up question : Have you taken a trip to Pai ? <h> Weekend Trip to Pai , Thailand <p> Pai , as we later found out , is a beautiful yet incredibly tiny mountain town a few hours north of Chiang Mai . We finally took a three day trip to Pai to see for ourselves why it is revered by so many travelers . From our short experience there , Pai will be in our memories as the place where we enjoyed an incredibly relaxing vacation . <p> Many people traveling in Thailand find themselves drawn to Pai because of its easy going atmosphere and small town feel . Particularly popular among backpackers , Pai also has many natural , slow-paced activities such as yoga retreats , trekking , mountain biking , fishing , hot springs , and popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture that can be seen and heard as you walk around Pais small downtown area . <h> Recommendations For Our Trip to Pai <p> A big reason why we took a weekend trip to Pai is because several friends and followers shared with us stories and places that will always make Pai special to them . These stories inspired us to make the trip to the tiny mountain town . Here are a handful of the best recommendations we received . <h> 01 Pai Chan Cottage &amp; Cuisine <p> In between our visits to the Pais main street and our drive exploring the outer limits of the tiny town , we enjoyed the most relaxing weekend of our lives . Our bungalow at the Pai Chan Cottage &amp; Cuisine backed up to a spectacular view of rice fields and mountains in the distance . We opened the entire side of the bungalow facing the mountains and let the cool breeze roll in over us as we dozed off into our many frequent afternoon naps . <p> Our good friend Bee of Be Beez Cafe &amp; Guesthouse in Chiang Mai booked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We had n't  any idea where to stay so she took it upon herself to make sure we had a great time . We slept like babies knowing it only cost us a mere 450 baht ( $15 US ) a night ! <p> Angela and our friend Bee and the view from the poolside Bungalow in Pai she booked for us ! <h> 02 Tiks Kitchen <p> We were already thinking about eating our way around Pai before we even left Chiang Mai . Shortly before we took off on our motorbike trip to Pai , one of our readers sent us his story and we decided to follow-up on the places he recommended . We were glad that we did . <p> It was a heartwarming experience and fun to explain to Tik that we were visiting her restaurant and sending her " hellos " from family back in the States . Connections like these make you realize that our world is pretty small after all . We definitely recommend trying her Northern Thai style cuisine . If you are looking for a cool casual place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar right around the corner . Tik will make sure you know exactly how to get there . <h> 03 All About Coffee <p> UPDATE : All About Coffee has closed its doors since our visit in September 2013 . <p> All About Coffee was high on our list of places to visit during our trip to Pai and came highly recommended by our expat friends , J and Sacha from 8 Miles from Home . They visited All About Coffee eight years ago on their round the world trip and this was one of the places that inspired them to move to Thailand . There was no doubt in our minds , we had to go and experience it for ourselves ! <p> Our friends say it was All About Coffees brownie that made them move to Thailand <p> We enjoyed lunch at the 140 year old house-turned-coffee shop and made friends with the owner , Wat . The house is well taken care of and is home to an eclectic collection of wall art and crafts for sale . Were always thankful when J and Sacha point us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know them and look forward to taking a trip to Pai with them one day soon . <h> 04 Nas Kitchen <p> Our fellow travel blogging friends , Ryan and Liz from Pause the Moment , highly recommended Nas Kitchen as the go to restaurant for some of Pais best Thai food . Knowing that share the same love for good food , we had no choice but to take them up on their advice . <p> We were the last customers to walk into Nas Kitchen as the restaurant was closing up shop for the night . Feeling bad , we told Na that would could come back tomorrow , but without hesitation she ushered us in with a smile and a " sawadee kha " . Soon after we were seated , we enjoyed two delicious curry dishes and her highly acclaimed spring rolls . The food was full of flavor and heat , and her quaint little restaurant was the perfect place to enjoy an evening feast . If it was n't already passed closing time we would have ordered a couple more dishes ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make it to Nas Kitchen . Thanks again guys ! <h> Total Cost For Our Trip to Pai ( 3 Days and 2 Nights ) <h> Is it Worth Taking a Trip to Pai ? <p> It may seem obvious , but yes , of course a trip to Pai is worth it in our opinion . <p> We especially recommend it if you are living in Chiang Mai . The " downtown " areas extremely laid back vibe , variety of restaurants , street food , and coffee houses offer for a relaxed , yet fun nightlife . <p> On our last day we sipped coffee and watched a rain storm slowly make it way through Pai <p> With the picturesque views of the countryside from its many tucked away guesthouses , Pai is an excellent place to come if you simply want to disappear for a while . Feeling a little burnt out in Chiang Mai ? Taking a long weekend in Pai may be exactly what you need to get away , relax , and recharge your batteries .

@@59574659 @8574659/ <h> For Those Who Prefer Cold Showers <p> Thailand is HOT . Now that we have rolled into April , we barely get a break from the heat , and that 's even at night . When we first arrived in March , at least we looked forward to opening the windows to let in the cool , 60s-ish evening air . <p> But that is no longer the case , and even in the mornings we wake up and its hot . And after going about our daily business we are hot . And after we get home from riding around outside we are hot . Can you see a trend here ? <h> That is where a nice , cool shower comes in . <p> Two shower heads one is adjustable for the hot water , and the other is cool water <p> Never did I think that I would regularly use the traditional Thai cool-water shower , but I do .

Hot water comes from individual heater units installed in the showers themselves rather than hot water supplied to the entire house from one big tank .

@@59574661 @8574661/ <h> Taste Testing Five Unusual Thai Snacks <p> The other day we were feeling a bit goofy , and might we add , curious . So we went into our local 7-Eleven and instead of walking past the prepackaged Thai snacks like we normally do , we decided to do a bit of a taste testing experiment . Why not- try out some typical , but none-the-less , unusual Thai snacks ? Here 's to being guinea pigs ! <p> We do n't  typically indulge in prepackaged salty and sugary snacks like the ones were about to , but we got a- wild hair and thought wed give them- a try . After all , they are nearly impossible to- ignore while browsing the aisles of- Thai convenience and grocery stores . We tried picking out ones that would be unusual to our American palettes but nothing too crazy to the point we found them- unappetizing ! <h> Sweet and Spicy Squid Seafood Snack <p> These seafood strips were , in our opinion , easily the most unusual Thai snacks . It- looked as if someone pureed squid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew a tight zig-zag along a cookie sheet , and then baked it . <p> Cost : Two 1 ? x 3 ? strips cost 5- baht ( $0.17 USD ) <p> First Impression : The snack felt tacky to the touch and was pretty stinky . The first bite proved to be too sweet . Bleck ! Sugary squidy seafoody flavors do not mix well . And then there was a punch of spiciness . It was a little chewy , definitely sticky , and a bit stale tasting , too . <p> The Verdict : Although this seems to be a popular snack with children ( Angela remembers seeing her students happily gnawing away on these chewy sticks ) , they are n't  quite made for our palette . We 'd rather eat freshly grilled squid . <h> Big Sheet Seaweed <p> You know the strips of seaweed used in sushi ? Greenish black and paper-thin , these fried seaweed snacks were instead rolled out into flat single serving sheet . They are light and airy but are n't  as brittle as they look . They actually bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller pieces . <p> Along with the Original flavor , these snacks feature non-scary BBQ flavor . But there are Garlic and Grilled Squid flavors , too . <p> Cost : One 3 ? x 4 ? strip cost 10- baht ( $0.35 US ) . <p> First Impression : Light as air , these fried seaweed snacks quickly- dissolved in our mouths like- Cheese Puffs . They are full of flavor , which can best be described as a slight meaty ( umami ) with a fresh ocean taste . And you know how Doritos leave delicious orange dust on your fingers ? Seaweed snacks do the same thing , only with little black crumbly flakes of goodness . <p> The Verdict : Were big fans of this seaweed snack , and to be honest , have enjoyed them long before doing this experiment . Seaweed strips are full of flavor and satisfying salty snack . We just used this experiment as an- excuse to buy some . <p> Our only disappointment is that they are hardly filling and there seems to be more packaging than product , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferring- the packaging- featuring the anime figure resembling Cartman from South Park . Its that or bags featuring K-pop stars . <h> Shrimp Ginger- Lime Chili- Flavored Lays Potato Chips <p> Thailands Lays potato chips have familiar Western flavors like Original , BBQ , and Sour Cream &amp; Onion . But there are also more unusual flavors like ( Maine ) Lobster , Shrimp , and Nori Seaweed . We got a kick out of the international flavors like Italian Cheese , Mexican Burritos , and British Ham . Yes , British Ham . <p> We could n't figure out the translation of the flavor , so were just going off the pictures on the package , which featured shrimp , ginger , lime , and chilies . <p> Cost : One bag for 20 baht ( $0.60 USD ) <p> First Impression : The chips look harmless , but they packed a- sour limey punch uppercut . So much so that we could n't taste the ginger , or shrimp , or even the chilies . In fact , the sourness distracted us from any spiciness at all ! <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . But maybe those who- like salt and vinegar chips will enjoy this unusual flavor . <h> Durian Chips <p> Fresh durian is an unusual Thai snack in itself . This- tropical fruit is infamous- for stinking to high heavens , often being described as having the sickly sweet smell of an onion beginning to go bad . But for this snack , the fruit has been dried and package in a ( presumably ) - less smelly manner for customers convenience . <p> Cost : One bag for 49 baht ( $1.65 USD ) <p> First Impression : If you told us this was a potato chip with a light coating of salt and sugar on it , we 'd believe you . There was no evidence , in taste or smell , that this was made of durian . The bag smelled like fried sweetness , with no hint that it was made of fruit , vegetable , or root . It was actually quite enjoyable . <p> The Verdict : If we were craving something with a sweet salty combination , this would be a good choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also happens to be the most expensive snack out of the group . <h> Pandan Cake Roll <p> Other than being radioactive green , this cake roll resembled the classic- American Hoho . Although neither of us can remember the last time we had one of those snacks , we do like pandan , which is a leaf used to flavor several traditional Thai desserts . The- best we can describe pandan flavor is that of an earthy jasmine smell and taste . <p> Cost : 12 baht for one roll- ( $0.40 USD ) <p> First Impression : We were expecting a cake roll that was- deeply- dyed , super sweet , and with an overbearing concentration of flavor in the first bite . Instead , we got a light green roll that was appropriately , and not overwhelmingly , sweet. - The cake itself was on the verge of being dry , but the cream was tasty- and balanced everything out . <p> On the downside , although the roll certainly smelled of pandan , it tasted like a plain cake . <p> The Verdict : Its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was really strange smelling the pandan flavor without- tasting it . On the very rare occasion we are craving cake , we 'd prefer to have a homemade slice from a local bakery or simply- stick with the Thai snack featuring pumpkin in sweetened pandan flavored coconut milk . <h> Would You Eat These Unusual Thai Snacks ? <p> These unusual Thai snacks are things- we do n't  go out of our way to- eat , but thought it would be interesting to give them a try and compare them to some of the things remember eating as kids . Two out of five- is n't too bad . Would you be willing to any of try these ? Which ones would you pass over ? <p> the long stringy ones are dried cuttle fish . some are made of cod fish . yes they do smell when eaten in aircondition room . they do n't  have the spicy coating , in fact that 's the original dried stringy cuttle fish squid / or fish in Asia . <p> Hi chris &amp; angela , Have you try jackfruit chips ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there any snack which you have been thinking to try ? i just like how you show pictures of different kind of food and snack because it gives the blog a taste of Thailand . you may want to consider writing about chiang mais festives season .

My wife and her family loves those things and will frequently all indulge while were out sightseeing in the car with all the windows up ! Yuck ! Its either burn up with no smell and the windows down or have A/C with the smell . Not sure what the best of the two evils is . <p> Good grief , we can only imagine how bad that could be !

So what did we end up putting into storage before our move- and why ? <p> Our stash , which was split up among the- attic and basement guestroom of- my- parents house , contained belongings from our previous nine-to-five life- that had n't  been sold , donated , tossed , or otherwise meticulously chosen to take with us and flown over several continents to Thailand . <p> Going through the- stuff we left behind when we moved abroad would be interesting , right ? We were- quite curious to see what we had considered important 2+ years ago- and- if it was still worthy by our- standards today . On the flip side , itd be entertaining to see if there was anything we kept that made us go , " What were we thinking ? " <p> Perhaps the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit this ) was that- we- I had big plans to go- " shopping " through our belongings and- bring back a few things on our return trip to Thailand , most notably- kitchen items. - Yes , we traveled halfway around the world to bring back with us pots and pans <p> We went up into the attic expecting to pull out two boxes of kitchen stuff . As it turned out , we left- five boxes of kitchen paraphernalia and another two boxes filled with old college engineering books , personal training guides , and- a slew of books and magazines related to cooking . We swear we got rid of- all that stuff ! <p> If you can tell from the boxes , we could basically stock an entire kitchen if we ever came back . <p> In retrospect that 's not a bad thing . Its not like crock pots and dishware go out of style in a few years . Decades , yes , - but- that a ways away . <p> At least we correctly guessed that we had left only two under-the-bed clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had saved but he knew what he had n't packed. - He proudly pointed out that there was not- a single item of office clothing . In fact , before we left he made it a point to toss his work slacks , button-up dress shirts , and ties because he vowed never again to work in a cubicle . <p> He pulled out almost exclusively T-shirts and shorts and one by one held them up to his body . <p> " Look . Can you believe this ? " <p> There he was , holding a pair of plaid shorts up to his body Weight Watchers style . The shorts were so wide , as were the shirts he was unfolding . It turns out that Chris is now nearly 30 lbs lighter than he had been when we first left America and nothing fit . <p> So much for bringing back any clothes ! They promptly went into a donation pile . <p> The one exception was a few pairs of ankle socks. - " These are fancy ! Its like I bought some- brand new socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand instead . " <p> I had a bit more variety in my box including : <p> Peacoat and ski jacket <p> Five scarves , a cold weather Russian hat , gloves <p> Two sweaters , four tops , summer dress <p> Two pairs of jeans , three pencil work skirts <p> Black dress heels , Toms shoes , waterproof galoshes , leather boots <p> Two purses <p> I may have no use for a Russian ear hat or high heels in Thailand , but I could use my Shun knives again ! <p> Most of what I- left behind was cold weather clothing . I figured I 'd rather have a heavy coat on hand if we ever visited in the winter . <p> The only thing I was a little baffled at was the number of scarves I kept . Really , I needed five ? I will admit that- I got a bit nostalgic looking at my black- heels , comfy jeans , and leather boots . And I definitely missed my fancy- wine glasses ! <p> As planned , I grabbed a few things to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some clothes , Chriss socks , my pair of Toms , and some kitchen stuff including a garlic press , a strainer , and two of my favorite knives . <p> Now its time to crack open a much needed bottle of wine and drink from those fancy goblets that have been neglected the past two years . <p> Does shipping knives in your checked in luggage cause any problems ? I see lists and lists of things you " Ca n't " take on a plane out of the USA . I like having a pretty well stocked kitchen , as I enjoy cooking , but I thought , okay , I 'll just buy all that stuff when I get to Chiang Mai . But it seems like its difficult to find quality there ? <p> Under no circumstances can you put your cutlery in your carry-on bag .

But one thing we 've completely overlooked was traveling Thailand in a campervan ! For all of those travelers who find- RVing nostalgic , you 'll be happy learn about Thailands first- campervan company , Campervan Thai . <p> It never occurred to us to travel in a campervan in Thailand . Its probably because of all the different modes of transportation we 've used , weve never seen one during our travels . And we think the local Thais can agree we- caught several of them staring at our unique ride- and pointing in awe as we drove down the highway . <p> These vehicles- are ideal for a group of friends or a family and the perfect combination of a comfortable sleeping area and transportation . Even tour groups are encouraged to use Campervan Thai to explore Thailands countryside . <h> Touring with the Small Terra Campervan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Campervan Thais smallest vehicle . Its good for two to four adults , but there are bigger vehicles available too . This includes a mid-sized that holds six to eight people and the largest size that holds eight to ten people . <h> Main Cabin Area <p> The area above the drivers cab offers ample storage for luggage . There are also several interior drawers with locking doors as well as cubbies and shelves to hold items . There is even a small wardrobe area to hang up clothes . <p> The vehicle- is- equipped with a microwave , mini fridge , flat screen TV , and radio with a speaker system . There is also a small sink attached to its own small water tank . <p> The interior lighting , air conditioning , and converter run off the campervans battery . We only used these amenities- when the vehicle was running . At night , we used the generator for power . <p> The dining table can sit four people , but its- more comfortable if two people sit at the table and the other two sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four cup holders and several small shelving areas to keep containers and other small items- from sliding around . <h> Bathroom <p> The bathroom is equipped with a shower and toilet , which are- hooked up to a water tank in the campervan or an external water source . There is a shower curtain and two small shelves for toiletries . Although the bathroom is small ( wide and tall people may find it tight ) , its completely functional and also has a sink and a small trashcan . <h> Sleeping Area <p> The camper has two sleeping areas that fit two adults comfortably each . One is above the drivers cab , which expands by 1.5ft to produce extra sleeping room . Even though Chris is 61 ? - tall ( 185cm ) with broad shoulders , we were both able to sleep next to each other comfortably with room to spare . The second sleeping area is made by converting the dining table in the main area. - There is privacy curtain that separates the two sleeping areas . <p> The windows can be opened at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice cross breeze .

Approximate gas mileage is 5- to 8- KPL and fuel tanks vary in size from 76 to 100 liters . Gas currently costs about 30 baht per liter ( $3.45 USD per gallon ) . <p> A driver is optional .

Everything from the helpfulness of the owner , the professionalism of our driver , and the amenities of the campervan were amazing . <p> The interior was in excellent condition and very clean . The smallest- model- was plenty of room for the two of us and our driver , but we agree that up to four adults and certainly a family of four can travel comfortably in the smallest vehicle . <p> The wardrobe area was a convenient spot for keeping one of our smaller luggage bags . We also liked that there were two drawers immediately upon entering the campervan that were a perfect spot to store our shoes . <p> The ambient lighting was a nice touch- ( four different settings ) , in addition to- single overhead light in- both sleeping area and the bathroom . The air conditioning was powerful and ran smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating our needs . He drove responsibly ; was always there to pull out the stairs when we stopped ; kept our doors locked when we were exploring areas away from the campervan ; tidied the vans interior every day ; turned on the AC before coming back into the vehicle ; and even turned down the bed in the evenings . <p> In short , the service was impeccable and we were really impressed ! <h> Suggestions <p> As excited as we were to hear the campervan had Wifi , it was spotty at best . However , from past experience while- traveling in Thailand , cellular service is limited in some areas. - Our lack of Wifi- may have had less to do with campervans abilities and more to do with our route and lack of good cellular service . <h> Packing- Recommendations- <p> Since you are n't  staying in a hotel room , make sure to pack the following items : <p> Toiletries , preferably in a small bag that you can clip or hang from the small rails in the bathroom <p> Trash bags <p> Towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks <p> Three prong plug adapter to charge large appliances , such as a laptop <h> Things to Know Before You Go <p> The owner will make sure you are well prepared for your trip . Allow and extra 30 to 45 minutes before your planned departure time for instructions on how to use the generator , to test drive the vehicle , how to fill up the gas , and how to hook up the water and electric sources at a campsite . <p> Vehicles are equipped with a GPS locator to be able to find you- in case of an emergency . There is a second unit that can be mounted to your windshield and gives directions in English . <p> Campervan Thai has agreements with 18 different campsites and guesthouses around Thailand where you can park overnight and use their facilities for a small fee . <p> If you are lost or need assistance , there is a 24 hour hotline to contact ; if you need help , Campervan Thai will send someone to help you . <p> Campervan Thai is located in Bangkok but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them- for their rates as prices will vary . <p> NOTE : In the event you do not make it to your- evening- destination , Campervan Thai recommends parking- overnight at a gas station and to not park on the shoulder of a main road . <p> DISCLAIMER : We received a three-day guided tour with Campervan Thai compliments of Travel Bloggers Exchange ( TBEX ) . Although we were not obliged to write a review about Campervan Thai in exchange for this expedition , we were genuinely amazed by their services and wanted to pass along the details of this unique campervan experience to our readers . <p> We need to get from Bangkok to Chiang Mai with our family . Weve flown before but wanted more adventure this time , so booked train tickets but the trains are full : ( So just saw this idea.looks awesome ! Can you drive the camper van from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and leave the camper there ? Do you know how the drive is ? I know its about 700km in distance , but what are the roads like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm actually thinking of shipping my RV from Canada to Thailand for a few months . It would actually still be cheaper than renting this RV for an extended period of time . <p> Were not sure what the fridge runs on , but you can certainly contact the company directly ( they can respond to you back in English ) with that question . We cant believe that shipping your RV all the way from Canada would be cheaper . You staying for a long time ? : ) <p> Very interesting . Weve been to Thailand a few times and certainly had n't  seen these before . A fun new option for traveling . Weve rented campervans in New Zealand and Australia and are currently getting ready to embark on a trip driving the PanAm highway to South America and LOVE having the self-driving option .. very fun ( although it is pricy for Thailand I was surprised at the cost ) <p> RVing is so popular in America and Australia its a new thing in Thailand and ( at least for now ) does n't  have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who like to travel at their own pace . We could definitely tell campervans are unusual in Thailand we got many interested looks from local Thais : ) <p> As a campervan-dweller , these vans look amazing ! I 'd never have considered it either for Thailand but this is a great idea . Quite expensive ( not that Ive ever looked at how much it costs to rent a van elsewhere ) but could be a good alternative for an interesting trip ! <p> Its not too bad if you love RVing and get a group of friends together and split the cost . Its all about what you think is worth spending money on , and for some , its totally in their budget . Were happy to see this option available though because a lot of people like traveling this way . <p> We agree its a bit of a sticker shock , particularly because were in a land of $5 per night guesthouses and $1 plates of food . But for the people who have fond memories of RVing and love traveling independently , its money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read about RV camper in Thailand let alone seeing one . It is so cute and looks pretty modern , efficient , but kind of pricy for Thailand standard , unless traveling with a few people . It is still very nice to know that there are more traveling options . I do n't  know where campsites located but it sure comes in handy when traveling beautiful countryside . Thank you for this information . <p> Were excited to share this company with our readers . Many people seemed really curious about the details when we were instagraming and tweeting about it last week . Campervan Thais site lists their campsites ( 18 of them ) with which they have agreements already . If you choose to take a route that is not near these , the owner is happy to make other suggestions . Glad you found our post useful ! <p> Yeah , we were amazed ! So spacious on the inside . We absolutely loved every second of it . Such a great way to explore Thailand , and the drivers were excellent all around ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@59574668 @8574668/ <h> Frogs in Thailand ? This is Freaky <p> Since its closing in on Halloween , we thought we would celebrate by sharing something truly freaky ( or cute ? ) with you all . Have you seen this short timelapse video we recorded at our house showing the utter craziness of the frogs in Thailand during the rainy season ? <p> By this point you may or may not be considering a life in Thailand or in another country other than your own . One thing you may have forgotten to consider are some of the pests you may encounter in you new host country . Although this surely does n't  happen everywhere , we were definitely in for a surprise when the rainy season formed a small pond next to our house that quickly became the home to what seemed to be every single one of the frogs in Thailand ! <h> How Bad Are the Frogs in Thailand ? <p> Before you get too alarmed , we should tell you that this actually only happened for about the first three weeks of the rainy season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of the pond , hop a short distance into our driveway , and then begin climbing up the walls on either side . We were a little worried because each time it would occur it was evident that the frogs were getting - bigger and bigger . We could only imagine if they had stuck around when they became full-grown ! <p> Now , we werent scared of these harmless ( non poisonous ) little frogs , but it was definitely a bit of an inconvenience . It always seemed to start raining right when we got hungry and needed to hop ( pun intended ) on the motorbike to grab a bite to eat . Not wanting to squish a hundred little frogs in the process , we would have to wait until their numbers dwindled down . They would clear out when it stopped raining and the sun started to reemerge . <p> Where were all of these frogs headed ? What was over the wall they so desperately climbed ? Nothing ! Just another driveway identical to ours . It was like they were running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the frogs would just stick ( literally ) - around and hang out for a while if it did n't  stop raining . So , how do you get rid of frogs in Thailand ? Well , occasionally we would have to turn the hose on and gently spray them out of our driveway , usually inadvertently towards our neighbors housewhoops ! <p> We can only imagine the animals in Thailand we will see next . So , during your travels have you ever experienced anything like our " Invasion of the frogs in Thailand ? " What kind of pests do you encounter where you live now ? <p> We lived in Siem Reap , Cambodia for over 2 months during the raining seasons and we had the same problem . There were plenty of little frogs , bugs and cockroaches around our house . We got used to them after 2 weeks or so : ) . <p> Yea , at first it freaked us out , but we were more amazed by it more than anything . It was so predictable after the first couple rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them do this for an hourblew our minds ! haha <p> Never saw this phenomenon on any of my trips to Thailand but I was always intrigued by the numbers and size of the geckoes . I was not familiar with them and on my first trip I awoke during the night to a strange sound , turned on the light and was staring at dozens of them some 6 or more inches long . I might add that this was not in a hotel but in a small house in a rural area . <p> Yes , the lizards are everywhere . We actually quite like having them around since they keep the mosquitoes that do get in our house under control . Only the strong survive in our house though because our cat hunts them relentlesslyhe is obsessed ! <p> I do n't  know if these guys makes noise , but they have some loud uncles in the pond next to us . They sound like mooing cows ! : ) 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 8 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574669 @8574669/ <h> We Made Some Big Changes <p> Feast your eyes on our redesigned website ! Can you believe we started this project six months ago ? We spent our free time choosing a new theme , crafting a new layout , and implementing smoother navigation . We are still doing some final touches here and there , tweaking and ironing out bugs as we come across them , but its a great feeling to make this monster go live ! <p> We 'd like to say thank you to all of our regular readers for your patience as we wrestled with this huge project . <p> And just in case you came here through a link , here 's a snapshot of our new homepage : <h> REDESIGN GOALS <p> We had several reasons for redesigning our blog . We wanted a more attractive and user-friendly site that WOWed anyone who came across it . Plus , we wanted to make it easier to browse our content all while loading in a snap . <h> 01 Sleek , Professional Look with a Responsive Theme <p> It was time our blog received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it nearly three years ago , it was time we upgraded to a premium WordPress theme . Sure , our site has tons of information but it bothered us that it did n't  have a quality look . We opted for a sleek landing page , a wider layout to showcase our pictures ( we had so much wasted space on the sides ! ) and a responsive theme that looks great whether you 're viewing our site on a PC , tablet , or a smart phone . <h> 02 Streamlined Navigation <p> While we believed that portions of our site were easy to navigate , there were other parts that were severely neglected . We wanted to make sure that our readers , whether dedicated followers or new , were able to find exactly what they were looking for intuitively . We merged some of the older categories together ( ones that had only a few articles each ) while the other overly saturated categories were expanded out . <h> 03 Speedy Load Time <p> We noticed our old blog lagged in load time . As in over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . How embarrassing ! We , too , are guilty of clicking off pages that do n't  load within a few seconds , so we knew we were losing readers . Our new theme loads in a snap , so you 'll have near immediate access to our content anytime you visit . <h> THE NEW LOOK <p> Were proud of our new look and hope you like it , too . Here is a summary of the major changes : <h> Homepage <p> Our old blog design never had a true homepage . Readers were simply plopped off at a list of our five latest posts . And though many people find us through individual posts and may visit our homepage only every once in a while , an attractive homepage or landing page can really make a lasting impression . Plus , its functional and helps guide our readers to where they need to go right from the start . <h> About <p> One of our most visited pages is the Our Story page and we decided that it was time to freshen up our pictures . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several mediums so we included links to our growing social media platforms . If you love our blog , you can also follow our live updates on Twitter , Facebook , Pinterest , Instagram , and now YouTube and Periscope ! <h> Start Here <p> A brand new section , we wanted our newest readers to instantly get highlights about Thailand and direct them to our favorite and most popular blog posts to help them during their first visit to our site . <h> Destinations <p> One of the biggest changes to the blog was overhauling the old Travel tab . On our new site , any post that is destination specific ( including transportation guides and accommodation reviews ) is included in this category . On our old site , we had all of our Thailand related travels lumped together but had separate tabs for travel around other countries . Now the destinations are split into five major regions of Thailand plus a section that is exclusively about our travels in other Southeast Asian countries . <p> Once you land on a region specific page , we further break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled to . <h> Lifestyle <p> Generally speaking , posts that are not destination specific go under Lifestyle . We reduced the categories from thirteen to nine , which include topics such as life as an expat , Thai food , teaching in Thailand , and information about visas . We also re-categorized our articles so that most of them now fit into a single category and not two ( or even three categories , yeesh ) as we had before . When we tested it out , we actually enjoyed looking through past posts . Its now an easy walk down memory lane and we no longer feel lost or turned around as we once did . <h> Resources <p> Although we share tons of tips and experiences on our blog , we understand that some people need more personalized attention to make their visit or move to Thailand as stress free as possible . Our coaching sessions are perfect for anyone who wants to pick our brains about living in Thailand , or more specifically , Chiang Mai . Our self guided tours are meant for anyone looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , and hotels to stay at during their vacation in Thailand . <p> Readers who want to know what tools we use when we travel throughout Thailand are just a click away to the same programs and websites we find helpful . And although we do n't  write posts about " how to blog , " we do get questions from time to time about what tools we use , so we included a handful of programs we used to create our site . <h> Membership Site <p> Another huge change still in the works is expanding our blog to include a paid premium membership site . We have tons of information to share about Thailand but there 's content we considered to be exclusive , too . Were excited to be able to monetize this part of the blog and give even more details to our dedicated readers . This is another huge project in the making and will launch in Spring 2016 . <h> WHAT DO YOU THINK ? <p> There you have it ! A quick look at our blog overhaul . <p> We are still ironing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks but the site should be bug free over the course of next month . Were relieved this massive project is over so that we can now focus on creating regular content again and the material for our Membership Site . <p> What do you think about our sites new look ?

@@59574670 @8574670/ <h> Veterinarian Cost in Chiang Mai <p> Some travelers or those looking to start a life abroad may be wary of the level of care available from Thai animal hospitals , or wonder if they exist at all. - We recently experienced a mini midnight emergency with our cat , MooShu , and visited two clinics that provided everything we could have hoped for . They had clean facilities , knowledgeable English-speaking veterinarians , and satisfactory medical treatments . And to top it off , the veterinarian cost in Chiang Mai was only 10% of the cost of similar services conducted in the US . <p> We noticed our cat was in severe pain during the wee hours of the morning and had no idea what veterinary services were available in Chiang Mai . Would a veterinary clinic be open ? Would the veterinarian be knowledgeable and speak English or only Thai ? Would the facility be clean and well-equipped ? Would the veterinarian cost in Chiang Mai eat us alive ? <p> A quick online search directed us to the 24 Hour Purpoon Animal Hospital located off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to our relief , confirmed that our cats condition was not life threatening and no immediate action needed to be taken . The visit took all of 15 minutes and was free of charge . Although we declined any services , we were relieved to know that this facility is open around the clock in the case an emergency arises . <p> After checking out several online reviews , we discovered that Chiang Mai actually has roughly twenty animal hospitals with English-speaking- vets . So the next day , we opted to get medical treatment for MooShugo from the Chiang Mai University Small Animal Hospital located off of Highway 121 . <h> Profession Staff and Clean Facilities <p> The CMU Small Animal Hospital accommodated us immediately and the veterinarian quickly diagnosed MooShus condition , which was the same as the Purpoon clinic . The veterinarian was professional , friendly , and thorough in explaining his diagnosis , how he would evaluate the severity of our cats condition , and what medical treatment he recommended . <p> Hours and phone number for the CMU Small Animal Hospital <p> We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animal Hospital had a large waiting room , was well-lit , and both looked and smelled clean . The animal hospital is equipped with an emergency room , an x-ray room , an operating room , and ten exam rooms . Our exam room had a stainless steel exam table topped with a fresh towel , a sink and cabinets stocked with first-aid equipment , and the walls were decorated with posters about dogs and general animal health . Later we visited the x-ray room where the equipment was in good condition . No dirty floors , rusty surgery equipment , or clogged sinks here ! <p> One major difference from our vet back home was that we assisted in holding our cat still while they conducted the tests instead of the vet technicians . We even held him still during the x-ray , radiation-reflecting jackets and all ! <p> We finished the visit by discussing what to do if our cat was feeling better or not in the next few days , as well as what the long-term expectation of his condition could be . After settling the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just under an hour . <h> Veterinarian Cost in Chiang Mai <p> Another major difference between veterinary treatment in Thailand compared to the US was how inexpensive the bill was . For nearly identical services , our veterinarian costs in Chiang Mai was 10% of the cost as our veterinary bill in Northern Virginia . That 's about a $350 price difference ! <p> Veterinarian- Cost <p> USA <p> Thailand <p> Examination <p> $65 <p> $2.62 / 80a++ <p> Two Medications <p> $148 <p> $8.70 / 270a++ <p> Two- X-Rays <p> $174 <p> $19.30 / 600a++ <p> Medical Instruments <p> N/A <p> $8.00 / 250a++ <p> TOTAL <p> - $387 <p> $38.55 /1,200a++ <p> The level of professionalism , timeliness , thoroughness , knowledge , and quality of facilities in Chiang Mai was comparable to our experience in Northern Virginia but they provided all this at a fraction of the cost . It was also refreshing that the Small Animal Hospital did n't  try to sell us expensive and " necessary " flea and tick medication , de-wormers , dietary supplements , etc , as we were trying to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our old vet . <p> The most important part is that our fur-child is on the way to a healthy recovery and is nearly back to his old self , chasing bugs and lizards and lovin life in Thailandand of course , napping in his spare time . <p> Glad to hear about this ! What a relief ! My husband and I are moving just south of Pattaya in July , and we are bringing our two cats . Hopefully we will be able to get set up with a good vet wherever we set up house . I 'm glad MooShu is all better : ) <p> Major cities ( including Pattaya ) are sure to have the vet care you need for your two cats . We have since found another highly recommended vet just down the street from where we live . MooShu is doing great , but its good knowing we have a wonder vet to take care of him if needed .

@@59574673 @8574673/ <h> Baan Suan Krua , A Homestay in Samut Songkhram <p> We love Thailands homestays for their unique character- and- personalized service . So when we were introduced to- this homestay in Samut Songkhram called Baan Suan Krua , it was love at first sight . In a town not far from the southwestern outskirts of Bangkok , its the perfect place to spend a long weekend getaway for 1500 baht ( about $45 USD ) per night . <h> Kicking Back at a Homestay in Samut Songkhram <p> This charming- homestay in Samut Songkhram is called Baan Suan Krua ( a+aa+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+ ) , which literally means House Garden Kitchen . Tucked away from the main road , we arrived there just after sunset and walked into- an- outdoor dining area surrounded by lush greenery , soft lights , and an overall wonderful ambiance . <p> The property hugs the banks of a canal- and features a privacy fence made of blossoming foliage. - There are several lounge chairs and umbrellas that overlook the canal. - That area also features an outdoor grill and prep area if you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , swings and hammocks , and even paddle boats to take a scenic trip up the canal . <p> The homestay was once a two-story traditional Thai teak home . The owners of Baan Suan Krua live on the top level of this Thai stilt house- and later converted the open-aired lower level into three separate spacious units . <h> Modern Garden- Rooms <p> A few steps past the formal outdoor dining area , we entered into what was perhaps the largest accommodation- in Thailand we 've ever been in . <p> Bright , clean , and simple . And cold AC ! - The room- even came with a second mattress- that- we used while getting our Thai massages that evening . Its not in the picture , but there 's also a huge flat screen TV mounted on the wall in front of the bed as well as a fan . <p> There 's a desk area within arms reach of a mini fridge . Its stocked with soda , beer , and water . There is also a hotpot and a selection of tea and instant coffee , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Much to our surprise , there are- several different ambient lighting options . There is also a large window that let 's in a lot of natural lighting . <h> Bathroom <p> The Western style bathroom is bright and large . It features a modern toilet and a hot water shower complete with a rain shower head and a shower curtain . Wow ! That 's something we rarely see in Thailand ! - The shower also included dispensers of shampoo and body wash- that- can double as hand soap . <h> Alms to the Monks <p> An incredibly unique feature of this homestay in Samut Songkhram is being able to give merit to the monks as a guest . Every day in the early morning between- 6:00am and- 6:15am , monks from a nearby temple silently make the journey up the canal in their long canoes and pass by Baan Suan Krua . <p> The homestay has a small set of stairs that lead down into the water . Making prior arrangements with the owners , we gave- offerings to the monks of steamed rice and a small bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchid flowers , incense , and candles . <h> Dining Options <p> Guests at- Baan Suan Krua are welcomed to shop at the local market and bring the goods back to cook dinner themselves. - As an alternative , - the owners are happy to whip up a few of their Thai favorites using whatever is in the kitchen at the time , which is open from 7:00am to 9:00pm . <p> Breakfast is included in- the price of the homestay and includes fresh local fruit , freshly baked bread ( ! ) with butter and jam spreads , and instant coffee and hot tea . The owners also offered us a hot plate of fried eggs , garlic toast , and ham and sausage- with- a small side salad . If you prefer a Thai breakfast of rice porridge ( kao dum ) , they have that , too. - They offer fresh espresso and tea drinks from their drink menu in addition to their breakfast options . <h> Service <p> The service was excellent and the grounds and room were well taken care of . We could really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take pride in their business and home and present it well to their guests . <h> Baan Suan Krua Amenities <p> Thai kitchen open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ; breakfast inclusive <p> Mini fridge with cold beverages , snacks <p> Powerful AC , fan , and flat screen TV <p> Hot water rain shower ( ! ) <p> Laundry facility onsite <p> Thai massage " two hours for 400 baht <p> Wooden boat with paddles to explore river <p> Free reliable Wifi <p> Clothes drying rack <p> Queen size bed ; an extra bed is available on request <h> Overall Stay <p> We had a wonderful experience at the Baan Suan Krua homestay in Samut- Songkhram . We enjoyed having meals outside in their beautiful garden area , the quaint- privacy of the property , and the one-of-a-kind experience of giving merit to monks along the canal . <p> We also enjoyed some of the- best Thai massages weve ever had in Thailand , which were conveniently hosted onsite . We highly recommend getting one during your stay at a going rate of 400 baht per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suan Krua is near- the city center of the Samut Songkhram province , which is about an hour and a half drive southwest from Bangkok . The best way to book this homestay is by contacting them directly through Facebook or email , as they are not listed on major hotel booking sites . <p> If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing place to spend a few days , whether you are traveling alone , with a significant other , or with family , Baan Suan Krua is- the place to go . Its places like this that- showcase the amazing- hospitality of the- people- of Thailand and were glad to have found it . <p> DISCLOSURE : We received a one-night stay compliments of TBEX ( Travel Bloggers Exchange ) - Asia 2015 . Although we were not obliged to write a review about Baan Suan Krua , we thoroughly enjoyed our time there and wanted to pass along the details of this homestay in Samut Songkhram- to our readers . <p> Hi I 'm so happy to find your site its great !

@@59574674 @8574674/ <h> Lining Your Pockets with Thailands VAT Refund ! <p> During our first two months of living in Thailand we bought a GoPro camera and an expensive new laptop , and were excited to receive our VAT refund for the additional value added tax we were charged on each item . Seeing as our first 60 day Thai tourist visas were coming to an end , we took an international flight to Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia to renew our multiple entry visas . We knew this would be the opportune time to give the VAT refund process a shot , and by taking two steps in addition to our normal routine , we were able to put some money back into our pockets . <p> For anyone visiting Thailand on a tourist visa and who has purchased an item worth 2000 baht or more that will be taken back to his/her native country , he/she may be eligible for a 7% VAT refund on the purchased item . In fact , many countries provide a VAT refund program for international tourists with varying tax refund percentages . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major steps to complete . First , a VAT refund form ( p.p.10 ) must be requested and filled out at the store of purchase and paired with the original itemized receipt . Second , seeing as VAT refunds are given only at participating international airports only after passing through immigration , it goes to say that an international departure flight is a must . Thai airports that have a VAT refund office include- Suvarnabhumi ( BKK ) , Don Mueang ( DMK ) , Chiang Mai ( CNX ) , Hat Yai ( HDY ) , Krabi ( KBV ) , MaeFa Luang-Chiang Rai ( CEI ) , Phuket ( HKT ) , Samui ( USM ) , Udon Thani ( UTH ) , Ubon Ratchathani ( UBP ) , and U-Tapao ( UTP ) International Airports . <p> An original itemized receipt and respective VAT refund form , courtesy of TriptoAsia.ru <p> We purchased a GoPro and a laptop and met all the requirements to obtain the VAT refund . Some of the major requirements included having a tourist visa at time of purchase , purchasing the items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and completing a VAT refund form that was supplied by the store of purchase . For a complete list of refund requirements for eligible purchases , check out this article , Tips for Tourists : Who Can Claim a VAT Refund ? . <h> How We Applied for the VAT Refund at Chiang Mai International Airport : <p> Arrived at airport with our itemized receipts , completed VAT tax refund forms ( p.p.10 ) , and all purchased items that were to have the VAT refunded . We made sure to have enough room in our carry-ons ! <p> The entire refund process took about five minutes once we got to the VAT refund office . The clerk handed our refund over in cash ( baht ) , although there is an option to have it refunded in US dollars . Our refund was a whopping 3807 baht ( $130 USD ) ! This was well worth the extra effort in requesting the VAT refund form while at the store and going to the VAT tax office at the airport before our flight took off . <p> We- urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase in Thailand ! <p> NOTE : At Chiang Mai International Airport , we were not able to find customs officials to inspect our goods and stamp our VAT refund form before going through immigration . In fact , several employees directed us to go through immigration and to go straight to the VAT refund office . We later read other accounts of people have similar experiences in which nothing was inspected and no forms were stamps but only at Chiang Mai International Airport ! 161248 @qwx571248

We had been on the prowl for a few days and had narrowed it down to two bikes a Honda PCX ( 150cc scooter ) and a Honda CBR ( 250cc motorcycle ) . Although we had several people recommend the PCX , we ended up surprising ourselves with the purchase of a 2013 Honda Forza ( 300cc maxi-scooter ) . We 've had it for a week and are really happy with our decision to go with it . <p> We initially overlooked the Forza because it looked like such a monster parked next to the other bikes in the show room . But after doing some research , we realized that the Forza would make us both happy because it was a combination of what we liked between the 150cc PCX and the 250cc CBR . While I had wanted something that was passenger-comfortable and had a decent amount of storage room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris wanted something that was more substantial in size and that had more get-up . <h> Forza Pros <p> Smooth Ride : Between the power , the larger wheels , and the ultra wide seat , it is comfortable enough for longer rides . <p> Extreme Storage Space : Includes enough room under the seat for two full faced helmets , has two small front compartments ( one even has a plug-in spot for a phone charger ) , and can also be equipped with an external storage rack . <h> Forza Cons <p> Big : Its heavier and significantly longer than the average scooter , making handling and parking a bit more challenging . <p> Wide Turning Radius : Similar to a motorcycles , its not possible whip around a u-turn like a smaller scooter . <p> Expensive : This bad boy cost $5800 USD , but still less than the supposed $7k price tag when released in Canada in 2014 . <p> Another shot of our 2013 Honda Forza <p> Before we purchased the bike , we had to provide a residence certificate , which we obtained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a free helmet and backpack , three year warranty , as well as personal injury insurance . We also purchased additional insurance on the bike itself , a second helmet , and a wheel lock .

I averaged about 30% less MPG than advertised , although I drove them flat out trying to keep up with traffic in the US . What fuel economy have you experienced with the Forza while in Thailand ? <p> Strange , I looked around in Phuket for a while , there is nothing below 270k , how to get it for less than 200k ?

It is a beautiful and impressive landmark that can be seen as you drive into the town of Ban Tha Dan . Many motorcyclists and cyclists make the 6km trek to the top of the Khun Dan Prakarnchon Dam for the beautiful view of both the water reservoir at the top of the dam and of the small town below . <p> Famous for being constructed out of the most compacted material in the world , the Khun Dan Prakarnchon Dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the town and nearby farms while providing a home for aquatic life .

Even if you do not golf , the rooms and golf course are beautiful , and there Is an onsite restaurant , pool , and clubhouse . <p> Well , first of all let me compliment you again on your photography . The images could have been in Conde Nast . Excellent and enticing for sure . I especially appreciate not seeing Chriss dirty socks in any bedroom photos ! : ) It would be helpful if you could share with your followers the cost of such an excursion as you have in the past . I checked their website and the rooms went from maybe $100 to several hundred per night . Was this another budget buster trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thailand that otherwise might go unexplored . <p> Another excellent post . It looks like there are some nice home accessories at Creation World Wide Wood and being sustainable is a definite plus . I sure hope that nothing ever goes wrong with the Dam . Weve seen areas near where we have lived previously that were devastated when the upstream Dam had an issue so it always makes me think when I see a town downstream from a large Dam . Thanks again . <p> The mango wood home decorations were beautiful . Unfortunately , we did n't  have an room to take anything home with us ! <p> We were thinking the same thing about the dam we hope it never fails . Controlling the water has done wonders for the town , and its also attracted tons of people who love nature activities . A win-win so far . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 9 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574679 @8574679/ <h> Hua Hin to Bangkok by Third Class Train <p> While perusing transportation options from Hua Hin to Bangkok , we stumbled across the Hua Hin Train Station . Located on the T-intersection of Hua Hin Route 76 and Poon Suk Road , this train station offers rides to many different destinations along the eastern coast between Bangkok , Thailand and Butterworth , Malaysia . <p> After discovering the railway station during our beach city exploring , we decided to forgo the popular air-conditioned bus rides from Hua Hin to Bangkok. - Given the cheap train ticket prices and that we 've never ridden on a train before , we decided to travel by rail . <p> Directly to the left of the Hua Hin Train Station is th Hua Hin Coffee Station , which is the perfect place get relief from the heat while waiting for the train to arrive . <p> The cold caffeinated drinks average 60 baht ( 2 USD ) , but you get what you pay for , including comfortable indoor seating and chilly air conditioning . The coffee shop also has a small food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other small souvenirs for sale , too . <p> Many options to choose from ! <h> Hua Hin to Bangkok by Train <p> Although there are multiple trains that run from Hua Hin to Bangkok everyday , many leave during the very early morning hours . However , there are two popular- Hua Hin to Bangkok- trains that depart from the railway station during normal daylight hours . Tickets can be purchased as early as one hour in advance and only cash is accepted . We chose to take the earlier departing third class train , which costs 44 baht a ticket ( 1.50 USD ! ) <h> Train Schedule : Hua Hin to Bangkok <p> The prices of these tickets my vary depending on the season . Prices are of July 2013 . <h> What 's a third class train in Thailand like ? <p> We did n't  know what to expect of a third class train from Hua Hin to Bangkok . The interior of the train cars reminded us of old , worn metro or subway cars . There are benches that run parallel with the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing chairs , all of which are thinly cushioned . There are floor-to-ceiling poles and handles dangling from the ceiling for standing passengers . <p> After looking at other photos of third class trains , we wondered why ours looked so much different . Those pictures show trains with benches facing the in a forward direction with an aisle running down the middle . <p> Comfortable seating was available in the beginning . As the train picked up new passengers and seats were occupied , some people had to sit on the floor . <p> The reviews online said the third class train was horrible and we thought it was tolerable . There is great scenery across Thailand that we otherwise would not have seen . Although there was n't air conditioning , there was a breeze from the ceiling fans and open windows that kept us from being too uncomfortable . <p> We were able to put our luggage in the overhead storage area . We liked that vendors came by every half an hour or so to sell snacks ( sliced fruit , fried pork rinds ) and drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - We even noticed that vendors came on board at stops to specifically sell hot food such as noodles or fried rice with egg . <p> The views during the Hua Hin to Bangkok train ride never got old . <p> Granted , if we had n't  gotten a seat for the five-hour ride and had to sit on the dirty linoleum floor , we would have been pretty miserable . That 's because its first- come , first serve . We were happy that this train originated in Hua Hin . <p> Also , even though there was a toilet on the train car , we couldnt- imagine what condition it was in and did n't  use it . Lucky for us we got a bench and there were no emergency trips to the restroom . <p> Given the few potentially negative issues that could arise , the affordable price and the beautiful open air views of rural Thailand are worth the trip and should be experienced while you are here . Third class- itineraries similar in duration to the Hua Hin to Bangkok train route are the longest trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is likely that your booty might start screaming at you . <p> More beautiful views during the late afternoon hours . <p> At the end of the journey , the sun had set and it was cooling down . - We got to Bangkok a little later than planned because the train picked us up in Hua Hin half an hour late . Luckily , we did n't  have a strict schedule to follow that night . We were covered in a thin film of dust and were ready to stretch our legs . Otherwise we had a decent trip on Thailands state railway system . <h> Would we take a third class ordinary train again ? <p> Yes , we think in the right circumstance we would , such as : <p> Being in no rush to get to our final destination <p> Being able to secure a seat <p> Having a frozen bottle of water for a cold , in-transit drink <p> Having a favorable weather forecast . During heavy rains there may be a lack of air circulation if the windows were closed <p> Bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've come across which is great for the budget traveler . <p> Have made this trip many times , its the best way to travel , people go from seat to seat selling food , kind of like a Dim Sum , lots of great scenery , windows wide open , and yes sit with your back to the engine or expect dust in eyes . On the regular train there is no seat arrangement , you take what you get , some people can end up standing , so do n't  get to fussy , grab what 's available . This is a great experience and a wonderful way to travel , I highly recommend this to all tourists . <p> Just got back from Hua Hin . Had a great time . Nice beaches and awesome seafood . I just wanted to mention that there are many Mini buses ( vans ) that make this trip from Victory Monument . Cost is 180 baht ( 5.50 usd ) . I think the mini buses are a little faster then the full size tour buses and compared to the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more convenient place for me to get to . It would cost me another 50 baht or more just to get to the train station . Just another option . If you can figure Read more + <p> Hello , I would like to know is the train ticket selling fast at the train station ? I 'm currently planning my trip from Bangkok to Hua Hin , do I need to book it online before i go or I can just buy it at the train station ? Will the tickets be sold out ? Hope you could reply me : ) <p> We bought the tickets at the train station an hour or two before it departed and had no problem with it being fully booked . However , it is possible to purchase tickets online if its more convenient for you and gives you peace of mind . Its common to pay a bit of a convenience fee or small surcharge . Have a great trip ! <p> I 've done this trip a few times . Absolutely loved the train ride to Hua Hin and would take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another class of train though as it was comfortable and no one sat in the aisles . I plan to do this trip again with my daughter once she is a little older . Loved the photos too , it brings back so many memories . <p> Some of the most beautiful places we 've seen are the stretches of farm land with mountains in the distance along the country roads and this train ride . Totally worth doing again when your daughter is older ! <p> Wow thanks for the train schedule and details ! I was planning to book a morning train at 4am from Hua Hin to Bangkok but looks like I do n't  have to now . But one question , do you know if there is any left baggage service at the station or within vicinity ? <p> There are two " windows " in the bottom of each window frame . One is glass and one is perforated metal . they sit **25;419;TOOLONG and pull up from the bottom of the frame . When it rains , the perforated metal " window " is pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air comes in . Been on this train three times now and recommend the following : Take two bottles of water .

Sit facing the front of the train to catch the breeze from Read more + <p> Fantastic list , thanks for sharing this . We never thought about sitting on a specific side , but staying out of the hot sun is a must for the longer rides . And great point about the bathroom sign .. were sure there 's a reason to it ! <p> it looks much cleaner than the train I rode from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi . I 'd still prefer riding the van going back to Bangkok , way way cheaper , plus the fact that their terminal is beside the BTS so I do n't  have to worry about taking a taxi . The travel time is more or less the same though . <p> Oh wow ! We actually heard about those train derailments because we were considering taking a sleeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot via the bus to Hua Hin at the last minute instead . Glad you guys are alright ! I cant imagine how shook up you both must have been . I think we may wait it out and see if they upgrade those tracks . Yikes ! : o <p> I can relate to your train story . I love riding the Thai trains . You were lucky it did not rain , I forgot about the closed windows . And you cant beat the price . Recently I took a train from CT to NYC , about 50 miles and it was like $40. one way and crowded . As a note Hua Hin is a place where royalty stay so that may explain why the station is so nicebut you knew that already , I suppose . Cheers . <p> Ouch , yea we can honestly say we do n't  miss those stateside prices . They seem so much more ridiculous now that we live here . You are spot on about Thai royalty residing in Hua Hin being the reason why the town and its infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons we find it so appealing . We are actually headed back in less than two weeks ! <p> Never been on a train ? Wow . Well , I guess its good you had no expectations . You make a good point about taking it during decent weather . I cant imagine being cooped up in there when its raining with no windows open . <p> Yea , we have been on countless plane , bus , and metro trips but never a real " click clack " sounding train before . We are so glad we did it and definitely look forward to a longer first of second class trip in the future . <p> If you want to go with first or second class train from/to bangkok and chiang mai , I recommend to go with Special express train 1/2 ( Nakhonphing Express ) . It have a wide bed than express train 13/14 . But you havee to reserve ticket very early because it will fully booked very fast . 161248 @qwx571248

" The fact of the matter was , we wanted to responsibly fund our overseas adventure rather than wing it and risk having money problems later . Although we were putting a portion of each paycheck towards our Thailand fund , we wanted to earn more ; our goal was to have enough money in savings to last us for one year . <h> Three Ways We Funded Our Overseas Adventure : <p> We saw it as a win-win situation . Even if we never ended up moving , it still gave us a warm , fuzzy feeling knowing we purged our apartment of things we no longer needed or wanted , saved up a ton of vacation to be used at a later date , and earned enough miles for several out-of-states trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of moving to another country came true . It took us one year to sell our belongings down to three suitcases each and a few boxes that went into storage . We earned roughly $27,500 from selling our stuff , which was more than enough money to fund a frugal , yet comfortable year living in Thailand . The vacation days earned at work were cashed out as a lump sum check after resigning , and we earned huge airline mile bonuses after signing up for some credit cards , which ultimately resulted in free airline tickets to Thailand ( $$$ ! ) See , all of our hard work paid off ! <p> Finding ways to fund our overseas adventure was incredibly rewarding and actually quite fun ! We loved seeing our savings accounts grow and grow after each thing we sold , and we happily anticipated using our two " free " airplane tickets to fly to Thailand . <p> What 's stopping you from selling some stuff for a little extra dough ? Why do n't  you start your own " Overseas Adventure " fund ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live for the long haul or is this trip only temporary ? Do you plan on coming back to the States or living and traveling frugally for quite some time ? Thank you ! Brandy <p> Our original plan was to make Chiang Mai our hub and travel to places around Thailand and Southeast Asia . So far so good ! As for moving back to the US , right now we do n't  have plans to do so as long as everything is going well with family back home and with us in Thailand . We are interested in checking out Central America , so that 's where we might move next ( in a few years ) . Right now were very happy with living lightly and traveling to new places . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 2 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574681 @8574681/ <h> Ziplining in Chiang Mai Thailand <p> Chiang Mai is surrounded by gorgeous mountains and tropical forests , which offers tons of outdoor activities to do while in town . We went on a full days excursion through a travel company called Chiang Mai Adventure. - First stop Eagle Track Zipline ! <p> Below is a video shot from our ziplining trip at Eagle Track Zipline in Mae Rim ( an hour north of the Chiang Mai city center ) yesterday using our GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition . This shows the longest stretch of the stations . Everything was safe and we had a blast with our friends visiting from the USA . <h> Ziplining in Chiang Mai <h> The Eagle Track Zipline Staff <p> Not only was ziplining exhilarating and beautiful , but the experience was made fun because of the staff . Before we began , the friendly staff collected our belongings and made sure loose-fitting shoes were tied securely to your ankles to prevent anyone from having to go barefoot for the rest of the trip . Believe us , you are so high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost or dropped . <p> A view from one of the ziplining platforms . <p> Once they assured our group that our items would be safely secured at the base camp , we were lead over to a small training area to learn the basics of ziplining . Even for those of us that had ziplining experience , we still felt like we benefited from the refresher . <p> The guides we were assigned were fun , energetic , and showed us the ropes ( pun intended ) of the lengthy course . They taught us how to go upside down and backwards and even encouraged it as often as they could ! <p> Some of the stations required you to pull yourself in if you did n't  get enough of a- running jump . <h> The Ziplining Course <p> Eagle Track Zipline offers three different ziplining courses , which range from 15 to 35 separate stations . Because ours was a packaged deal through Chiang Mai Adventure , we did about eight stations that took over an hour to complete . We were allowed to go at our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends . Water was provided about halfway through . Be prepared to walk between the stations ! <p> The last station was an awesome spiderman-like vertical descent ! When we arrived back at the base camp , we were stripped of our ziplining gear and fed a light meal of fruit , water , and coffee or tea . <p> The 400 meter platform. - It goes on forever ! <h> Ziplining Cost and Verdict <p> If you book directly with Eagle Track Zipline , the following packages are available : <p> Bronze : 1600 baht ( about $50 USD ) <p> Silver : 1900 baht ( about $60 USD ) <p> Gold : 2400 baht ( about $75 USD ) <p> Each course offers more stations and different obstacles than the last . Pick up from your hotel is available at various times throughout the day and is included in the cost of the package . <p> Overall we recommend taking a ziplining tour while in Chiang Mai . - We do not endorse any one company over an other , but can speak to the quality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that others are good as well , so whatever you do , get out of Chiang Mais Old City for a few hours and play in the beautiful treetops of the mountains surrounding Chiang Mai , Thailand . <p> Sierra , we bought a specific helmet mount that permanently sticks to our motorcycle helmet , and we also have a chest harness for the GoPro ( used during the ziplining ) . GoPro has some great accessories . Glad you find our blog useful : ) <p> Chris and Angela , First of all , I enjoy your experiences and good advice . Great blog ! My wife and I visited Chiang Mai at the New Year and had a great time with the extra street markets , sky lanterns and other entertainment ! We also booked with Eagle Track and had a great experience opting for the gold package . Our guesthouse booked for us and got a discount ( 2200 baht ) . It was almost a whole day of fun . I must say that I was impressed with the safety and professionalism of the staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more + <p> The high safety standards were one of the things that really stood out to us , and if we had to pick any activity , were glad it was during ziplining ! <p> As a matter of fact , we DO have a cooking class review in the queue .

" Can I survive on $400 USD per month ? " or " Will I be comfortable on $750 per month ? " But the most popular is , " Is $500 per month in Chiang Mai good enough ? " When we first moved here , we tried living off $500 per person per month but oh-so-quickly realized it was n't going to happen . Here are a few good reasons why we do n't  recommend anyone trying to do the same ! <h> Living Off $500 Per Month in Chiang Mai Can Be Done <p> We get it . Everyones lifestyle is different . What is modest to one person may be bare bones to another . Someones necessities may be anothers luxuries . And hypothetically speaking , it is possible to live off $500 per month in Chiang Mai if you implement a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who : <p> And let us be the first to say that 's its pretty awesome if you can manage the self-discipline and focus to do this . <h> But Its Just Not Doable For Most Future Expats <p> While it sounds reasonably manageable on paper , its hard to carry out this spartan lifestyle . Why ? Because you never know what life will throw at you . <p> Unforeseen and major " one-time " expenses will rear their ugly heads . And they can quickly add up , which will either throw your budget out the window , or worse , put you in a financial predicament where you will be forced to make some extreme sacrifices . <h> The Sacrifices You 'll Make <p> On $500 per month in Chiang Mai , most people will be able to afford fairly basic accommodation and utilities , food , clothing and toiletries , and transportation . Just not much else . <p> To put it into perspective , $500 per month is just over $16 a day . And that has to cover rent , too ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had friends and family across the globe you would like to see ? What if you had a sudden change in plans or obligations to attend to that required you to return to your home country ? <p> Round trip airfare from Thailand to the US has cost us around $1300 per person . Friends of ours have traveled to the UK and back for $1000 per person . And after spending two to three months budget on airfare alone , what money will you have left to spend during your actual visit home ? <h> No Emergency Fund <p> What if you have medical issues , an unexpected hiccup in an employment opportunity , or had troubles with the law abroad ? Can you afford to cover these expenses ? <p> What if you lost your phone or laptop charger , had your wallet stolen , or got into a fender bender and had to fix your vehicle ? Can you afford these pricey replacements or will you have to settle without them ? <p> In some cases travel and expat insurance will cover certain mishaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in insurance because you cant afford to on such a tight budget . <h> Refrain from Splurging or Treating Yourself <p> Everyone overindulges or treats themselves at various levels of frequency and intensity . How about going out for a night of entertainment ? Or taking an afternoon to shop for a few pieces of clothing to add to ( or replace ) your wardrobe ? <p> Oh wait . Youll have to settle for another evening in front of the TV or cheap cookie-cutter clothing sold at touristy Thai markets . <h> Forget Indulging in Comfort Food <p> There will come a point , even for people who love Thai food , where you cant eat another 30 baht ( $1 US ) street stall plate of chicken fried rice or red curry stir-fry . Culture shock happens and itll hit you like a ton of bricks . <p> The next thing you know , you 'll be dropping four or five times as much money on an American diner grilled cheese sandwich , or ten times as much money on an Irish pub tender roast with mounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult beverages ? Sometimes the local light beer and rough whiskey rum just does n't  cut it . Two pints of an IPA , two glasses of ( good ) wine , or two bourbons on the rocks will basically wipe out your daily budget . <h> There Wont Be Much Traveling <p> To have Southeast Asia at your fingertips but unable to explore because of your lack of finances is a sin ! <p> Sure , you might be able to afford an overnight trip to a nearby town . Chiang Mai is near to places like Chiang Rai , Chiang Dao , Payao , and Pai . But you 'll use the cheapest ( and by default , least comfortable ) form of transportation to get there and back and possibly stay in the dingiest bungalow or guesthouse . Again you 'll have to stick to the least expensive Thai food and there wont be much left for getting around town and sightseeing . <h> This Blogger Couple Ca n't Live on $500 Per Month ( Per Person ) <p> When we first moved , we tried aiming for this budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . <p> But we quickly found out that we werent happy . And especially the first month or two as we were settling in , we had a few unexpected expenses come up that definitely blew our budget out of the water . <p> For the record , our absolute cheapest month ever in Thailand was January 2014 . At 19,555 baht ( $607 ) for everyday expenses plus 15,000 baht in rent ( $466 ) , that equals out to $536.50 per month per person , and it was just too tight . <p> We realized that going out for a good burger , hanging out with friends over a few drinks , buying a new pair of running shoes or a replacement memory card for our camera made our life more livable . And that 's what life should be about , right ? So we tossed that tight budget out the window and settled for something more comfortable . <h> It 's Possible , Just Improbable <p> Can you live on $500 per month in Chiang Mai ? Yes . If you absolutely had to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could . <p> But will you be happy truly , lets-not-kid-myself happy if you did this for a long period of time ? Ehhhhprobably not . So for people who want to become long-term expats , we would n't recommend living in Chiang Mai on $500 per month and definitely not on anything less than $500 . <p> We 'd recommend increasing your monthly budget by another $100 or $200 if you can afford to , just to be more comfortable . Even that little bit goes a surprisingly long way . And make sure to have some savings in the bank , just in case ! <p> I definitely agree . Chiang Mai is inexpensive , but you have to live a very , very basic life to get down to $500 per month . The apartment we rent is about $150 per month , so that only leaves $350 per month for everything else . That about $11 per day . Three $3 meals and one good coffee and your budget is gone . I would say that $1000 per month , per person as a couple is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything at that budget . <p> Chris and Angela , We are planning to move sooner than we had originally planned . Three years is still a ways away , but its when we both reach 50yrs . Our goal is $2500 per month . Would this be adequate in your eyes . We wont be working . <p> Yes , you could be solidly comfortable in a city like Chiang Mai , Chiang Rai , Udon Thani , Hua Hin , or similar city for 2,500 USD per month . We 'd say in the more expensive areas ( Phuket , Bangkok and even Pattaya that it might be a bit tight . The cost of living is higher but there are also many expensive Western amenities at your fingertips ) . You also meet the 65,000 THB per month retirement fund quota , so that qualifies one of you for a retirement visa . Sounds like you two will do just fine : ) <p> Hi Chris and Angela , Weve been following your blog and site for months as we prepare to come to Thailand .

Keep up the great work with useful tips <p> How cool is it that you listened to us on the radio : ) The weather is the most pleasant ( coolest ) in December and January and would line up with your desire to get away from Canadian winters . We personally like the rainy season from May through October ( for most areas of the country ) . Less tourists , incredible blue skies , and you can find some dirt cheap hotel deals . Thanks for commenting ! <p> Both of you : have you try setting a budget for a week of say 1000bht for 2 person for a trial test run ? and see what you can come up with . just on daily expenses for a week . including petrol and food , simple grocery items . excluding shopping for clothes , gifts , electronics . <p> Haha , yes . Well do really well for a week or two and stick to a low budget and then BAM well just drop 3,000+ baht in one day . ( Basically , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few hours . <p> For me and mine , 60K was comfortable and allowed us the freedom to travel the entire region many times over . This was from 06 to 12 . We scored a great house with a great landlord and that made all the difference in the world . Many of my friends ( pro boxers mostly ) lived off far , far , far less , but if they 're fighting they always have a meal at the camp to rely on . <p> Had to laugh at the food comment . I have just been through that . I am based in Chiang Mai . After the last month of eating Thai food I had an incredible urge for a burger which is rare for me even in the Western countries . I found a place . As I bit into it the grease run down my chin and it was heaven , a burger never tasted so good . <p> 53 looking at retiring in 2 years with my thai wife ( married 5 years ) . Wondering about jobs . I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy and was wondering about teaching IT or working in the IT field . Should have about 2k dollars per month for wife and me she will work and I 'll work PT giving us about 90k baht for the month . Thanks for any reply <p> Teaching is not the only route but it is by far the most commonly offered to foreigners . Unless you have IT skills that no other Thai has and can apply to a Thai company ( which is why English speaking foreigners can teach English in Thailand ; they are seen as better qualified at doing so than a native Thai ) , your best bet is to apply for work online . However , big IT companies may hire a foreigner if the company is catering to foreign clients . Good luck ! <p> Keep in mind that you 're living in a developing , 3rd world country with an infrastructure barely capable of supporting its own citizens , let alone long term visitors/residents seeking western lifestyle at 1/2 the cost . Consider the following : There is little if no recycling in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra income scavenging for recyclables .

The forums are awash with keyboard warriors who only see ( or want to see ) the better side of Thailand . There are few blogs that paint an even-sided picture . most are riddled with what I have to take as deliberate misinformation .

We could probably do $500 each if we turned off our AC and skipped all western meals ( either out or at home ) but then what 's Read more + <p> Yes it is very hard to live on $500 a month and I do n't  live in a tourist area like Chang Mai , Bangkok or the likes .

I will most certainly take advantage of your coaching sessions a little later in the year if I may . In the meantime I will continue to follow these pages . many thanks again . <p> Its really nice to see such transparency about costs in travel writing ! I realize that many times , people are not comfy sharing this info but sharing it really helps others see what it possible ( and comfortable ! ) . <p> Were glad you liked this post and found it helpful . Putting a dollar amount into perspective , in this case that infamous $500 per month , will hopefully help redirect a few souls who thought they could live it large on such a tiny amount . Thanks for commenting ! <p> That 's right Tony . An ordinary police officer would earn 8000 baht per month ( though of course there are " perks " ) . A university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank up to 35000 , a teacher maybe up to 30000 , Salaries can depend on who you know of course but the minimum wage ( which many actually do n't  get particularly if non-Thai ) is 300 baht a day . So 40000 baht should be enough even allowing for prices for farangs being higher . <p> Hey guys ! I love this post . Too often people scrimp by when travelling and when living somewhereand while on one hand , I see the desire to stay on the road for as long as possible ( and therefore stretching every dollar ) , I also think that people can , and do , miss out on a lot by not upping the budget . We are around $1,500 Canadian total when living in Mexico and Guatemala but we drink a lot of wine , we travel around , we eat lots of western ( and local ) food and we are comfortable . <p> Its sounds awesome that you , too , are living it up for $1,500 . That 's our kind of number ! Glad to know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched your video on your house in Guatemala , and its really nice . ) While we understand the draw to stretch a dollar and see as much as possible , but we just happen to lean towards spending money on our creature comforts ( and yes , wine and Western food ) . Have a great one ! <p> Maybe you should reflect the costs in Thai Baht ( it is Thailand after all ) , most Thai families live off 10,000 to 20,000 baht per month . As a foreigner if you double that 40,000 baht should be more than enough . I guess this is around $1200USD <p> The current exchange rate is 32.9 THB per 1 USD ; $500 is 16,450 baht . Yes , many Thai families live on the equivalent of $500 USD per month or less , but the average Thai family also does n't  have ( many ) Western comforts and amenities , which are what quickly drive the price up . $1200 USD will be generally comfortable for many Westerners who do n't  overindulge . <p> HAHA , I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a few WT# thoughts as I had to go back and reread the whole article a few times , as you had in just one fowl swoop , shattered all of my dreams in my little glass box with a very big and obnoxious hammer . Then I realised you 're talking about $500 per MONTH , not $500 per WEEK . My dreams of living like a king in Thailand for $500PW were shattered for just a brief moment ( TRY LIKE 20 MINUTES OF PAIN ) HAHAHA So its safe to Read more + <p> On $2000 per month , you 'll do great ! That amount of money opens up a lot of doors and you 'll certainly be able to live a Western lifestyle like back home . It still amazes us just how an extra $500 or $1000 per month can change your quality of life in Thailand ! <p> $500 per month for only one person is not much . In my case , for example , I think that I need to pay more than $1,000/family to live there because besides me and my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the expenses can skyrocket . The place looks interesting , but I think you can live there only if you have a pretty big income every month . For me is not the case . <p> We had hopes of spending $1,000 a month for the two of us , but we find ourselves in the $1100-1200 range without ever saying NO to ourselves . We eat &amp; cook western foods , love our new modern condo with washer in Nimman area , go to Camp or other cafes daily , and of course a few beers during the week . I would never suggest someone aiming for $500 as a single person , agree with you 100% but being a couple it would be easier but again not ideal . Great summary ! Still cant believe we have n't bumped into you yet ! <p> Haha , $1000 seems to be the golden number for couples . We 've creeped up to $1400 to $1500 a month but like you said , its without saying no ( at least , not too much ) and living quite comfortably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome back to Chiang Mai ! <p> Those sites can have good information , but you have to struggle through all the fact-less opinions and bad comments ! We hope this post puts living on a low income into better perspective for those who are planning to live in Chiang Mai , and yes , hopefully many people stumble across it on their quest for information about living in Thailand . <p> I agree there are some good posters out there . I had some excellent advice on a holiday in Singapore from a guy on Teakdoor but , as you say , look at the majority of posts . New Mandalas owners sabotaged a well-written article by one of their own university colleagues . Whether you agree or not there is no need for flaming and certainly not to an academic colleague . It does n't  happen on my site or yours . <p> How about $3000 a month for a couple . I like to spend $500600 for a rent , newly built town-house . Rest is for utility , food , and entertainments . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it makes me happy . How are old folks there ? Retirees in Chiang Mai appear to be happy to you in general ? Thanks in advance for your answer . <p> $3000 for a couple sounds very comfortable ! You will certainly be able to live a very Western lifestyle with amenities and entertainment ( nothing outrageous ) but itll make you happy . We think there are varying levels of happiness among retirees , which of course depends on income , health , and family life , but we known several retired couples who are very happy living here . <p> Hi I am thinking of coming to attempt to live in Thailand this year , it will be me a female and my little dog . I am a therapist ie massage , injuries which I have lectured in . I have been to Thailand once and fell in love with it . I will prob need to work just part time . Any help and advice is most appreciated . I understand the visa situation and prob look at living in Chang Mai due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws regarding foreigners working here are quite strict and jobs are limited ( teaching English is by far the most available option ) . Even if its just part time , please be careful ( and do n't  get frustrated with the lack of opportunity ) with finding a job in your area of expertise . Of course we highly recommend working online if possible . Chiang Mai is an excellent start-up city and will be welcoming to you and your pet dog : ) <p> I recently found your site and have lost countless hours here . Thanks for that ! Were imminently retiring early and going travelling with our kids for the first few ( I hope several ) years . I 've put Chiang Mai on my short list for Thailand because of you guys ( no pressure , honest ) . Our plan/desire is to travel slowly through a bucket list of places that have increased exponentially from the input of the kids . There is no time limit for this but I am conscious that my kids may not want to hang out with me forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its nice to hear that you got lost on our site . No harm in that ! Slow travel is awesome . On $56,000 a year for a family of five , that 's about $930 per person per month . Youll be living quite comfortably in Chiang Mai for sure . And as a family , you 'd be sharing a house , vehicle , and those mundane but necessary expenses ( cleaning supplies , utilities , etc ) , so you can stretch you dollars farther . Keep in mind that vehicles are fairly expensive over here ( about the same price as America/Canada ) and that if you choose to enroll your children in international school , Read more + <p> For the most part I agree with you . I could quite easily live in Chiang Mai on $500 a month . However , please note that I said " easily " , not comfortably . At least not to my standards of comfort .

There is n't much temptation due to the lack of Western brands , imported foods , or entertainment if everyone closes up shop when the sun goes down . But Chiang Mai is a different beast there are so many things to do and restaurants and businesses catered to Westerners that your budget could go right out the window if you do n't  exercise proper restraint . However , there are plenty opportunities in Chiang Mai to live inexpensively if you choose wisely , and yes , it can be easily done if you choose to . But we agree that Read more + <p> It all comes down to setting expectations . Moving to a developing 3rd world country requires an adjustment to lifestyle and foregoing conveniences taken for granted in wealthier , developed countries . <p> Seasoned travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their comfort zone for the first time will need to set a realistic budget to accommodate western standards of living . <p> Many Thais do just fine with $500 month , so if one is inclined to lower their expectations and live like the locals , the expat experience can be richer and more authentic . <p> It all comes down to comfort levels . To each his/her own . Weve attempted both $500 and $750 per month each , and opting to increase our budget by a few hundred USD really allowed us to enjoy our lives here without sacrificing our comfort , safety , or emergency/periodic travel requirements . One thing Thais do n't  typically require is expensive plane tickets to their another country or staying current with the associated costs and requirements of maintaining a visa . We are n't  saying it is n't possible to live on $500 per month , but we could n't do it longterm . Thanks for commenting , Nemrut , and have a Read more + <p> Your post is spot on ! There is a youtuber who lives in Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 per month comfortably . It is completely unconscionable how he can sleep at night . My comfort zone would be around $2000 per month plus substantial savings and medical insurance . <p> Thanks , Robert ! What 's comfortable in Western standards is not the same as Thai standards , and that 's an important distinction to make . Neither our grandparents nor our parents could retire here on $500 per month per person theyd be " roughing " it way more than theyd like . $2000 per month sounds quite comfortable ! <p> Its much easier for couples or those with roommates to live on less since they share a certain amount of bills , but you 're right . If you ca n't treat yourself or travel from time to time , you 'll end up bitter with your choice to live in Thailand . With so much to see and do , its just not worth it to stay home all the time sweating the day because you have no A/C .

Too many people cant see past the dreams and forget reality ( and its unpredictability ) . And as you said what 's the point of leaving your old life behind only to settle in a rough new one . And remember that at least back home you have all your family and friends to cheer you up when you need it . Long term expat life is great and indeed a viable choice of life but life is still life no matter the country you live in . <p> Weve seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . For instance , its hard to put a price on a properly sealed bathroom with a nice Western toilet , hot water shower , and a shower curtain when you are standing over a squat toilet , having to set your toilet paper on a high shelf so it does n't  get sprayed from the showerhead , while watching mosquitoes fly in and out of your all-purpose floor drain !

@@59574684 @8574684/ <h> Five Dollar FootMassage ? <p> After walking for hours we stepped into this place eager for a massage . Everything down to the footwear was too small for Chris , but the service was excellent nonetheless . <p> Thai massage parlors can be found on every street corner in Thailand , as can coffee shops and 7-Elevens . There are literally hundreds of these places in the larger cities throughout the country , and most are clearly marked and have their prices visibly listed on the outside of their windows . These parlors are often mom and pop owned operations that have two to three large rooms . Most massage parlors reserve the front room for guests receiving foot massages . In that case , guests sit side by side in comfortable reclining lounge chairs with foot rests . For those who are receiving a full body oil massage or a Thai massage , the back room or upstairs room is reserved with beds or mats that are separated with curtains on all four sides . You undress in the privacy of your curtained area ( keep those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that enclosed area until you are ready . Rooms often have low lighting and soft music playing or a water fountain for ambiance . The masseuses are soft-spoken and most guests are respectful of each other and do not talk or laugh during massages . It is hard not to relax once you shut your eyes . After the hour spa service is complete most places will offer water , hot tea , and on occasion , fresh fruit as an added touch . <p> The $5 massages are amazing , but correct spelling is n't guaranteed <p> The most affordable- massage is the foot massage ( comparable to a Reflexology Massage ) and costs between 150 baht and 250 baht . This roughly translates to $5 to $8.50 USD for one hour of ache melting bliss . The massage begins with a foot scrub and then focuses on the feet and calves . The last 15 minutes are typically dedicated to the hands and arms , as well as back , shoulders , and neck . This massage is highly recommended after spending all day walking in Thailand ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup throughout the popular walking street markets . These places offer shortened half hour foot massages catering to those who need a break from the seemingly endless vendors lining the narrow and crowded side streets . These can often be as cheap as 80 baht ( or $2.50 USD ) ! <p> Most places offer several other kinds of spa treatments in addition to the Thai and foot massages <p> One of the greatest price differences for a service that is offered both in Western countries and in Thailand is a full body massage . In the US , a typical one-hour massage ( Swedish , Deep Tissue ) ranges from $60 to $100 USD . In Thailand , an equivalent massage ( Oil ) runs between 180 and 400 baht , which is roughly $6 and $13.50 USD , respectively . In other words , you can have almost ten full body massages in Thailand for the cost of one massage in the US ! Talk about- budget- friendly ! - With that said most hotels offer on-site spa services priced lower than those back in most Western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable if you want to save some cash. - Plus , it gets you out and about , and with so much to see and do it would be a waste to restrict yourself to hotel living . <p> We found this parlor with a fish pond and stepping-stones leading to the front door while on our honeymoon <p> It should be a crime to leave Thailand without having experienced the centuries old traditional Thai massage , a practice that some say was first performed by the Buddhas personal physician . This treatment involves stretching and applying extremely deep pressure to the muscles . It is usually done while the client is fully clothed , and can involve the masseuse/masseur walking or standing on the clients body during portions of the treatment . We have had this done several times , and it definitely makes you feel like you had a tough workout the following day . <h> With Massages there is Always the Exception to the Rule <p> Chris did have one negative experience in which half way through an oil massage in Krabi the quiet massage area was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He nearly got up and started tossing them out of the room before quickly remembering that he was half-naked and covered in baby oil . The staff did nothing to correct the situation , so we declined to leave our usual tip . It definitely sucks to leave one of these places more stressed out then when you first arrived . <p> We definitely recommend parlors away from the busier intersections of the more touristy parts of whatever town you may find yourself in . The places down quiet side streets that do n't  deal strictly with tourists will probably take your business a bit more seriously . In general they try harder to ensure that you have a quality- massage experience as their businesses are built around their reputations rather than having a convenient location for tourists . <p> I 've had a Thai massage in Chiang mai which left me in agony for 3 days so this post is very reassuring ! Your foot massage sounds great , I 've been looking for somewhere to have one done for a while as itll be my first one . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage as described ?

@@59574686 @8574686/ <h> Saving a Woman From Being Run Over By a Minivan <p> We are still pretty shaken up and in disbelief from the position that we were thrown into this afternoon . A typical ride home after picking up Angela from school turned into an ordeal that we wo n't soon be able to forget . It has been less than five hours since the incident happened , so we think writing about it might help us deal with it better . <p> At about 4:00pm while we were on our way to our usual afternoon coffee stand , we were stopped at the very busy Pantip Plaza intersection at Chang Klan Rd and Sridonchai Rd heading west . We did what we usually do and slowly crept up towards the front of the pack of cars , which is the standard practice in Thailand . The line of traffic was long , and when we reached the front we took notice that we were the only motorbike there . <p> By now I am well aware of the traffic light pattern , and I was patiently waiting for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash sound coming from my right side . Angela and I quickly snapped our heads to the right and witnessed a big silver minivan rear ending a Thai woman on a small motorbike . My first thought was that the minivan was going to stop because the collision took place on the front driver side quarter panel . There was no way the minivan driver couldnt have realized what he just didbut he did n't  stop . <p> Shockingly , the driver continued to push the bike off to the side of the vehicle , but not before the woman on the motorbike was forcefully knocked down- to the pavement , directly into the path of the minivan . That is when Angela and I started to yell as loud as we could while simultaneously jumping off of our motorbike toward the unfolding accident . Our shouts did nothing . The driver continued to push forward , lodging the small petrified woman under his front bumper . <p> We could not believe what we were witnessing as we saw the helpless woman rolling under the front of the minivan like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vehicle and throw our hands up frantically . The driver and the passenger in the front seat had very confused looks on their faces . It was clear that they knew they hit a motorbike , but it was obvious that they had no idea that there was a poor woman trapped underneath the front of their minivan . Wide eyed and not able to fluently speak Thai , Angela and I motioned with our hands that there was something under their vehicle . <p> Going back and forth from the eyes of the screaming woman to the dumbfounded faces of the minivan drivers , I made the quick decision to instruct them to back up . Luckily the woman was flat on her back and in no- position to be pulled backwards . - As the van gave way she let out a loud sigh of relief . Angela and I signaled to the woman to stay on her back while the driver of the minivan guiltily began to look her over for visible injuries . It was at this point that we saw a policeman running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Quickly glancing around , I was taken aback by the amount of people simply looking on from the safety of their cars. - Not a single person had gotten out of their vehicle to help . I could even see the driver of the car behind my abandoned motorbike start to become frustrated by the obstacle I left in front of him . Maybe he did n't  see what happened , and maybe all the onlookers were proof of the harsh reality of the bystander effect . <p> With shaky hands I ran back across the double line in the road and pushed my motorbike onto the bordering sidewalk while Angela stayed with the woman . By this time , there were two policemen marking the accident scene by spray painting white lines around the minivans tires and blue lines around the womans banged up motorbike . <p> Being rush hour , there were countless cars and motorbikes zipping around the scene , so one of the policemen had the driver of the minivan pull his vehicle to the side of the road while the other picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim was the exception to the rule and was smartly wearing a helmet , long pants , a jacket , and shoes . We watched as she lifted up her ripped pant legs and sleeves to reveal- that she was not bleeding . Crying and angry we could hear her disdain for the minivan driver in the sharp tone of her voice . We also heard her mention the word farang ( foreigner ) once or twice . We did n't  know if she knew that we had saved her from being crushed or if she thought we were complicit , but we were just glad that she was ok . <p> Next , one of the policemen quickly walked towards me . I was pretty nervous that we might be placed with some of the blame because I 've read in many online forums that if you are a foreigner and see an accident in Thailand , you should n't involve yourself . To my relief , the policeman smiled , patted me on the back , and said in English , " Thank you . " - Feeling relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " That was scary . " Briefly forgetting what country I was in , I could see that he did n't  understand a word I just said . He repeated his thank you and I replied with a- " Khap khun khrup " ( Thank you in Thai ) . <p> Angela and I sympathetically made eye contact with the woman one last time and stared with disapproval at the driver of the minivan before walking back to our motorbike. - As we drove home , all I could do was shake my head back and forth and be thankful that we were able to get off our motorbike in time to jump in front of the van before the driver had a chance to crush the woman with the full weight of his vehicle . <p> Today is a day that we wo n't soon forget , and it is going to be even harder for us to see- adults and unsuspecting small children on motorbikes without helmets riding fearlessly through the busy streets of Chiang Mai . <p> Have you ever been involved in a life-or-death situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deal with it ? <p> Scary story to read and witness . It is a relief to hear that the woman was okay in the end but what on earth was that driver doing ? Whilst I 've seen very few traffic accidents happen I 've seen the immediate aftermath . A big crowd of people looking on in China as a dead body lay in the road ( a cyclist whod been hit by a truck ) . A dead driver sprawled over his steering wheel after what looked like a high speed crash in Riyadh .

Even seeing the aftermath can be devastating , especially if its particularly gruesome . Were thankful that the lady was safe and we did n't  have the images ( and sounds ) of her dying in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for getting involved in that one . It is absolutely crazy that nobody really seems to care about stuff like that in Chiang Mai . I have seen people drive right on by the scene of a motorbike crash before as well and it blows my mind how someone could see it and not try to help . Good work on your part ! <p> Thanks Guys .

That lady is very lucky that you were there , especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys , x <p> It really takes a lot to step into a situation and try and help and thankfully I 've never been involved in anything too serious or where someones life was at risk , but I 've been that samaritan on occasion . <p> I commend you both for trying to do something and the fact that your instinct just came into effect without any thought just goes to show how great the both of you are . <p> We were just talking about the " instinct " affect over lunch today . We ran over and frantically tried to get the driver to stop without giving it a second though ! Thank you for also being a Good Samaritan ! <p> Nina and Ron , say ; Sorry you had to witness this but thank god you were there and thank you for being good Samaritans .

Everyone else just drove past , and some people actually pointed and laughed : -/ <p> Tell us about it ! Sorry about your bus breaking down . We feel that road behavior here is very strange . Most people seem to be courteous of other motorists and have no problem yielding or letting others pass , but as soon as trouble presents itself people tend to mind their own business and go on their way . We could be wrong though . We know there are good people out there . <p> When I was living in Chennai , India I was waiting at the corner of an intersection to walk across the street .

Your are right about riding bicycles on the busy city streets . I see a lot of foreigners around here that ride their bikes in the middle of the road .

We will try not to dwell on it too much and just be thankful for the way things turned out . Take care ! <p> Good on you for ignoring those forums ! Honestly that sounds so frightening . Nothing ( touch wood ) has happened to me , but my bestie saw an old man hit and killed by a semi trailer . It took some months for the memories to fade for her , so have comfort that they will fade for you also over time . <p> Ill stick to listening to my gut before I will ever listen to some strangers on a forum .

I 'm sure both you and the woman involved will never forget what happened . I hope the driver of the minivan was charged for his actions . <p> I am sure you are right about not being able to forget . We did n't  want to stick around in the road for any longer than necessary , but I am sure the driver will see some sort of punishment . Things like that here are usually dealt with the at fault individual and the victim coming to a monetary settlement on their own .

Do n't  leave home without your helmet ! It boggles my mind when I see tourists and backpackers cruising around without helmets . What really gets us is when we see someone riding around with their helmet in their lap or on their handle bars so they can quickly put it on if the police are around . Seems silly and like even more of a hazard ! <p> Whoah. what an ordeal ! ! ! ! Good on you for jumping in and preventing it from being a fatal accident .

It has simultaneously passed by slowly and quickly , but the novelty of waking up in a different country with no real obligations and only time on our side has not yet worn off . It has n't  hit us yet that this is our new home . In fact , it simply feels like we 've been enjoying a long ( er , very long ) weekend . Most days we find ourselves taking it easy , doing a bit of exploring around the city , grabbing a bite to eat from one of the many street vendors , or going to the store to supplement our vagabond belongings . And no , it does not feel like how a vacation would feel , but everything is still low key , slow , and stress free . We are adjusting well and are happy to have settled into a townhouse and to have established a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished townhouse into more of a home . I ( Angela ) spend several days a week in a class to earn my TEFL ( Teaching English as a Foreign Language ) so that I may be better qualified and prepared at finding a job when school starts up near the end of May . The cost of living is dramatically less here in Chiang Mai than it is the States , and we are happy knowing that we are spending so much less just to live , while simultaneously enjoying our lives away from a computer desk . We are gradually getting better and better at budgeting , but we still need to find that happy balance of when we should and should not spend money . We are learning not to get sucked into shopping Big C and Tesco ( Super Walmart equivalents in almost every sense minus the people of Walmart ! - From what we hear , typically after one month in Chiang Mai things start to level out a bit . We have n't met as many expats as we had thought we would have by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was wonderful to have new company , but we have yet to find our own niche in the expat community .

Some for fun , others to become a better person , and the rest to develop this blog into a tool of inspiration for others while opening up doors to greater opportunities for me and Angela . I hope my list wakes you up a little and motivates you to take a couple of steps forward in your life . We sometimes forget how complacent we can often become when we fall into lifes little mundane routines . Even changes that seem insignificant or simple can have a profound impact on the course we take in our lives . Here is to changing things up a bit . <p> I love these goals both personally and professionally . Paying it forward is a great way to make a difference . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make a world of difference for them . I have heard a saying that I love .. I give to others not because I have so much but because I know what it feels like to have so little . <p> What a nice list of goals to achieve this year . #5 is nice . Is it some sort of a pay-it-forward thing ? Regarding blog goals , reaching 1,000 likes on FB is very doable , especially since we have groups like GBN . : ) <p> I appreciate the kind words . Yea , since we departed on our adventure I have felt the the strong urge to want to make those around us happier if I can . Maybe the super friendly Thai people have rubbed off on me , or maybe I am finally loosening up after exiting the corporate rat race .

Maybe you can give me a target number to shoot for : ) <p> I just did this workout where you use a deck of cards and for each suit you do : split squats , burpees , push ups and sit ups . Whatever number comes up ( Jack , Queen and King are each 10 ; Ace is 11 ) , you do that many reps . Jokers are 25 squats . By the end of the workout you do a total of 95 of each of the exercises . That 's why I was curious . I am SO out of shape right now . Mostly just been walking and doing yoga ( mostly to keep my stress level under control ! ) . <p> That sounds like what we did when I was in the Army .

@@59574691 @8574691/ <h> Cashing in with Craigslist " Sell It ! <p> This post will layout in detail how to make Craigslist your cash cow during the time leading up to your big trip or move , but it is also definitely relevant if you are just on a serious decluttering mission . <p> Breakdown of our sales <p> Hands down , when it came to getting rid of our stuff , our biggest , most successful moneymaker was Craigslist . With 127 individual sales- through the online classifieds monster , we were able to pull in $7,642 of the $15,000 we earned through selling our household items on Craigslist alone . - That is just more than half of our total sales ! <h> Craigslist Overview <p> Craigslist is user friendly and very popular , and there are tens of thousands of listings posted every day to prove it . Most anything can be sold on Craigslist through the " For Sale " section . To give you an idea , here is a list of things we sold : <p> Furniture , anywhere from excellent to poor condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap and get it off your hands <p> A list of our top Craigslist sales showing our estimated value and the actual selling price . <p> Particularly large items ( both physically large and somewhat expensive ) are great to sell on Craigslist or similar online cash-and-carry sites . However , what things can make your listing stand out against others and attract potential buyers ? - Here are some tips - to help you compete against other Craigslist sellers for better results ! <h> Pictures , pictures , pictures ! <p> The right picture will sell your item . Post several pictures that are well lit and with clutter-free backgrounds . In fact , we recommend staging an area that has a light and neutral background that is free of other objects . This helps focus the potential buyers attention on your to-be-sold object and not that distracting mess of tangled wires , audio equipment , and that Thai language book collecting dust . <p> Before : <p> Poorly lit , distracting , with a cluttered background . - This table will sit in Craigslist purgatory ! <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clutter free background . This table will sell fast ! <p> A simple dusting or wipe down of your item with a damp cloth goes a long way . Not only will your item have a nice gleam to it , but any dark colors will seem much richer . Dirt and dust have a way of easily showing up in pictures . Also , a clean item sells faster and for more cash than a dirty or dusty one ! <p> Before : <p> My first bike ad on Craigslist has a major problem . - The background in the photo makes it hard to see the bike in a thumbnail view , so it never really had a shot of being clicked on at all . <p> After : <p> By simply taking a more thought out photo , I quickly had the attention of 3 buyers right away . <h> Description <p> Write a concise but accurate description of your item . Include details such as how old the item is , what condition it is in ( i.e , brand new , like new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included the original purchase price and why we were selling it . Include a link to an online version when possible so that potential buyers can read up on specs . A list is good ; there is no need for a long winded paragraph , but with that said do n't  be vague either . <p> Before : <p> Big couch for sale $650 . Awesome for cuddling with super cute dogs . <p> After : <p> Selling my very well taken care of brown microfiber sectional sofa with ottoman / chaise lounge . - Smoke free home . - The couch is five separate pieces , so it can be easily customized and easy to transport . Two of the pieces have minor scratches on the leather , but can not be seen unless you kneel down and look at them closely . It is free of tears , holes , and stains . It has just been cleaned and treated this week and must go as soon as possible . Includes four bottles of fabric/leather cleaner and protection solution . Originally bought for $1,100 , selling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cash and carry only ! Measurement are as follows : Side One ( Corner piece to corner piece ) 115 ? LongSide Two ( Ottoman to corner piece ) 118 ? Long , 29 ? Tall x 38 ? Deep <p> It is courteous , as the seller , to mention upfront anything that may be wrong about an item so that potential buyers know exactly what they are getting . Dresser in great condition but has a nick or a dent on a drawer ? Mention it in the description and take a close-up picture . Buyers are usually thankful that you 've included this information instead of being sneaky about it . Also , advertise any perks about the item . Include key words like " from pet-free , smoke-free home , like-new condition , never worn , " etc . This can help close the deal with someone that may otherwise be on the fence . <p> Description Tips : <p> Always say that you are moving and need to sell the item by a specific date . Every time we posted an item we said we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we werent moving for another six months . This is something you can fib about . It will push people that are serious about the item to act fast , and deter those that are just casually browsing from wasting your time ! <p> Another thing that worked for us toward the end of our selling spree was listing items under a title like " Moving Sale " and then listing everything we had left with individual prices within the ad . This drove in many buyers , and it was so successful that we decided to set our spare bedroom up as an indoor yard sale complete with price stickers and all . <p> Let people responding to your separate single item Craigslist ads know that you have other items for sale upon their arrival . If you live with a friend or partner and are comfortable with having people in you home we highly recommend going this route as we were able to sell a ton of additional items this way . Here is a panoramic picture of our very simple but effective indoor setup . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price <p> Research what the going price is of a similar item on Craiglist , since those will be your direct competitors . Second , research what the same or similar item is going for on Amazon . If someone can buy it new , online , with free shipping , at a lesser price than for your used item that they have to drive 20 miles to pick up you see where were am going with this ? <p> Post a price ( some people forget ! ) and make it clear that the buyer must pay cash only . The seller should never accept checks , money orders , or electronic funds transfers because of the risk of fraud . If the you are willing to negotiate a price , post OBO ( aka " or best offer " ) ; if you are not willing to negotiate price , make that clear , write " Price firm . " <p> Additionally , the buyer should bring the exact amount in cash originally agreed upon , but just in case , the seller should have some change on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last second . <p> Price Tips : <p> Sign up for a free Square account or similar credit card accepting account. - Most will include a free credit card reader upon setup ! The reader plugs into the headphone jack of most smartphones and tablets and the money will be electronically deposited into a checking account of your choosing- the following business day. - These will work as long as you have a WiFi or cellular connection and even gives you the option to send your buyer a receipt . <p> List in your Craigslist ads that you can accept credit and debit cards , and be sure to explain how you are able to do this . <p> If a buyer shows up with the incorrect amount of money or is interested in another item and does n't  have enough cash , having a credit card reader can save the day . - There is typically a 1.7% charge associated with this type of transaction , but it is often worth it ( you can always adjust your price to compensate for that charge ) . <h> Communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email , make sure you respond to your potential buyers- voice mail- or message at regular intervals . In other words , check your phone and email often . A potential buyer can be permanently lost if it takes the seller a day or two to respond back to the request . <p> Better yet , post the same listings approximately 12 hours apart through several different email accounts ( Keep from being flagged by making each post unique ) . This is because Craigslist posts your listing at the top of its feed , but it quickly moves down in ranks as more people post items to sell . Your posting can only be renewed every three days , so having multiple accounts can give you an edge . <p> Beware of scams . If you receive a email with any of the following , please ignore : <p> If the email has one line " Is this item still available ? " without specifying what the item is , ( just " this item " or " it " ) . <p> If you receive a reply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a question mark ( ? ) , with no other writing in the email <p> If you email back a potential buyer and almost immediately receive respond back with a story of how said-buyer is out of the country and they will send you a certified check paid for more that what your item is worth and will have a friend there to make the transaction , etc , etc , etc . <h> Scheduling <p> Be prepared to forfeit most evenings to Craigslist sales . If you are on a tight schedule , make it clear in your post from the beginning ; " Available for pickup on weekends only . " We noticed that most people browse Craigslist and make offers during the weekdays . However , the best time to expect to sell an item are Friday evenings and the weekends . <p> There is also the unspoken etiquette that the buyer is responsible for transportation unless there is mutual agreement to meet at a halfway point . Also , buyer has first dibs on time and day . <h> You Ca n't Argue with Results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash in a safe at home . - That is what we did , and of course it was amazing to shuffle over $14,500 in cash , but it is not worth the risk in the end. - It was kind of a celebratory thing , but it was pretty scary feeling having that much cash on me in my car as I made my way to the bank . The look on the bank tellers face was utterly priceless. - We were both obviously nervous to the point of it being comedic . <p> It was n't like I had all one- hundred- dollar bills . I had plenty of fives , tens , twenties , fifties , and even a handful of two dollar bills . I have to say I have never felt like more of a suspect for doing something completely innocent . Looking back on it maybe we should n't have separated the cash into rolls of $1000 with small purple rubber bands . <p> All in all we are very proud of our success , and we look forward to hearing about your experience with Craigslist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move within the next six months , and if you 're not it does n't  hurt to get the ball rolling early ! We will also address the ins and outs of selling stuff through- yard sales , consignment shops , and eBay . <p> Thanks for posting this ! Ive been thinking of using either Craigslist or Gumtree to sell lots of my old stuff before travelling . I had my doubts however , who would go on there to buy my old stuff ? But after reading this you 've given me some inspiration . Its on the to-do list for tomorrow ! : ) <p> Awesome , Stacey . Anothers mans trash is another mans treasure , right ? There are actually some great finds on second hand places like Craigslist simply because people do n't  think their old stuff is worth much Its very rewarding selling your stuff and putting your earning towards your travels .

I 'm in the process of selling most of my furniture and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server , buffet ) and bedroom set . I posted both sets all together as the set but wonder if I should n't try to sell each piece individually now . Thanks ! <p> We recommend posting sets together and wait and see if you have any willing buyers . If no one responds , lower the price a bit to see if there are any biters , but not below the price point at which you are no longer willing to sell . Its more rewarding ( both emotionally and monetarily ) to get rid of things in sets than one by one . If you still do n't  have any buyers , then advertise the pieces separately . Depending on how much time you have , wait it out for buyers who will buy the set and then only sell it individually when Read more + <p> We just started selling our belongings on Craigslist last week and so far , so good .

( Northern Virginia ) . Our names will remain private and unmentioned in this blog until we have given notice to our employers about our impending plans to travel abroad . <p> We have been tossing around the idea of escaping the hustle and bustle for a little over a year now . Sitting in my office one day I found myself in a conversation with my friend , officemate , and retired US Army First Sergeant when he began spouting off about ditching everything and moving to Belize . Of course he was n't serious , rather just making a few weightless threats in a moment of anger and frustration stemming from his new found civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me .

I could n't go a day at work without distracting myself with thoughts of living on an island in the Caribbean or a lying on a beach on the coast of South America somewhere .

" This- question lands in our inbox quite often but its one that we have a hard time providing a concise but thoughtful answer to . Unfortunately , without knowing a persons travel goals , priorities , and budget , its nearly impossible for us to give a worthwhile suggestion regarding where to travel in Thailand . <p> The thing is , travel requires a lot of personal decisions and everyones ideal vacation or trip is different . Rock climbing in Chiang Mai may be an adventure to some and a nightmare to others . Sunbathing on a beach in Krabi and sipping cocktails for days on end may be relaxing for people who just want to unwind but downright mind-numbing for people who want to get out and explore . <p> Lesson learned : - there is no one-size-fits-all answer . <p> Never fear ! Weve put together a few questions you can ask yourself to help you decided where to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you choose Thailand ? <p> Was it a display of Thai art you saw on Pinterest ? A beautiful scene in a movie ? An out-of-town-trip that randomly landed you at a Thai restaurant and your first experience eating its exotic cuisine ? <p> Ask yourself , " What was it that first put Thailand on my radar ? " <p> We first became interested in Thailand after- dining at an incredible Thai restaurant where we lived just outside of Washington , DC . We subsequently binge watched- Anthony Bourdains No Reservations episodes about- Thailand and were pretty much hooked after that . <p> Nowadays- when we travel in Thailand , we put a lot of focus on the local cuisine . We enjoy cooking classes , food tours in local markets , and snacking from food stalls . We like to know what the local specialty is or our hotel receptionists favorite restaurant . <h> What is your number one priority while traveling ? <p> Think about what you want to accomplish during your travels . What are the ultimate- goals you want to achieve before you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most important to you makes it a lot easier to decide where to go and what places to- dismiss . <h> Are you here to decompress and disconnect or to explore ? <p> So maybe you 're the type that likes to take it easy and opts for leisurely activities such as spa treatments or reading a book in a bungalow on one of Thailands quieter- islands . <p> Or maybe you 're they type to take a guided tour through Bangkok , go cycling or trekking through forests in Chiang Rai , or go swimming and snorkeling in the crystal clear waters of Southern Thailand . Less physically demanding yet equally entertaining activities may be more to your liking- such as- Thai food cooking courses or local art classes about- creating paper umbrellas or clay pottery . <h> Is depth or breadth more important ? <p> As you plan for your trip to Thailand , are you choosing places based on how many items you can cross off your bucket list ? Is it important that you get those once-in-a-lifetime selfies- with iconic- landmarks before heading to the next city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and get to know one town really well . It takes some of the stress out of traveling when you are familiar with a place and its people . Plus , its pretty cool to hang out in the lesser known restaurants and attractions that are n't  frequented by tourists . <h> Do you consider logistics part of your traveling experience or do you prefer to be hands free ? <p> Some people find it tiresome to handle the domestic chores of booking flights , finding places to eat in an unfamiliar town , and figuring out the logistics for getting- from point A to B. They prefer that these details are taken care of by someone who is more familiar with the area so they can focus their full attention on the experiences of the trip . If this sounds like you , we 've got you covered . <p> Others love to fly by the seat of their pants and figure things out along the way . Who knows the amazing people you 'll meet in the process or the extraordinary restaurants you 'll stumble upon that are never- mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your style ? <p> Some people dive head first into the culture and genuinely enjoy eating the local cuisine in hole-in-the-wall restaurants or sleeping in a Thai-style villa with a unique open-aired bathroom . Others- rather dabble in a foreign experience during the day but retreat to the plush comforts of Western restaurants and hotels during their down time . <h> What are your limitations when you travel ? <p> Conversely , knowing what limits your travel will help you make important decisions that would otherwise cost you time , money , or convenience . <h> What 's your budget ? <p> We have to disagree with- Pinterest memes such as , " Do n't  worry about money , just travel ! " splashed across a picturesque sunset photo . <p> Let 's be realistic ! - Money plays a huge part in travel . <p> Sure , there are beautiful places such as temples and national parks that are free or nearly free to visit , but there are also countless luxurious or entertaining things to do if you 're willing to spend the money . - Luckily , Thailand is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . You can do a lot on a small budget or have your mind blown if you spend big- in Thailand . <h> Do you have the time ? <p> For people who have a small window of time to travel and want to make every minute of their trip count , choosing how to travel and the length of your individual activities is critical . <p> If you only have a few days to spend in Thailand , flying- to your next destination and taking a 15 minute cab ride to your hotel sure beats taking an overnight bus , then a 30 minute cab drive to the pier , then an hour-long ferry ride , and then another 30 minute drive to your final- destination . <p> And if youre- planning to take a scheduled tour , which ranges from half and full days to multiple days , you 'll have to decide if this fits in with the rest of your itinerary or not . <h> What are you physically capable of ? <p> Thailands- tropical climate , your physical- ability , and any medical conditions you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you travel . <p> Thailands hot , humid weather can suck the energy out of even the most active people .

But we understand that its not the case for everyone . <p> If you find yourself in need of medication or medical treatment while in Thailand , you can find western standard hospitals with English-speaking staff in major towns .

So when we 've needed a sand and sun fix , we 've gone to Koh Chang . If anyone else finds themselves in need of beach time , - heres- a comprehensive guide on how to get from Chiang Mai to Koh Chang on a variety of budgets . <p> Koh Chang ( pronounced Gaw Chahng ) does n't  seem to pop up on travel itineraries nearly as much as islands like Koh Samui or Koh Phi Phi ( Gaw Pee Pee ) . Its one of Thailands larger- islands on the eastern banks of the Gulf of Thailand . It happens to also be one of the closest islands to Chiang Mai . We think its an amazing place to visit- even though it does n't  get as much attention as the islands further south do . <p> There are several ways to get from- Chiang Mai to Koh Chang . Weve broken it down into three tiers based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its possible to make the trip in as little as seven hours or nearly- twenty . Up to you ! <p> Since all three transit methods pass directly through Bangkok , you can consider this a guide to traveling from Bangkok to Koh Chang , too . <p> TIP : - Trat is- the town on the mainland that has the ferry- access point to Koh Chang . Some routes do n't  advertise going to Koh Chang but rather " Trat " or " Trad . " - That 's the correct bus to take and you will be dropped off at the Trat Bus Station . <p> This trip is hard on your tailbone and butt cheeks . However , its the cheapest option from Chiang Mai to Koh Chang . It begins with a bus from Chiang Mai to Bangkok , then another from Bangkok to Trat , and then a ferry ride to the island . <p> Bus tickets from Chiang Mai to Bangkok can be purchased- at the Chiang Mai Arcade Bus Station ( Terminal 2 ) . This is on Kaeo Narawat Road on the northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus with- Sombat Tours . They offer both VIP air-condition bus ( 1,005 baht ) and simple AC bus ( 754 baht ) - from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. - Tickets can be purchased the same day of travel but its best to buy them at least a day in advance , particularly if its during a weekend or Thai holiday . <p> Their VIP bus is incredibly comfortable ( only 24 passengers ) with wide seats , blankets , and individual TVs . The extra money is well worth it ! It also stops at a clean rest stop that serves hot food and snacks about halfway through the trip . Take the overnight VIP bus because you can squeeze in a little sleep and not- lose a whole day to travel . However , there are- daytime buses , too . The ride is about 10 hours . <p> Once you make it into- Thailands capital , you 'll arrive- at the Ekamai Bus Terminal . This is also known as the Bangkok Bus Terminal ( Eastern ) . It is conveniently located on- Sukhumvit Soi 42 just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bus tickets from Bangkok to Koh Chang can be purchased at the- Cherdchai Tour counter . It sells one-way first class air-conditioned bus tickets for 265 baht ( 9 USD ) cash . Round trip tickets are available , too . <p> There are several departing times of Cherdchai Tour Bus from Bangkok to Trat . The ride- takes roughly six and half hours . This bus has a tiny toilet , makes one quick bathroom , and does not provide snacks or blankets . Its a downgrade from the VIP Sombat Tours bus but it gets you to Trat . <p> The bus ride ends at the Trat Bus Station located off the main highway ( Route 4 ) . Its a big building in good condition and has an open aired waiting area , clean bathrooms , and a food court . Once you 're at the Trat Bus Station , there will be songthaews ( truck taxis ) waiting at the bus station that can take you to the Centre Point Laem Ngab Pier to catch the- ferry . A 45-minute- drive cost us 50 baht per person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip ) . <p> Another bus company that departs Bangkok is 99 Tour . It actually bypasses the Trat Bus Station and goes directly to the ferry . Tickets for this bus company can be also purchased at the Bangkok Bus Terminal- ( Eastern ) for two departure times of 7:45am and 9:45 am . <p> Once you 're at the Centre Point Pier , the ferry departs roughly every hour from 6:00am to 6:00pm . Its possible to hop on it just moments before it departs. - The last ferry from Trat to Koh Chang departs at 7:30pm . Make sure you have a place to stay in Trat . If you arrive at the bus station past 6:30pm , - you might not have enough time to make it to the pier . <p> Vehicles can also cross on this ferry , so you 'll see a big line of cars and trucks waiting to board along the pier . While you wait , there is a small snack shop with cold refreshments and snacks and decent bathrooms . <p> The ferry takes just shy of an hour to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of day , songthaews will be waiting at the Koh Chang Pier to offer a ride . It is- possible to rent a motorbike right off the pier . However , it may not be a good idea if you have a lot of luggage or are a beginner driver . <h> Tier 2 : Flight to Bangkok and VIP- Van <p> Travel <p> Place <p> Time <p> Cost <p> Bangkok Airways <p> Chiang Mai ( CNX ) to Bangkok ( BKK ) <p> 1.5 hours <p> 1,350 baht <p> Wait time <p> Suvarnabhumi Airport <p> 1 hour <p> N/A <p> VIP van <p> Bangkok ( BKK ) to Koh Chang hotel <p> 7.5 hours <p> 600 baht <p> TOTAL <p> 10 hours <p> 1,950 baht <p> A good middle-ground alternative to get from Chiang Mai to Koh Chang is to combine a flight and a van or bus ride .

It was a 7.5-hour drive . Alternatively , we could have taken the 40-seat air-conditioned bus , but it would have dropped us off at the Centre Point Pier after a 5.5-hour drive .

On our latest trip ( April 2017 ) , we flew into the Utapao Airport just outside of Pattaya and then rented a car for about 1,200 THB per day . It was sooooo easy . It gave us the freedom to explore the island on our own . Plus , the roads are too dangerous for motorbikes and taxis are few and far between late at night . <p> You can also check out what 's available on through 12go.asia , our go-to platform whenever we need a bus ticket . Whatever you choose , we hope you have a wonderful trip . <p> Hi , Thanks to your advice , I 'm using your 2nd option to get to Koh Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made it in time for the 9:30 VIP bus , but that has been removed from their schedule , the next bus is at 11AM with a scheduled arrival at 5pm .

Around 750 Baht depending on which ticket agency you buy from on the island . Plan on not getting to the airport before 17:00 . ( It would be quicker to take the early morning minibus to Suvarnabhumi and then take the free shuttle to Don Meuang . Then you 'd be there around 14:00 . ) Do n't  fly into Utapao its a hassle getting to Koh Chang from there unless you wan tto pay for a Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting post ! I was wondering if there is a direct bus from Chiang Mai to Trat ? I guess every bus would pass through Bangkok . However a direct overnight bus would definitely save us some hours <p> Our guess is yes , seeing as though all the airport we 've been to are pretty good about providing van or bus services to nearby towns . We do n't  know how much but vans from BKK to Koh Chang run 600 baht per person , so we 'd estimate around that price . Sorry we could n't give an exact answer because we have n't gone that route yet . <p> Hi Guys , There is another option soon as Kan Air will or maybe do already fly to Utapao airport near Sattahip from Chiang Mai . That will help the buttock pain a lot ! From there to Koh Chang will be painless lol <p> Chris , I 'm still a elderly parent with dementia away from making my trip , however I read each and every article you write . I find both you and Angela so grounded in your approach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can have a request , would love to see you write more on undiscovered beach areas with full time ex pat populations . My goal is to spend time , and possibly re locate to a beach area that is not commercialized like the well known resort areas . <p> Bill , thank you so much for writing this . It put smiles on our faces . And to honor your request , yes , we will be sure to write about less commercialized beaches whenever the next time we travel there .

@@59574698 @8574698/ <h> Choosing the Best Hiring Agencies in Thailand <p> When trying to find a job teaching English in Thailand , especially if its your first time , some prospective teachers turn to a hiring agency for help . Before settling for the first hiring agency you stumble upon , consider what they offer- beyond the salary . Here are a few things to keep in mind while looking for the best hiring agencies in Thailand . <p> A hiring agency often bridges the language gap and professional responsibilities between a Thai school and an English teacher . More importantly , they take care of job placement , legal paperwork , paychecks , schedules and time off , and providing substitutes . So what do the best hiring agencies in Thailand have to offer ? <h> Finds You a Job <p> First and foremost , a hiring agency finds you a teaching position at a good school . This is assuming the office has agreed to do so , you meet their minimum hiring requirements , and they have a position available at one of their contracted schools . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job support . Will they help you find another job if your current position is not working out ? Are they flexible in the positions to which they hire out , such as summer , part-time , or substitute work ? These are all good questions to ask . <p> Although each school is different , our experience has been that its the schools responsibility to pay the hiring agency , not you . Wed be wary about paying a hiring agency for finding you a job , whether a one-time fee or a monthly deduction from your salary . Once you 've agreed to a salary from the hiring agency , you should get that full salary without any surprise deductions when payday comes around . <h> Provides the Correct Paperwork to Obtain Legal Documents <p> At the very least , a hiring agency provides a teacher with all supporting paperwork- to first apply for a single-entry Non Immigrant Business Visa and then later apply for a Work Permit . These are what you need to- legally work in Thailand . Before the 90 day expiration date , a Non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The hiring company must provide the supporting paperwork for that extension ( applied for at your nearest immigration office ) and you must have been already approved for and received a Work Permit . <p> Thailands hiring agencies who are on top of their game will provide the paperwork in a timely manner . An acceptable time frame is within two to four weeks. - If a hiring agency can not or will not give you the paperwork to get a Non Immigrant Business Visa or a Work Permit , then its best to find yourself another hiring agency . <p> TIP : It is ultimately your responsibility to have the correct paperwork when applying for a Non Immigrant B Visa . Double check the documents given to you ( counting them is the easiest ) against the online list of the Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate to which you are applying . <h> Your Paycheck is Paid in Full , On Time , Every Time <p> Whether you are paid weekly , bi-weekly , or monthly , you should know exactly when and how much you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it be cash , direct deposit , or check up front before you sign a contract . <p> The better hiring agencies will provide you with a paycheck that is always on time and paid in full . If any pay is docked , it should be accounted for , such as Thai taxes and time off . If you 've signed a contract for a given salary and find yourself getting cut short for obscure reasons , you need to question your agency . <h> Provides a Clear Work Policy <p> Ask about the work policies of both the hiring agency and the school . This includes the hours you work , applying for time off , breaks and lunch hours , handling sick days , the grading system and submitting grades , completing and submitting lesson plans , and handling problematic students . You should be notified ahead of time and compensated for any time spent teaching on weekends , holidays , or after school . The best hiring companies make it clear upfront to prevent any misunderstandings later . <h> Schedules Substitute Teachers <p> If you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be responsible for scheduling a substitute teacher . In the case that the hiring agency does not provide substitute teachers and requires you to find your own replacement , you should be made aware of that up front . <p> Also consider asking what you are required to give the substitute teacher . This may include detailed lesson plans , worksheets , or other materials . Or , the hiring agency may supply a general lesson plan on your behalf . <h> Pays for Legal Documents <p> Hiring agencies are obligated to- provide the paperwork for the proper work documentation , but the best ones will actually pay for the legal documents , too , including : <p> Single-entry Non Immigrant Business Visa ( 2,000 baht ) <p> Work Permit ( 3,000 baht ) <p> One year visa extension ( 1,900 baht ) <p> These expenses add up quickly for a new teacher and can be as much as a quarter of your first months salary ! On top of finding a place to live , buying work clothes , and generally adjusting to a new life in Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hiring agency pays for these legal expenses . <h> Grants Paid Sick or Vacation Days <p> A typical semester runs around 18 weeks and full-time salaried teachers should receive paid sick or personal leave days. - The typical- amount is five days paid leave . If not , ask what the hiring agencys policy is if you want or need to take a day off ( docked pay , counseling , loss of job , etc ) . - You will also get time off during Thai government holidays , which is roughly four days per semester . <p> The agency should give you a work schedule that lists work days , holidays , and semester breaks . You should be able to know exactly what your schedule is upfront if you want or need to take time off . <h> Offers Insurance <p> Some hiring agencies offer their employees health insurance . Although healthcare is relatively affordable out-of-pocket and there are many insurance companies to choose from , its convenient to have coverage right at your fingertips . <h> Pays for Traveling Expenses <p> Its great to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visa run . Some pay for- the transportation , accommodations , and the neighboring countrys visa fees accrued while leaving Thailand to apply for a Non Immigrant B Visa . Others say they- pay for the one way ticket to Thailand ! The best hiring agencies in Thailand will offer a helping hand to cover these major expenses . <h> Who are the best hiring agencies in Thailand ? <p> While we are n't  aware of the perfect hiring agency that covers everything we 've mentioned above , here are some that come close . <p> Keep in mind , a hiring agency should meet the minimum requirements of finding you a job ; providing the correct paperwork for your Non Immigrant Business Visa , Work Permit , and extension ; and always paying you in full . <p> Hi Chris and Angela ! I was just given a conditional offer from Media Kids Academy to start in May . Do you know anything about this agency ? There is n't a lot of information about them online that I could find . I have been given the choice between three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Muang , Prachin Buri , an elementary school in Watthana Nakhon , Sa Kaeo , and another in Namphong , Khonkaen .

I like Read more + <p> We have not heard of the Media Kids Academy and would have to dig around for reviews . As far as different locations , Prachin Buri is closest to Bangkok , which is great for socializing and having a weekend vacation in the city if you 'd like , but the country is right there if you 'd prefer that , too . We 'd probably choose that one for the variety . Khon Khen has a small expat community but is far away from any major city with English speakers and weve only been to a market in Sa Kaeo . Its a tough decision ! <p> Is it possible to find a hiring agency that does not require you to go through their own TEFL/TESOL program ? I will already have the TEFL certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency can provide . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , What a helpful post . I 'd strongly recommend anybody who wants to teach in Thailand to use an agency . Why ? Its Thailand . My fave country in the world , and the country where I feel happiest and yep , its where I feel most at home but , its Thailand .

I 'm super interested to apply in Thailand for English Teacher , but I can not make it for the month of May . Can I apply in Thailand this coming October ? . Hope I can receive reply .

When you 're already trying to adjust to life in a new country and then hang-ups happen over miscommunication , it can be a relief to have the middle man there to take care of everything . And thanks for the comments . <p> You two are the best ! Appreciate the practical relevance of this information . As a former ESL teacher through the Dept. of Defense Dependents Schools ( with 27 years total teaching experience in 3rd-12th grades , much of this in Japan ) this info may come in very handy to me should I miss teaching and want to return at some point . Thanks so much for taking time to post this . <p> What about non-teaching jobs ? Teaching jobs , at least in my opinion , tend to pay low , besides my own lack of enthusiasm for the teaching profession . I 'd love to know about non-teaching jobs which require , say , my level of English language proficiency I 'm sure in Bangkok there would be such jobs ! Do you think hiring agencies could assist in identifying such jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand 10 times at last count , I 'd LOVE to live there long term , but there is no point if you are financially struggling in a fun destination ; the Read more + <p> We are not familiar with any hiring agencies for non-teaching professions , but that does n't  mean there are n't  any out there . Generally speaking , if a Thai person can do a job ( mechanic , doctor , florist , etc ) then a foreigner can not . But speaking native English and teaching it is something that a foreigner has a one-up on many Thais . This helps explain why the majority of job opportunities in Thailand are English teaching positions . If a hiring agency has connections with companies other than schools , then there might be a chance to land a job other than teaching . This will require a little Read more + <p> There is some great info here but many of these " offers " are legal requirements . According to the Labor Protection Act ( LPA ) of 2008 , employers must provide sick days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctual payment of salary . The English-version PDF of this document is readily available on line . One critical bit that was left out is that a good placement agency will pay on a 12-month contract rather than the 11-month contract that many agencies are moving to now . Its a ploy and we can safely assume the agency is getting paid by the school for Read more + <p> Excellent advice ! Knowing what is a legal requirement is a good way to weed out the bad hiring agencies . Unfortunately , there are agencies who count on newbie teachers not knowing any better . Well update the post accordingly with a link to the LPA . <p> Hey Guys I have n't commented on here in a long time , been really busy . Just a random question , do you guys or your friends know of any good local clothes makers / tailors ? ? ? Reason being I have favourite shorts and I do n't  like wearing anything else , so I was thinking of getting a fair few pairs made up of different sorts and colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them made over there and shipped vs a price from a clothes maker here in Aus . Cheers guys Mark . <p> There are tons of tailor shops in Chiang Mai , but weve never used their services . Unfortunately , we 've heard that they can be both inexpensive and expensive , you just have to find the right one that gives good quality and does n't  over charge you . Wish we had a recommendation ! <p> Hi Chris &amp; Angela , I would like to ask a question about health insurance you mentioned in the blog . If coming from Australia ( as we are ) or the US like you guys , can you buy health insurance from within Thailand while you are there or is it best to purchase it from the origin country ? Just wondering if you have come across more of that info ? Love your blogs by the way , very helpful.keep em coming ! <p> We have n't done enough research on international health insurance to give you a recommendation , but there are definitely affordable international health insurance and travelers insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company outside of Australia , your premiums will be a lot lower <p> Thanks ! I wish I had known a few of these before I started teaching ! Glad to help the next person out . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 10 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574699 @8574699/ <h> Ao Manao Beach Trip <p> During our short vacation to Hua Hin , we took a road trip to Ao Manao. - One of Thailands nicest beaches along the inner coast , Ao Manao is roughly 90 km ( 55 miles ) south of Hua Hin in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan , and is not often visited by foreign tourists . It was our second road trip since coming to Thailand , but this time it was n't on our comfortable , road cruisin 300cc- Honda Forza. - Instead , it was on a 115cc- Yamaha Mio Fino rental scooter , which made the questionable roads and weather a bit of a battle . - It is not something well want to go through again , but it makes for a good story . <p> First of all , riding 90 km on a small rental- motorbike with dinky helmets is nothing like riding 90 km on our own larger motorbike with full faced helmets . We realized how much we took it all for granted ! Our rental helmets offered no protection against the elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and there was a thin film of dirt on our faces by the time we reached Ao Manao . We also sorely missed the storage area for the camera bag we brought along , which we reluctantly took turns wearing on our backs . - As for traveling , we were stuck putt-putting on the shoulder of the main road as big tanker trucks and cars flew by . - It took us a little over two hours on the motorbike to finally make it safely to Ao Manao . <h> First Impressions of Ao Manao <p> Ao Manao was not as expansive or as commercialized as we thought it would be , even though the beach is quite famous for its unique crescent shape . The narrow strip of beach slightly curves around the clear , dark blue-green water of the cove , and there are islands off the coast that make for a gorgeous and unique backdrop . <p> Snapped this awesome picture nearly by accident as we were setting up our camera <p> Even though we visited on a holiday weekend , there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other foreigners- but us. - The beach itself was impeccably clean and free from typical tourist trash ( even driftwood and seaweed ) , and had unique light pink patches along the sand . Closer inspection revealed deposits of millions of small white and pink swirled shells . <p> An example of the colorful shells that decorate Ao Manao beach <p> To our surprise , Ao Manao is lined with evergreen trees rather than palm trees , which offer plenty of shade for those looking for relief from the sun. - On the south end of the crescent , there were even fewer visitors and several deserted boats anchored in the shallow waters . <p> Pine trees reflecting off of the water of Ao Manao bay <p> The beach has ample parking , stands from which to rent beach chairs for a few baht , and bathrooms. - The bathrooms are n't  in great condition , but it is a place to go if you really need to . Showers are also provided to rinse away the beach sand . There are several permanent outdoor food courts in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . We enjoyed some of the best seafood we have eaten in Thailand here ! <p> Saying goodbye way too early <p> Unfortunately , we got to Ao Manao in the late afternoon and were only able to enjoy about two and a half hours of the beach before it got dark . - On a future visit , we would like to walk along the entire length of the beach and even jump at the opportunity to go up the mountains to capture a picturesque shot of the famous crescent beach . <h> The Ride Home from Ao Manao <p> We left Ao Manao shortly after sunset , but our nice trip ended ten minutes into our drive home when it started to rain. - With no visors on our helmets , no rain jackets , and a dim headlight on our motorbike , we had a long journey ahead of us. - We ended up buying ponchos ( the best $4 spent on our trip ) that saved us from a miserably wet and cold ride home , and our camera from water damage . We both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we do n't  plan on doing something like that again if at all avoidable. - Although we enjoyed our day trip to a quiet , beautiful beach , and ate some amazing seafood , we wont be visiting by way of under powered motorbike again. - We will definitely look for alternative transportation , likely by train or car , the next time we want to visit Ao Manao . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , First of all , I got to say that you two are brave to quit your job , leave the comfort zone at home and go for your dream . Congratulations ! Nice to hear that you visited Ao Manao . Its only 4 km from where I live in Klongwahn and its also my favorite beach , especially on the weekdays . The tiny swirled shells you saw are called " hoy tubtim " in Thai , which literally means ruby shells . Ao Manao will hold Weerakham Fair on 7-15 Dec with lots of activities . You can learn more about Ao Manao here . Hope you Read more + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be honest we were a bit surprised with how non-touristy it was given that we were there on a holiday weekend . We wonder how different the beach is during the hotter months ?

I love doing some scooting around a city , but I understand as you say how things can be a bit dangerous at times . Then again , if we always sought out the safe , wed be at home : ) <p> Scooting around the city is no problem at all , but the highway down to Ao Manao is a bit rough ( surprising potholes , rocks , and cars trying to get somewhere in a hurry ) . We just got done with a 3 hours ride through the twisty , wet mountains of northern Thailand on our Honda Forza and we felt much more comfortable on a bigger bike . Our butts are definitely sore at the moment though ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinky bikes just make us feel way too vulnerable to the things around us .

@@59574700 @8574700/ <h> Reader Stories : Amy Clover Visits Chiang Mai <p> Let 's start this post off with a little bit of honesty : I had n't  even heard of Chiang Mai 6 months before my trip there . I know , I know , but I 'd always focused my attention on the beach cities in Thailand when I drooled over travel blogs and Pinterest pins . <p> The reason we decided to venture north instead of south to the beaches was for the Loy Krathong/Yi Peng festival , one of my " life list " items ( a positive take on the " bucket list " ) . Youve seen those Pinterest images with thousands of lanterns floating up into the night sky ? Those were likely taken at the lantern release at Mae Jo University just north of Chiang Mais old city . <p> We landed in Chiang Mai as part of our honeymoon , after a slightly disappointing experience on the Western shores of Bali ( too party-hardy for us ) , and feeling a bit untrusting from a bad experience in our 24-hour stopover in Bangkok ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We did n't  know what to expect , but we hoped it would be a more pleasant , quiet experience than the ones we had on the former part of our Southeast Asia trip . <p> Thankfully , our hopes were fulfilled and then some . We arrived in a serene villa that welcomed us into their warm , family-like atmosphere like a bear hug from Grandpa . I highly suggest The Secret Garden just outside of Chiang Mai city ; the service is above and beyond anything we 've experienced anywhere else , and its surprisingly affordable . Book well beforehand , though , as they fill up quickly ; we could n't stay for our entire stay in Chiang Mai due to full occupancy . <p> Walking around Chiang Mai instilled in us a sense of peace , oneness and harmony . People will look to help you if they can , and if they cant , theyll ask someone else if they might be able to . We felt more than welcome in this new city ; we felt taken in by the community . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Sunday Night Walking Street Market . We left our guesthouse with the equivalent of $40 USD to get us through the day . We started off at a restaurant for breakfast , then went to take in a few temples , donating to each one we visited , before going to a massage appointment . <p> When we emerged from our appointment , the streets were lined with vendors . Food , crafts , clothes and musicians packed the sidewalks as a few tourists roamed slowly amongst them as they set up . Renewed from our massage and considerably hungry , we joined the trickle of tourists , slowly taking in each stand as we walked . It was a wonderful way to take in the culture of the city while taking part in the collective wide-eyed delight that embodied every tourists face , as we slowly moved as one down the street . <p> We 'd stop periodically to try foods we 'd never seen before . Most of them were delicious . Some were an experience . <p> Within 30 minutes , we were shoulder to shoulder with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed ! We had to take little breathers , not because the crowd was pushy , but because we were becoming so full on all the street food that the body heat created by the crowd was a little nauseating . <p> When we finally made it back to our guesthouse at around 10 PM , we still had money left over ! It was a fantastic experience , but my favorite part of our entire trip was attending the event that brought us to Chiang Mai in the first place : the Yi Peng lantern release at Mae Jo University . <p> The celebration can only be described as magical . The guesthouse we were staying in pulled together all its travelers to form a group that would attend the festivities together . We scheduled a taxi to take us there , wait for us in the same place wed park , and drive us home . This is essential when you 're planning on attending this festival ; getting in and out can be super tricky . Do n't  plan on finding a way home from Mae Jo without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Though we had read " warning " blog posts from foreigners who had- bad experiences at the festival ( some people thought it was too crowded and feared that it would become riotous to which I would reply , " Its a BUDDHIST ceremony ! " ) , the people facilitating the event couldnt have been more helpful ! <p> Volunteers from the university stood at each turn to direct us toward the arena , some even chanting welcome greetings in English , Thai and Chinese . Our group arrived only half an hour before the event was due to start , so the arena was pretty packed . We made our way in and scattered a bit to find seats , setting a meeting place before we did . The arena was full , which was amazing to reflect on ; an entire arena full of people who attended to release wishes and good fortune into the universe ? As a new-age hippie , I was all in . <p> The event was narrated in English , Thai and Chinese . Many of the visitors refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice on the loudspeakers instructed us all to , but in the end it did n't  really matter . The actual release was beyond astounding ; it was life-changing . <p> Staring up into the wishes of thousands of people burning bright and rising into the clear , star-studded sky was moving beyond compare . The emotional power behind the rising solar system-like spectacle brought strangers together in embraces , regardless of the partys language . I could n't help but laugh through my tears of joy as I silently took in the climbing lanterns , lighting up the darkness with the strength of our collective good intentions . Like I said , magical . <p> We came for lights , but left with an even brighter one inside us . A part of us will always shine from within thanks to our experience in Chiang Mai .

@@59574701 @8574701/ <h> Chiang Mai Monthly Expenses <p> So what 's our spending like in Chiang Mai now that we 've lived here for a year and a half ? It 's been twelve months since our last full budget report , so here 's the latest in what we spend living a good life in Thailand . Onward to our Chiang Mai monthly expense report , round two ! <h> Chiang Mai Monthly Expenses , Round Two ! <p> The two of us spent just shy of $1500 last month : <p> Rent &amp; Internet : We left our townhouse and moved into a two bedroom house just outside the Old City for 14,000 baht ( $450 USD ) per month . It has a Western kitchen , a small yard , washing machine , and two air-conditioners . This price also includes excellent WiFi ( 21 mbps ) <p> Eating Out : Weve gradually steered away from eating Thai food out all the time . Although we still eat Thai food for lunch , now we enjoy fewer but more expensive Western dinners that average around 600 baht ( $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks and fruit smoothies . <p> Entertainment : Most of this expense was from our three-day mini vacation visiting the- floating bungalows and Sticky Waterfalls at the SriLanna National Park . But sometimes we like to play pool or watch a movie , too . <p> Personal Care : We treated ourselves to a massage , a great haircut , some new clothes , and books . We both signed up for gym memberships . We also had a small drop-in to the local clinic and bought some toiletries such as shampoo , razors , and hair gel . <p> Adult Beverages : What can we say ? Two or three times a week we have drinks at dinner or go out with friends . We almost always stick to the local beer and rum , which is significantly cheaper than imported alcohol . <p> Groceries : Angela cooks dinner about three times a week now , where before it was three times a month . She shops at the our local market almost every day . But this month were also guilty of going to the expensive Western import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like grass-fed cows butter , Parmesan cheese , western spices , and peanut butter . <p> Bills ( Electric , Water , &amp; Cellphone ) : We run the AC during the hottest part of the day and our fan is normally on at night . This months electric bill was just shy of 600 baht ( $20 USD ) . Our 120 baht ( $4 USD ) water bill covered what we use for showers , washing clothing , and washing dishes . We buy drinking and cooking water separately . We also both have cellphone plans for our smartphones . <p> Transportation : Our motorbike has done well and has cost us nothing in repairs . The only maintenance so far have been oil changes and washes . We bought gas this month only twice because we stayed home a lot and ended up walking to places more often . <h> June 2013 vs July 2014 <p> Alright , so our Chiang Mai monthly expenses have gone up a bit since last year . So wheres our money going ? <p> Eating Out <p> Groceries <p> Personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Household Items <p> Rent &amp; Internet <p> Weve been eating Thai food a little less and have found ourselves splurging on- Western food more often , whether its home cooked or from a restaurant . We also just happened to buy a lot of clothes and personal grooming items this month , which is n't the norm . <p> But our electric bills have gone down a lot since we downsized from a 150 sq m townhouse to a 75 sq m house . It also helps that our internet is included in the rent price . <h> Thailand vs USA Living Expenses <p> We were inspired to write this Chiang Mai monthly expense budget post after seeing how little we spent in July 2014 compared to our outrageous spending the month prior when we visited the US . <h> July 2014 Thailand vs June 2014 USA <p> Keep in mind that while we were in the US , we still had to pay our Thai rent , utilities , and phone bills . Can we just say that were glad to be back in Thailand ! <p> Were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our spending back down to $1,200 next month . We plan to focus our on energy on some projects and go out less , cook at home more and dine at Western restaurants less , and spend more time working out and studying Thai . <p> But hey , we cant beat ourselves up too much because we spent $1,500 in July . That wouldnt- even cover the price of rent at our old apartment back in the US ! <p> Planning on visiting Chiang Mai with intention of moving to it eventually . Would like to spend at least a month in Chiang Mai getting a feel for it . Need broadband internet that is relatively decent . Any recommendations on where to hang my hat ? Just one solo guy . <p> Chris and Angela I am in the process of planning to hopefully live in Chiang Mai , but in about 4-5 years time when I am about 55yrs old . I have visited many times , staying at rating Lodge , CM Bluenose and SK2 House . I fell in love with Chiang Mai the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , one of the best I have seen , many thanks .

We love hearing when new readers have a good sit down and read through of our blog . We hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot ! Chiang Mai has probably changed quite a bit since 1991 , but its still a wonderful place to be . <p> I would also love to see more about your new place and the surroundings . We should be arriving in Chiang Mai tomorrow or the next day and will be looking for a place for a few months . ( 2 or 3 bed ) also , did you find your place on your own , word of mouth or an agent ? We will be hoofing it , with 2 kids in tow , so we are excited to begin our hunt . If you have any details like areas that are good to search in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . : - ) <p> Congrats for finally making it to Chiang Mai ! A few two-bedroom serviced apartments that you should look into are : The Bliss , Green Hill Place , and Galare Thong Condo . They are all under $1000 per month and close to the Old City . We hope your family loves it here ! <p> Chris &amp; Angela I would love to see a posting about your new accomodation and neighbourhood . I can guess that life in a house offers some new challenges as well as pleasures . Hope your cat has enjoyed the move ! <p> We plan to put a post up about our house with all the details and new utility costs . We love it ! We do n't  think the cats loves it as much though . Its sealed better , so less critters get in that he can chase . Plus its smaller so he cant go zooming around it like he did the huge townhouse . : ) <p> We self insure . Although , we do have motorcycle insurance that covers our medical expenses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance can be bought for around $1000 USD a year per person ( more expensive if you want coverage in the US as part of your plan ) . <p> Its tempting to leave the AC on all day ( a very American thing to do ) but the temperatures are n't  too bad now that were in the rainy season .

@@59574702 @8574702/ <h> It Ai n't  Easy Getting Pussy Cats <p> We are not sure what to think of the experience we had shipping our cat internationally to Thailand , but to make a long story short , he made it safely here after being in transit on and off for 36 hours . For us , however , it was an emotional roller coaster filled with frustration , anticipation , and uncertainly . At one point , we even though we were getting scammed . But that is the way of Thailand , and we 've read others having similar experiences . <h> Receiving Our Cat From Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi Airport <p> Things went wrong from the beginning . We had been instructed via email to pick up the cat " in front of baggage claim number 8 and pay an import license fee of 100 baht " ( $3 ) . Sounds simple , right ? <p> Well , seeing as we incorrectly assumed that " baggage claim 8 " referred to the arriving flights at the main airport , we did- a bit of running around at the main terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride away from the airport . Fine . Rookie mistake . We found our way to the customs building , only to be approached by three Thai men who were lounging and smoking on the front steps . We pointed to our newly purchased foo-foo cat carrier and they said , " Oh , first need paperwork ! " From that point on , we went through a whirl wind of driving around the cargo area to various buildings , jumping in and out of one of the Thai mans personal truck , signing this and paying that . He obligingly guided us through the process of obtaining access permits to the cargo area , confirming the delivery of the cat and signing off on the original State-side paperwork , and having us pay an arrival/delivery fee ( 1045 baht $35 ) . We would n't have had a clue what to have done , where to go , and in what order , if we had n't  run into him and his two friends . <p> We finally made it back to the customs building and that 's where everything came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be about two hours before we got our cat , and we should wait in the lobby of this big building . Not in a processing area with other staff- working , but in an empty lobby . Sitting by an old , beat up desk . With no other people waiting for their animals . These three guys took turns sitting at the desk , reading a newspaper , and going outside to smoke on the front steps . Every once in a while , they would get a call on their cell phone , have a short conversation in Thai , briefly leave , come back with some papers , sit back down at the desk , all while assuring us our cat would be there soon . <p> After awhile , we werent so sure what was going on . Where was the real customs processing facility ? surely not in a lobby . Where there no other people waiting to pick up pets on a weekend flight ? And who exactly were these three men , although they were wearing airport personnel badges of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst moment was about an hour into the waiting period and one of the Thai men came back with some paperwork and said that it would cost **27;446;TOOLONG baht to get the cat . Well , we were quite surprised we owed any more money , as we figured the total bill had been taken care of State side with the help of my mom .

But we had our eyes on a luxury stay near Phuket thus had us whistling a different tune the resort ended up being what our entire vacation was centered around . <p> We 'd never been to Khao Lak ( and have only been to Phuket while passing through the area ) , so when we got an invitation to stay at a resort there we said yes . We 've actually stayed at JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square for the 2011 NFC Championship between the SF 49ers and New York Giants , so we were excited to experience an entirely different ball game ( pun intended ) being on a private beach in the Thai province of Phang Nga . <p> After taking a flight from Chiang Mai , we were picked up by the hotels airport shuttle at the Phuket International Airport and less than an hour and a half later pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where nature and luxury combine .

Of the many places we 've been to , whether homely guesthouses or fancier resorts , we love this little touch of Thai hospitality . <p> Shortly after checking in we were introduced to our Deluxe Lagoon Pool Access room , which , as the name implies , opens right up to their lagoon-style pool . What the name does n't  suggest is that the pool is two kilometers long . Can you believe it ? The saltwater pool snakes all over the property , covers 16,000 square feet , and even juts off into lovely little coves and shallow swim-up bars . <p> Our room was the perfect size for us . It had a king size bed featuring the classic fluffy white comforter and there was a work desk , a small coffee table , a huge lounge chair , and a day bed , too . <p> The bathroom was pretty spectacular . There was a huge tub with exotic scented bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kits including soaps , combs , toothbrushes , razors , and needle and thread you name it , they had it .

We 've never been to a place that had such a variety while simultaneously serving really good food everywhere we sat down . <p> The Ta-Krai restaurant serves Thai food in an elegant setting decorated in a traditional Thai style . It was fun sitting on the iconic triangle Thai pillows at a sunken table . Our favorite meal was the pumpkin ravioli and slow cooked lamb and polenta served at Olive , the Mediterranean restaurant . There was also a teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant , Sakura , where chefs prepared the food right in front of us . We also had their happy hour cocktails and light lunches at several of their bars , two of which are swim-up ( Infinity Pool Bar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before was dinner on the beach .

Every day features a huge breakfast spread of both Western and Asian classics alongside rotating specials at the Waterfront restaurant . Jams , baked muffins and quiches , Indian curries , omelets and eggs of many kinds , a coffee station , yogurts and fresh muesli and honeycomb , preserved meats , sliced tropical fruit and cereals were there , too . There were also freshly made sourdough pretzels , which we have n't had in ages . <h> Amenities and Activities <p> Were confident in saying that you wont be bored here .

Most items were already cut or needed minimal preparation , and the dishes they chose to prepare we also quick to make . <p> Basically , its the perfect way to spend about an hour and a half of your afternoon ( so you can spend the rest lounging on the beach ! ) while also getting plenty of food to eat . <h> Additional Perks <p> Excellent WiFi throughout the entire property and multiple devices can connect per room <p> Juniors Club for kids that have ball pit and slide , computers , pool table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fitness room featuring free weights and cardio machines <p> Join in group activities such as yoga in the morning <p> Private airport shuttle for guests to and from the property <p> The JW Marriott Khao Lak Resort &amp; Spa caters to those who are looking for peace and relaxation all in one spot , excellent service , and the beautiful beaches along the Andaman Sea just a few steps away . <h> Contact Information of JW Marriott Khao Lak Resort &amp; Spa <p> Although we are no longer doing YouTube videos , we have made the switch filming our adventures using Periscope and Facebook Live .

Just one thing with the visa information for Australia triple entry tourist visas are n't  available to Aussies , double entry is the maximum but we already get a 30 day visa exemption so Read more + <p> We live in Perth ( Western Australia ) so maybe its different but when I rang the consulate and then actually applied for the visas in Perth just the other day we were told the double entry is the longest tourist visa available to us . Thanks for the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say . Thanks . <p> Thanks for reading ! We have n't had the opportunity to stay long term down south , but knowing what things generally cost ( and using Chiang Mai as reference ) is a good tactic . We hope you love Koh Samui ! We checked on the visa thing and read that a triple e-entry can be obtained from the Thai Consulate in Brisbane . Of course , the only way to know for sure is to call . Worth checking out ! <p> I pay 25,900 baht per year all up or $809USD at todays rate . This is for an education visa through Walen and includes 180 hours of Thai classes each year . I 've done this for 5 years straight . Its the least stressful option . <p> Hi guys , another option would be an Education Visa for one year . I 'm planning to be in TH pretty soon and I will try to get this visa . I will just enroll in some course , maybe learning Thai , and then I 'm good for the whole year : ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive ? Take care : ) <p> Education visas are another alternative for staying long term . What 's great about them is that you can apply for a year extension which completely eliminates border/visa runs . This is an excellent choice for those who would love to study abroad and plan on staying in the same city for awhile . <p> Payap University goes for around 60,000 baht ( $2000 ) per semester as a full time student , which is considered 9 or more credits . CMU goes for about $1000 a year with a minimum of 6 hours per week . <p> No problem ! We came over on a triple entry tourist visas , but after Angela got a job we made a visa run to Vientiane , Laos and got one year Non-Immigrant B and O visas . Once your original Thai tourist visa is up , you will need to do a visa run and apply for a new visa at a Royal Thai Embassy or Royal Thai Consulate . It is common to do a visa run to Thailands neighboring countries , but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've heard you can get a triple entry Thai tourist visa from Singapore.

Still , if we know that well be heading back to Thailand for an extended period of time , this is a great option to have . <p> They were easy to pick up back in the states , but we think because of the serial border runners they try to make the process a little more difficult in Thailand s bordering countries . Each embassy or consulate has their own rules which constantly change to keep people on their toes . Best to get things taken care of back home : ) <p> Hi Guys , Looking to come there next January . Work outdoors in Minnesota/North Dakota and get the winters off . Would like to come from about Jan 5-mid or late March maybe even into April depending on the weather back in Minn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this every year if it works out : - ) For long term vacation , better to rent a room for 60-90 days or inexpensive hotel ? I get paid ( salaried , no OT during the crazy busy season ) so money not a big issue , but I 'm not rich by any means either . Just want to Read more + <p> Hi Keith , you will be happy to know that Thailand has serviced apartments . They act as both short and long-term rentals and are usually pretty affordable . Another option is to find a hotel that you like and see if they offer a discounted monthly rate . Youd be amazed at the deals you can find , and being that everything is so cheap it allows you to be really flexible . We are very glad that you find our blog useful . Thanks for commenting ! <p> Your info is helpful . No wonder people are confused about the visa process . A question for you : I plan on getting a retirement visa , which I believe allows me to avoid border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or convert a tourist visa once there ? Thanks guys , see ya soon . <p> Thanks , Roger ! Definitely get your retirement visa before you make the move .

@@59574708 @8574708/ <h> How to Open a Thai Bank Account <p> Opening a Thai bank account offers several benefits but foreigners often find themselves having a difficult time opening one or are unsure of what they need to be eligible for an account . Weve provided the required documents to open a Thai bank account and a list of banks that are the easiest to open an account with minimal documentation . <p> As a foreigner , there are two major categories you can fall into when opening a Thai bank account : <p> 1 . You have a work permit ( obtainable with a non-immigrant B visa ) 2 . You do not have a work permit <h> Expats with Work Permits <p> If you fall into the first group , you are eligible to open a Thai bank account at most banks . In many cases , a passport and work permit will suffice in opening a savings account . However , check with each individual bank for any additional required documentation ( i.e. , proof of resident status , certificate of residency , etc . ) <p> Walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance , and wait to be called on . Itll take an hour or less to set up an account . The bank official will make photocopies of your documents and have you sign a few forms . Do n't  forget important contact information , such as your address and phone number , too . <p> Bangkok Bank <p> Bank of Ayudhya <p> CIMB Thai Bank <p> ICBC <p> Kasikorn Bank <p> Bank of Thailand <p> Siam Commercial Bank <p> Krung Thai Bank <p> Siam City Bank <p> TMB Bank <p> UOB Bank <p> Kiatnakin Bank <p> Thanachart Bank <p> Additional fees will vary for each bank , including yearly fees , replacement ATM card fees , account cancellation fees , and ATM withdrawal fees . Interest earned per year will also vary , if offered at all . <h> Expats Without Work Permits <p> Most people fall into the second group . This includes expats possessing a non-immigrant Thai visa , including retirement , education , dependent , or a short-term Thai tourist visa . <p> Never fear ! Banks that do not need a work permit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank <p> TMB Bank <p> UOB Bank <p> In most cases , these banks want to see your passport and either a second form of identification or that you are currently residing in Thailand under a lease . <p> Either a work permit or student identification issued by local Thai institutions <p> NOTE:Weve heard wildly varying experiences from people trying to open a Thai bank account without a work permit . It may take more than one attempt because the bank staff may ask for a work permit even when its not required . We recommend speaking with bank staff that speaks English well and show them the official rules from the bank in question ( linked to above ) . Keep in mind this is Thailand ! <h> The Benefits of Opening a Thai Bank Account <h> No ATM Withdraw Fees <p> No more 150 or 180 baht charges ! <h> No Conversion Rate Fees <p> No more loss due to- 3% conversion rates , whether from an ATM withdrawal or from currency exchange . <h> Access to Thai Debit Card <p> Issued as a Visa , a Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases .

I was eligible to open a bank account under my name with a passport and a work permit . However , to open a joint account that included Chris 's name , the bank wanted a Residency Certificate ( i.e. , proof that we are living long-term in Thailand ) . <p> We did n't  have one on hand , and since it takes ten business days to get one in Chiang Mai , we made a second attempt at opening a joint account at the Kasikorn Bank a few floors up in the same mall . <p> Upon entering the bank we were asked if we had a work permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but we were never asked to show proof of it during the application process . We also did not have on hand a lease agreement or utility bill to prove we were living in Thailand . Instead , we simply wrote down our address and they accepted it . <p> It took about 45 minute to set up the account and to register two ATM cards that we received immediately . They cost an extra 500 baht each . <p> Do you plan on opening a Thai bank account ? If you 've done so or have tried , how was your experience ? <p> I opened a joint account with KrungThai Bank and found out that with KrungThai Bank you can not get online banking and you can only receive one ATM card .

Being persistent really paid off ! Going with a bilingual friend or significant other is a great tip . They can help with the nuances of the terms and conditions , or maybe push a little to help get your account approved . <p> 1 ) Does it come with online banking in English ? 2 ) Can someone from overseas simply deposit USD funds on the account ? Do they/you have to pay a fee for this ? 3 ) Is it safe ?

A few months of inactivity wont get it closed ( as from our own experience ) , and we do n't  know how a visa issue would cause someone to seize or freeze your account . This may be something you need to ask the bank directly . Thanks for commenting ! <p> We recommend contacting your Thanachart bank and asking yourself since every bank is different and because we have n't tried it ourselves with our Thai debit card in America . However , you may be able to access your money in the US but be charged an ATM fee and an international fee ( which is what we can do with our American debit card in Thailand ) . Oh , and its good practice to contact the bank anyways to let them know that you are conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security policy and freeze your card ! <p> If you 've a PayPal account , you can transfer money from that account to Thai or US Banks free ( amount has to be more than 5000Baht per transaction ) .

A few years ago there 's a method to transfer money from the US to Bangkok Bank in Thailand without a fee . Just transfer money to BKK Bank L.A.

I was originally going to set up a joint account but we were informed that with joint , you werent eligible for cyber banking . I need CB to transfer funds back home to the ol student loan . So , my husband is on his own . He ( no work permit ) had to get a document from immigration stating he is a long term resident ( had to show our lease ) .

@@59574709 @8574709/ <h> Guide for American Expats Visiting Home <p> Going home to the US for a month was not only an opportunity to visit friends and family , but it also allowed us to take care of personal business that 's difficult to do while living in Thailand . Fellow American expats visiting home , here is a list of things we recommend taking care of both before and during a visit to the US . <h> What to do Before Visiting the USA <h> 01- Purchase US Touring Auto Insurance <p> At the last minute we opted out of purchasing travelers medical insurance while in the US . We like to think were pretty healthy . <p> However , accidents do happen , and our biggest health risk would be driving . Since we could not financially afford to pay for body and vehicle damage if we were in a car crash , we signed up for travelers car insurance through USAA . At $25 per year we were both provided with full coverage . <p> We recommend American expats visiting home to call your previous car insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Expat medical insurance has various degrees of coverage ; some basic plans will not cover Europe or North America . You can be sure to pay a premium if you need coverage in the USA. <h> 02- Take Advantage of Airline Mileage Programs <p> Before moving to Thailand , we signed up for several rewards credit cards . We earned enough miles for our round-trip visit from Thailand to the US in June 2014 , as well as most of our domestic flights . What would have cost us nearly $3,450 without points cost us just over $350 . <h> Breakdown of Angelas Flights To and Around the USA <p> What credit card companies did we originally apply with ? We signed up for the Chase Southwest Premier , Chase Southwest Plus , Chase Sapphire , Citi American Airlines , and Capital One Venture cards back in Fall 2012 . Its well worth the investment for American expats visiting home . We signed up for more of them during our visit in June 2014 ! <h> 03- Update Soon-to-be-Expired Credit Cards <p> Since it can be difficult to directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a domestic address ) , we checked to see if any of our credit cards needed replacement within the next twelve months . <p> We had one that was expiring soon . So , we called two weeks prior to going home and requested a new card be shipped to a trusted family member whom we were visiting . <h> 04- Get Supporting Paperwork for a Thai Visa <p> We saw our trip to the States as an opportunity to renew our expiring Thai visas . Although many people do visa runs to neighboring countries of Thailand , we opted to do a visa run while in Washington , D.C. , USA . We made sure to have our supporting paperwork squared away before hopping on the plane . <p> TIP : It can take anywhere from two to four weeks processing time for the paperwork required to apply for some Thai visas . <h> What to Do While Visiting the USA <h> 01- Renew License ; Get an International Drivers License <p> Making sure that our licenses were up to date was one of our top priorities . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With an unexpired drivers license , we applied for an international license through AAA . All we needed was a completed application ( provided on site at AAA ) , a 2 ? x2 ? passport photo , and $15 USD . Having an international driver 's license makes it significantly easier to get a Thai drivers license ( no driving test required ! ) . <h> 02- Obtain Copies of Important Documents <p> Many documents need to be originals when applying for visas , work permits , etc . Make sure you have the originals you need and store them in a protective folder . Examples include : <p> social security card <p> birth certificate <p> marriage license <p> updated passport <p> diploma or official transcript <h> 03- Stock up on US Currency <p> USD bills come in handy when purchasing visas for some of Thailands neighboring countries , like Laos or Cambodia . Thailands ATMs do not spit out US dollars , and while its possible to get them at currency exchanges , the downsides are that : <p> You are charged roughly 3% for every dollar <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need money over a national holiday or the night before a visa run , you 'll be out of luck <p> The currency exchange booth may not have enough USDs ! <p> TIP : Make sure they are clean crisp bills . Some visa processing stations will not accept wrinkled or torn bills as form of payment . <p> Although we had one before moving to Thailand , we added Angela to our existing account and obtained a second debit card under her name . Having a second card is a nice safety net if one of ours ever got lost , stolen , or eaten by an ATM machine . <h> 05- Apply for a Thai Visa <p> Rather than enter Thailand on a visa-exempt 30 day stamp and do a visa run to a neighboring country later on , we applied for a Thai visa while we were in America . <p> Luckily , our itinerary brought us to Washington , D.C. , home to a Consular Office of the Royal Thai Embassy . We dropped off our passports , passport photos , completed applications , Thai visa paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money order and both received our new visas three days later . <p> An alternative would have been to mail everything to the nearest Royal Thai Consulate or Embassy Consular Office . It takes about two weeks processing time . <p> TIP : There are Royal Thai Consulates Located in Atlanta , Chicago , Houston , Los Angeles , New York , and Portland . <h> 06- Buy a Temporary American SIM Card <p> Although Thailand often hands out free SIM cards in airports , and you 're sure to find a cheap one at a local 7-Eleven ( which are everywhere ) , that 's not the case in the US . <p> We tried buying a SIM card in an airport . We were informed that the going rate was $0.49 per 1 Mb of data . 1 Gb of data would have cost us over five hundred dollars at that going rate ! <p> We later went to T-Mobile , and in about 20 minutes had a 1Gb SIM card with unlimited texting and calling . It cost $60 ( $50 for the 1Gb data , $10 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other carriers , like Verizon and AT&amp;T , have also begun offering contract-free services . All that 's required is an unlocked phone . The great news is that if your phone works in Thailand , its unlocked ! <h> Staying in the USA Longer than 35 Days <p> While we would love to visit friends and family longer , it is not financially feasible . There are two major penalties for American expats visiting home who stay for more than 35 days in one calendar year . <h> 01- Paying Taxes Abroad <p> If you travel outside the US for more than 330 days of the year , American expats visiting home can claim " non-resident " status . In doing so , you remain tax free on your overseas earnings up to $97,600 ( 2013 , filing single , under 65 ) . However , if you stay in the USA for more than 35 days , you must file as a resident . This means you pay taxes on anything above the filing threshold of $10,150 ( 2013 , filing single , under 65 ) . Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penalty <p> After 2014 rolled in , its mandatory that every US citizen have health insurance unless you 're outside the US for at least 330 days a year . Unfortunately , popular travelers insurance , such as BUPA and AXA often used by expats , do not cover medical treatment in the US unless you pay a hefty premium . <p> The penalty for not having insurance is 1% of your household income ( on the amount made above the filing threshold of $10,150 in 2013 ) OR $95 per person , whichever is higher . It goes up every year after that . The latter penalty applies to us , so we would pay $190 if we visited home for more than 35 days . The frustrating thing is that we would still have no health insurance ! <h> Its More than Just a Vacation for American Expats Visiting Home <p> That completes our checklist of things we took care of right before and during our trip home to the US . We highly recommend this to other American expats visiting home . Even though we all wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes you have to take care of business , too . <p> Of course , all of these items are applicable to those who have yet to move to Thailand but want to . We highly encourage everyone to be as prepared as possible before moving ( back ) to Thailand ! <p> I have the exact same question ! My husband and I are in Dubai , he works and I stay at home with the kids . I was wondering if I would be able to stay in the US for more than 35 days since I am not the source of income . Or if since we file married joint tax return , that neither of us could be there over the given time limit . Did you find out the answer ? ? I have looked everywhere . This comment was meant to be for the comment email protected made . Just wondered if she ever found out the answer <p> I would love more info on the traveler car insurance through USAA . Does that just cover you driving in the US with a rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas rentals so i do n't  have to pay the rental companies extortionate rates . Thanks ! <p> Hi . So glad we have connected . My husband and I sold everything 2 years ago and are living the travelers life . It is wonderful ! We spent 5 months this year in SE Asia and are now in an RV in the USA . Best of both worlds in our opinion . <p> This couldnt have come at a more perfect time ! I 'm gearing up to go back for a month-long trip for my uncles wedding in just two weeks . I think I 've got most of this covered , but I was wondering if you could offer any advice for my current visa situation . I am currently on a double entry tourist visa , leaving for the US on the date that the first entry expires . I was planning on coming back in on my second entry when I come back in September , but I was wondering if you think it would be smarter to Read more + <p> Hey Amanda ! I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your second entry will have expired since you 're not entering Thailand for a second time by the " Enter Before " date stamped on your visa . You will have to get a new visa while in Chicago . However , with the new immigration rules , we do n't  know if the visa office will issue you a double-entry visa or only a single entry now . Even if they do issue you a double-entry tourist visa , we have no way of knowing yet if Thailand border control will acknowledge your double entry visa Read more + <p> I hope that you guys have a good time while visiting homeland . It would be really nice , if Asian and European countries are not that far away . I would n't be still here in US , if that was the case . Thank you for all the information again . <p> We liked getting our own auto insurance because it meant that both of us could drive . Our rental company kept trying to push us to buy theirs ( and pay extra for a second driver ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even went so far as to lie and said " USAA only has liability . " Psht Bottom line is were happy we did what we did . <p> You 're welcome ! It was so nice to go to the Thai Consulars office in DC no swarming tuk tuk drivers trying to overcharge you ! It was a lot less stressful than our visa run to Vientiane , Laos last year : ) <p> Great tip on the touring auto insurance . I will definitely look into that on my next visit back . The 35 day rule is sooo important , and I do n't  think many people know about this . If this period is overstayed it can have dire consequences for expats especially now since the IRS requires that foreign bank assets be disclosed . thanks ! <p> We do n't  think enough people know about the 35 day rule . It can change your entire itinerary ! As for disclosing foreign bank assets , we understand that Thailand and the US have an agreement that they have to disclose the amounts of any US citizens bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We recommend that any US citizen with dual citizenship uses the other countrys passport when signing up for a Thai bank account to avoid Uncle Sams prying eyes . <p> Really helpful like many of your posts . I 'm curious though about how you feel about the American system for health and insurance and taxes seeing how other countries do without much of the fuss ? Having lived in libya I find the uk so tight and controlling with all their rules and all the things you have to pay . No matter people move abroad there you can enjoy the money you work to get . In the UK and the US it seems they work hard to take it all away from you . <p> Glad to hear you liked the post ! We were lucky to never have serious medical issues , and the things that werent covered by our insurance ( laser eye surgery , orthodontists ) we could afford out of pocket . But taxes good grief , we were eaten alive by them ! Its extremely frustrating that US citizens have to pay taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important to stay out of the US for more than 330 days to avoid being slammed . <p> Thanks ! Important and boooring . Sometimes we wish we werent grown ups just so that we did n't  have to worry about that kind of stuff ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 11 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

We finally made it official and took a trip to Koh Chang with a small group of friends just before high season rolled around . We only wish we had done it sooner ! <h> Trip to Koh Chang , Thailand <p> Koh Chang , pronounced Gaw Chahng , is an island in the Gulf of Thailand several hours drive southeast of Bangkok and not too far from Pattaya . Weve been told that its one of the easier islands to travel to ( you can now book tickets online to travel by- bus , train , and plane ) . After going there ourselves , we can certainly attest that it was a great first choice . <p> We vacationed for a full week in Koh Chang . The tan sand was soft , the water warm and absolutely crystal clear , the weather was beautiful , and the seafood was delicious . What more could you want in a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why many people are attracted to Koh Chang . There are a good variety of places to stay , from high-end resorts to laid back bungalows . Many are tucked within the mountains forest and blended into the nearby beaches . This was exactly what we were looking for . <p> Koh Chang seems to attract a younger crowd , somewhat similar to the backpackers we saw in Pai , but with fewer solo travelers and more couples . There were fewer families and vacationing older couples like we 've seen in Hua Hin . We also noticed that the prices in Koh Chang were cheaper than other beach towns , like Ao Nang , which is located far south in the Andaman Sea . <p> Trekking , kayaking , exploring waterfalls , and visiting nearby islands seemed to be popular outdoor activities during our trip to Koh Chang . Those , plus spending the day sun tanning and swimming at any of the many beaches along the west side of the island . It 's not uncommon to hear reggae music playing from the bars hugged by the sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a week in Koh Chang , here 's a collaboration of our favorite places we visited : <h> Koh Chang Accommodations : Nature Beach Resort <p> After spending time at the beach , wandering through- town and the little shops , and exploring the mountainside , we were happy to crash at our waterfront bungalow at Nature Beach Resort near Lonely Beach . <p> We could just make out the sights and sounds of the water from our front steps . We also loved that the resort had a massage shop , restaurant and bar , pool table , and offered kayak rentals . We spent four nights there for only 1100 baht ( 35 USD ) per night . A steal we tell ya ! <p> We chose the air-conditioned bungalow , but Nature Beach Resort also has fan bungalows for around 15 USD a night . Our room was clean , tastefully decorated , and had big windows that let in tons of natural light . <h> Koh Chang Seafood Restaurant : Lomtalay Seafood <p> We could n't wait to get our fill of seafood during our trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ate shrimp , squid , fish , or crab nearly every meal . One of our favorite restaurants we dined at , recommended by one of our friends , is Lomtalay Seafood . Its at the southern end of the island , halfway down the pier at Bang Bao Bay . <p> Steamed lemon fish , sweet and sour fried fish , grilled squid , yellow curry crab , huge garlic prawns , and crab fried rice made for an awesome dinner . After the splurge , with a few big beers and fresh whole coconuts thrown into the mix , we split the bill with our friends ; the cost for the two of us was 950 baht ( 30 USD ) . <h> Koh Chang Hangout : Easy House <p> This cluster of bungalows is exactly the type of place we were looking for to relax . Constructed of rough-cut tree limbs and raised from the forest floor , these bungalows completely immersed us in the nearby jungle . <p> A group of friends got together , and knowing the owner , had ourselves an afternoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at the bungalows . <h> Koh Chang Activity : Exploring Khlong Phlu Waterfall <p> Much of Koh Changs land is part of the Mu Koh Chang National Park . This park has several waterfalls and we opted to visit one for an easy day trip . Once at the waterfalls entrance , the hike is a half kilometer through a rocky forest trail . We were greeted by a tall waterfall and a ravine where we could go swimming . <p> The surrounding rocks are a bit precarious , but once we found a relatively smooth spot , we settled down on our mat , had some snacks , and eventually got into the cool water . <p> We had just talked about the Thai dual price system , and lo and behold , this waterfall had it . Chris showed his Thai drivers license and got the Thai rate of 40 baht ( $1.50 USD ) . I had left mine back at the hotel . The foreigner price ? 200 baht ( $6.50 USD ) . Womp womp . <h> A Note about Getting Around Koh Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain . And with mountains come very curvy and steep mountain roads . <p> Even as experienced motorbike riders , we were discouraged by the overwhelming number of 180 degree turns , 30 degree inclines and declines , lack of shoulder , and drop offs on Koh Changs main road . You definitely need absolute control of steering , breaking , and shifting ! <p> Although motorbike rentals can be easily found along the main road ( and its even possible to rent one at the dock after being dropped off by the ferry ) we highly recommend using a taxi instead . They are easy to hail from the main road or request from the front desk at a hotel or bar . <p> Koh Changs taxies are pretty recognizable big white trucks with a large TAXI sign on them . They have covered beds with benches in the back and are pretty similar to the red songthaews we see in Chiang Mai . Short rides cost about 50 baht per person , long rides will cost closer to 100 baht . <h> Trip to Koh Chang Total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it into perspective , our week-long trip on a tropical island only cost 65 USD per person per dayincluding travel costs from Chiang Mai and back ! <h> Is it Worth Taking a Trip to Koh Chang ? <p> If you can spare time to travel there , we say go for it ! The island is beautiful , one of the cheaper places we 've been to , and totally accessible . <p> We loved the variety of restaurants and easy-going beach vibe . And the beaches are some of the prettiest and cleanest we 've ever seen . The views of the coastline are certainly picturesque , whether you 're on the mountainside drive or standing with your feet in the sand . <p> Want to relax at the beach without vendors pestering you or succumbing to high touristy prices ? Come here and spend a few days with magnificent views . <p> For the short term ( 1-3 months ) yes , but for the long term no . Its nice to relax near the water , but it does n't  have the infrastructure for us to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and laid back living with minimal amenities , it may work for you . We definitely encourage your to check it out on a mini vacation before moving there . <p> Very nice ! If I ever go to Koh Chang , I think I can make it even cheaper because I do n't  mind a fan room if its only me . Also , I cant tell you how much money my Thai I 'd has saved me compared to my farang friends . Last week I went to a Muay Thai fight ( Lumpinee Stadium ) and they charged my German friend 1000 baht , whereas I only paid 240 baht . <p> Especially in the high season , when its the coolest time of the year , a fan room is the way to go . In some places , you may even want an extra blanket ! You were right to use your Thai I 'd . Paying $22 less than your friend .. that price difference is outrageous ! <p> We were thrilled to see super clean beaches , and the water was just so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hair more expensive than Chiang Mai . Koh Chang is such a good find . <p> Been there several times myself , I can understand your apprehension about motorcycling round the island , but traffic is never really heavy . Hiring a motorcycle not only to get from A to B , but just for the sake of riding it and taking in all the sights , stopping at the viewpoints etc can be a great day out in its own right . <p> Awesome ! I just read about Koh Chang on another blog recently and was dreaming of visiting when I get back to Thailand . Ooooh ! I am so jealous ! Great pics , great post as usual ! You both keep me inspired and motivated . <p> We took the long route ( flight from CM to Bangkok , bus ride from Bangkok to Trat ) , but starting in October , Bangkok Airways offers flights from Chiang Mai to Trat ( the mainland town across from Koh Chang ) . Then take a taxi from the airport to the ferry . The ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket costs more , but saves you a ton of time compared to a bus ride . Go for it ! <p> Absolutely , although you may have trouble finding online listings advertising as such . The best thing to do is choose a few good places and go there in person or call them for rates . Most places have weekly and monthly deals , but you just have to ask . A word of warning monthly rates may not be available during high season ( October February ) at some places , simply because they can make more money from daily turnovers , and the customer demand is certainly there . Good luck ! 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 2 years 9 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

Back in the States , we used to simply whip out a debit or credit card and make a purchase with one , smooth swipe .

We still find ourselves drinking coffee , but we 've had to modify our morning coffee-making ritual a bit . <p> Here in Thailand , we have n't readily found ground or whole coffee beans at the major grocery stores . We 've also noticed that among the display of small home appliance , coffee percolators are nowhere to be found . There are plenty of microphones ( karaoke , anyone ? ) and rice cookers , but no coffee makers . And its not a question of whether coffee is or is not commonly consumed in Thailand because there are cafes everywhere . <p> Instead , what weve commonly found is an array of instant coffee and espresso .

Oh , the simplicity of it all ! <p> Two days prior to leaving Bangkok , we made a reservation with Thai Airways and let them know that we would be bringing a cat .

@@59574717 @8574717/ <h> A Tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok <p> Aside from a few drop-ins at a local clinic and a late night semi-emergency visit to the veterinarian for our cat , weve never had to step foot in a hospital in Thailand . But that does n't  mean were not curious to know what would happen- if we seriously needed to see a doctor . So when we were invited on a tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok , which is considered one of the best hospitals in all of Southeast Asia , we could n't turn it down . <p> Healthcare was n't a major determining factor for us when we decided to move to Thailand , but many prospective expats want to know how well the- medical system abroad- compares to that of their home country . <p> Admittedly- medical- standards do vary wildly in Thailand . There are some places that will cause some raised eyebrows . On the flip side there are also destination hospitals that meet Western standards , if not exceed them . After our tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital ( pronounced buhm-run-grahd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our medical dreams can- come true . <p> Bumrungrad is unlike any hospital or clinic we 've been to in America . Mind you that we once lived near Washington D.C. , so we werent going to- some potentially underfunded clinic in the boonies . Goodbye to- the harsh antiseptic smells , sterile hallways , and unflattering fluorescent lighting and hello to wall paintings , plush lounge areas , and attentive- services . <p> Wait a minute , did we just step into a hospital or is this a high-end hotel ? <h> Patient Services <p> After confirming that we were indeed in a hospital , we headed up to the 10th floor Sky Lobby Patient Registration Center in the Bumrungrad International Clinic ( BIC ) building . This is where the magic begins for every prospective patient . <p> There we were greeted by medical coordinators who are responsible for registering new patients and giving them a hospital card before setting up an appointment . <p> TIP : - - Bringyour passport when registering at the hospital and your hospital card ( given to all registered patients ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a referral from your- primary care physician to be seen by a specialist at Bumrungrad . <p> If you need to be seen right away , a medical coordinator will direct you to the clinic or- wellness center best for you based on your symptoms. - Doctors accept- walk-ins during clinic hours ( 9am to 5:30pm ) while the 15th floor General Medicine Clinic accepts walk-ins until 8pm . Otherwise , making an appointment is encouraged- to avoid waiting . <p> here 's something totally worth mentioning : as an expat or otherwise foreign patient , dealing with visas and traveling arrangements is part of the not-so-fun responsibilities- when getting medical care overseas . Just around the corner of the 10th floor Sky Lobby Patient Registration Center is their- Business Center that offers help with traveling and medical visa arrangements for inpatients if needed . <p> For example , representatives can- help you get to and from your hotel and even offer you tours of Bangkok while you recover from treatment . They can also- extend your visa during your recovery period if needed and any accompanying spouses or companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not something we wouldve worried about if we were receiving medical treatment in our home country , but that 's the type of above and beyond customer care and service that can really make a world of a difference for foreign patients . <h> Designed for Efficiency <p> We are advocates of efficiency , so when Bumrungrad mentioned a centralized lab , a database for assisting in personalized cancer treatments , and a- robotic pharmacist , and they got an A+ in our books . <p> For starters , Bumrungrad does in-house lab testing . None of this " Let me send every- blood sample , biopsy , and MRI scan to a third-party lab that will take weeks to get results . " Instead , almost all- are done at the hospital- and the testing is completed and results are returned in less than an hour . There are a few tests that are sent away , but if that happens- you 'll be told when to expect the- results , which are delivered by email or can be picked up in person . <p> Then we went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers specimens from the different clinics and centers on- all floors of the hospital to the centralized lab for testing . You know , the same pressure-dropping tubes used at banks when you 're depositing and withdrawing cash ? - Samples zip right to the lab and technicians start testing immediately . <p> Bumrungrad- also uses a cognitive computer technology known as " Watson for Oncology . " Its a massive database used by oncologists that takes into account a- cancer patients symptoms and combines that with information from medical literature and the knowledge and experience from medical experts before providing a specialized treatment . This is the first of its kind and a huge leap forward for cancer patient care . <p> Further down the line is a pill dispensary system that is done by a robot . Inpatients meds are ordered by a doctor but then the task of dispensing and packaging them in single-use dosages are done so by a fully automated drug management system dubbed " Pharmacy Robot . " This robot- also triple-checks drug interactions and dosages before popping everything into little plastic baggies to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This frees up the pharmacists to do more important tasks and patients know they are always getting the right medications . <p> And about medications , when a doctor hands over- a prescription , you do n't  have to go to a- third-party pharmacy after leaving the hospital . You can go directly to any of the pharmacies ( one on each floor ) and get your prescription filled right then and there before leaving the hospital . <p> This is not to say American or European hospitals do n't  have on-site pharmacies because they do . But what about all the medication that your dentists , dermatologists , and ophthalmologists prescribe ? Do these physicians have their own pharmacies on hand to give you your medication before- you leave their offices ? Nope , at least not from any of our experiences back home . <p> Which leads us to our next point <h> Treatments and Centers <p> A variety of comfortable waiting rooms for patients . <p> What we found interesting was the incredible variety of services Bumrungrad offers under one roof . When we think hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set after a car accident , and open heart surgery . But Bumrungrad also has dermatologists , dentists , and- allergists all in one place. - In fact , Bumrungrad has over 36 different medical centers and programs ranging from nutritional consulting and pediatric care to fertility treatments to evaluating sleep quality . There is no need to drive from one part of town to another when you need treatment because its all in one spot . <p> Even with all these services , Bumrungrad is best known for its tertiary care . Doctors are trained in very- complex procedures or treatments and use very specialized equipment. - This is especially so in the following medical centers , which can be remembered by the acronym CONGO : <h> ( Sur ) Passing the Bar on Western Standards <p> We did n't  go into a surgery room , but we snapped a picture of this display showing what its like inside . <p> We learned that Bumrungrad is the first hospital in the entire continent of Asia to become Joint Commission International ( JCI ) accredited . Its seen as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment. - So although the hospital is in Thailand , it meets American medical and building safety standards with flying colors . <p> Of the 1200+ doctors and 900+ nurses employed at Bumrungrad , many have either earned their doctorate or conducted their post-graduate training overseas and are now practicing back in Thailand . Rest assured the expertise- is there . <p> The medical staff also speaks both- Thai and English . In the event that neither is your native language , Bumrungrad has 150 interpreters on duty for 25 different languages . These interpreters- have medical backgrounds and are trained in medical terminology and conditions and help in translating what the doctors say . <h> Competitive Medical Costs <p> A sore area for many patients is the cost of medical care . Even though Bumrungrad emphasizes top-rate quality over pricing , they are still able to offer their medical services- at affordable rates . <p> Not only do medical procedures often cost less in Thailand than in the bureaucratic-filled Western hospitals , Bumrungrad does not impose- the much-feared- dual pricing system . As a matter of fact , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients . We were also told that prices are also consistent whether you are paying through an insurance plan versus- out-of-pocket . <p> It was refreshing to learn that payment is expected- on the way out the- door and the process is n't dragged out through claims . <p> What really got our attention is that- Bumrungrad posts medical costs online so you can price compare . Thats- practically unheard of in the US , but you can get real cost estimates- for common medical procedures before stepping foot into their- facility . <h> Schedule a Tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital <p> Anyone can take a free tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital . If you 're interested in seeing their facilities firsthand , go to the Customer Service Desk on the ground floor of the BIC building or call the service desk at the number below , particularly for large groups . <p> And lastly , although Bumrungrad International Hospital is in the heart of Bangkok , its easily accessible by both private and public transportation . Its at the crossroads of two major expressways and there is- a- parking garage available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free shuttles also make the short trip between the hospital and the Nana Station of the BTS ( known also as the Sky Train ) and there are also shuttles from the- Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi International Airports to the hospital , both less than 30 kms away . <p> Hopefully our tour of Bumrungrad International Hospital sheds some light on the quality- and type of treatments available in Thailand .

Thank you so much for this information . <p> If you are looking for insurance while in Thailand , our contact at Bumrungrad recommends obtaining it through an international insurance company rather than a local Thai insurance company , particularly if you have a pre-existing condition ( because chances are you will not be covered ) . A few companies that offer medical coverage plus some special coverage for traveling and activities are World Nomads , Cigna , and Aetna .

Even when you eat a clear soup ( Water with chicken flavor ) they charged you full service.I paid 3500bath for 4 clear soup and 4 normal meal.Thank you . <p> We asked Bumrungrad about the price of their medications . It turns out the reason they are higher than if you were to get them at your corner pharmacy is because 1 ) you are having an expert prescribe them to you without you self medicating ( risk involved ) and 2 ) the hospital guarantees that the med are not counterfeit ( which does happen here ) .

As far as short term visits home , we have some coverage in the US . <p> Nice article folks !

As for insurance , my Federal Government Blue Cross/Blue Shield works almost exactly the same in Thailand as in the USA and payment can be arranged for both out patient and in patients .

In the rooms you can choose from Thai , Japanese , Western , Vegetarian and Halal for each meal . For example I Western food for breakfast Thai for lunch and Japanese for dinner today !

@@59574718 @8574718/ <h> Taxi , or Not Taxi , That Is The Question <p> Public transportation involving a taxi or a tuk-tuk is truly an experience in Thailand . Relative to the States , a metered taxi is quite affordable . For example , a 28 km ( 17 mile , 30 minute ride ) from the BKK airport to our hotel in Bangkok cost us between 180-250 baht ( $6-8 ) . Not bad , not bad . <p> Neon colored taxis and three-wheeled tuk-tuks fill the streets nearly as much as private cars and motor bikes do . On the main drag in Bangkok ( Sukhumvit Road ) and any smaller adjoining streets ( Soi ) , you can bet that every street corner someone is calling to you " Tax-ee tax-ee ! Forty baht , anywhere ! " Those cabbies are out to hustle you ! <p> The best advice we- can give is to always request a metered taxi . Always . A metered taxi provides the assurance that you are not going to be ripped off , often two or three times the true rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices for a ride . As a tourist , 200 baht ( $6.50 ) seems like a reasonable price to go a mile or two down the road until you realize that it should cost closer to 60 baht ( $2 ) . Doh ! Do that a few times a day and soon you 'll be burning through cash simply to get from point A to point B instead of spending that money on something more worthwhile . If you 're going to take a taxi , approach one that says TAXI METER on its dome light . In fact , never agree take a taxi if a random driver approaches you first , unless you specifically ask to put on the meter ( godt meetah nah kah ) and he agrees to it . <p> Ok , so riding in a tuk-tuk once or twice never hurt anyone , and it is a really nice experience seeing the hustle-bustle of the city with the warm wind blowing in your face , especially at night . If you do decide to take a tuk-tuk , do not agree to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fun bartering with the driver ! <p> Hey ! Good to hear your cat has made it safely , but what a hassle to get him ! I have seen tuk-tuks on travel show , and it looks like they would be fun to ride in : ) Maybe not so much fun for the person " driving " them tho ..

@@59574719 @8574719/ <h> Five Things to Get Used to in Thailand <p> Whether they are due to environmental , economical , or transportation factors , we just have to laugh ! - Here are some things to get used to shortly after moving from Tieland to Thailand . <h> Five Things To Get Used to in Thailand <h> 01 - Do n't  Bother Styling Your Hair <p> Guys and gals , this applies to everyone . Do n't  spend too much time on doing your hair for the day gelled , pomaded , braided , bunned , whatever because its going to get messed up after putting on a helmet . And because I 'm a safety freak and wont go anywhere without a helmet , I have resorted to only a handful of hairstyles , mostly ones that take all of five seconds to do , or at the very least , can be easily touch up after pulling my helmet off . Pinterest , love of my life , your cute hair style ideas are of no use to me now . - Chris broke down and just started shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The Soles of Your Feet Will Always Be Dirty <p> Invest in a pair of house slippers ! Between the lack of carpets and rugs " catching " dirt , walking barefoot in the house ( wearing socks is too hot ) , dust particles settling in from the open windows ( especially during the smoky season ) , and having residual dirt from walking around outside ( unless you wear full-coverage shoes ) , our feet are always dirty . Our short-term solution is to keep a washrag nearby , but we still need those- pair of house slippers ! <h> 03 - Good Luck Getting That Large Object Home on Your Motorbike ! <p> So far we 've been able to handle several larger shopping sprees to the local Tesco ( aka , Super Wal-Mart ) thanks to the large under-the-seat storage area in our motorbike . However , as the passenger , I have to hold on to purchases that do n't  fit . I am proud to say that I 've ridden on the back of our bike while carrying a mop and a broom during one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my biggest accomplishment has been holding onto a 17 gallon trashcan . On the freeway . Yes , you just saw a little white girl riding- Thai style . <h> 04 - The Mosquitoes Will Find You <p> Our dreams of having a BBQ and sitting outside during the evenings were kind of shot when we realized that mosquitoes are everywhere . After moving out of our 6th floor studio apartment at Ban Jed Yod ( where the mosquitoes did n't  find us ) , we have- the opposite experience at our ground level townhouse , both outside and inside . As a result , we have a freshly stocked arsenal of bug spray , those little smelling candles/spiral bug repellent things , and a zapper bat ! <h> 05 - Western Food is Expensive <p> There is a big price difference in Western food compared to Thai food . Although American food is inexpensive compared to back home ( say , $5 for a cheeseburger , side of fries , and a drink at a sit down restaurant ) , a $1 plate of Thai street food fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often getting dinner from Thai street food vendors and spending only $4 ( 120 baht ) total for dinner , where as before we spent closer to $15 ( 500 baht ) . Now that we 've settled in , we treat ourselves to western food only every once in a while . Hey , freshly stir-fried chicken and veggies is healthier than a pizza anyways ! <p> If you plan on moving out of your home country to a place completely new there will definitely be things to get used to . - Most likely the things you thought would be hard to deal with wont be , and the things you never thought about will sneak up to get you . - It reality , its all part of the adventure , so we just take it all in stride and adjust . <p> Ummmmm hope you wont mind or be offended , your photo on the right riding the motorbike , your hairline is receding , how the heck you got your hair back ( on the right photo / right widget ) . My hairline is receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find a solution . <p> No worries . I do n't  have a receding hairline ( yet ) or a big secret to combat baldness . It was just really sunny that day and I had a very short haircut . We agree though , I do look like like I am balding there : ) <p> The bug zapper ( I 'm thinking tennis-like thing ) is an amazing invention . When we lived in Korea , I would have gone insane without it . The mosquitoes in Asia are relentless . Thank you bug-zapper inventor . Thank you . <p> Haha ! Oh boy can I relate to one and 2 ! My feet got so incredibly dry and black from constant flip flops . Its insane too how much I got used to the flip flop removal when entering homes . Its a move my feet were programmed to ! <p> Im resigned to the fact my feet are permanently dirty that bit is OK . I 've not switched to a cheap street food diet and I 'm sure I spend more on food that people who eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like cook . Also its not usually easy to get vegetarian food from the street stalls , if it was I 'd be more likely to eat there . <p> If eating healthy is important to you and you like to cook , its well worth spending the extra money . We understand about the limited vegetarian options from street stalls . Asking for no meat is pretty straightforward , although many dishes are all meat and sauce/herbs , so you are SOL . If you do n't  want things like fish sauce or chicken broth , that 's much harder ! <p> Haha ! Number 1 and 2 are so true ! You literally can not have a hairstyle under a helmet , besides helmet-head ( which is reaaaally stylish ) . Also , what is the deal with everything being covered in dust a few hours after dusting ? Seriously , my apartment has it out for me I feel you on the rest of the list too , but 1 and 2 are my worst . <p> Thanks for the kind words . You 're right about the pizzamuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , but luckily we have found an excellent place in Chiang Mai that offer 150 Baht Pizza Wednesdays : ) <p> I know what you mean about the price diff b/w local and US food ! We eat Indian food for lunch and dinner most nights and its much cheaper . Weve eaten more Indian food in the past 2 months than in my entire life . It does make me enjoy American food even more than in the StatesI would have turned my nose up at Pizza Hut before , but I was pretty happy to have it for dinner tonight : ) <p> I see you are acclimating very well to life in Chiang Mai , having survived Song Kran . I agree with you that there is no better bargain than Thai street food . Have you acquired that Thai taste for green papaya salad ? I like it , but had to watch that they did not slip any of those little black crabs into mine . If you like German food I would suggest Hofbrauhaus ( right off the main street of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places but the food is excellent and service is too . Your blogs make me Read more + <p> We enjoyed ourselves during Songkran . I can not believe how many people that were there ! ! ! <p> I personally love som dtum , but I 've only had it with the little dried shrimp . One of my best meals was made on the beaches in Krabi som dtum and a freshly grilled corn on the cob .

@@59574720 @8574720/ <h> Sell It , Donate It , Trash It ! <p> Since making the move , we have been asked a lot about how exactly we were able to sell everything . This is just the beginning to how we got rid of everything we owned in six months , paid off our debt , and walked away with more than $27,000 from our sales . <p> Before we took the plunge and moved out of the country , we had to get rid of our stuff . Sometimes it was discouraging looking around our Northern Virginia apartment and seeing the stuff we had accumulated over the last four years , knowing that we had to get rid of everything except for a handful of things to take with us . The mental image of whittling down our belongings to a few checked bags was also daunting and it made us question whether or not we could do it all before our big move out of the country . <p> We cleared a designated room and began sorting and taking pictures <p> Yes , we felt overwhelmed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke down the task by focusing on the method of getting rid of each object : Sell it , donate it , or trash it . First , we focused most of our time and energy on selling our stuff online or via second-hand stores and yard sales . By focusing on selling , we were able to maximize the amount of money we earned through nearly 200 individual sales , which went directly into our travel fund . Second , anything we could n't sell we donated to friends , family , and local charities . Last , things that had seen better days simply got trashed . The best thing was , we were able to reach our goal and successfully got rid of everything the night before we moved our of the apartment . <h> Sell It <p> Most of our time and energy went to selling our stuff before moving out of the country . We sold the majority of our items through Craigslist , an online classifieds website which is perfect for selling electronics , household items , and anything too big or too expensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington DC ( a major Craigslist hub ) we had a high rate of potential buyers responding to our ads . <p> We miss our big comfy patio chairs , but we have no regrets <p> On the flip side , we sold small , yet expensive items ( jewelry , college textbooks , etc ) through sites like eBay , half.com , etc , since the cost of shipping did n't  cancel out the profit ; those sites also broadened the scope of potential buyers from the local DMV ( Washington DC , Maryland , and Virginia area ) to the entire United States . <p> List items together that have a good chance of selling as a group <p> We also participated in community yard sales and were pleasantly surprised at the knickknacks and cheap household items we sold . And rather than dropping off a bag of name brand clothing at the Goodwill , consignment shops bought several dozen pieces of both mens and womens clothing , shoes , and accessories . We ended up taking every dollar earned from the items we sold and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulting in $15,000 in cash from household items and additional $12,500 from our car . <p> A couple of the 135 items we sold on Craigslist <h> Donate It <p> After sifting through most of our sellable items , we ended up giving things away to friends and family . We gave away clothes that were in still good condition but unwanted by the consignment shops to friends and family who wanted them . Any half-empty bottle of cleaning supplies , odd-ball cooking utensils , and dry goods were shared between parents and college-aged siblings . Anything else we donated to charities , such as Goodwill and Purple Heart , and were actually give a tax write-off for the estimated value of the items donated . We also donated our books to the local library . <p> Chris was very happy to get rid of all of his work clothes <h> Trash It <p> If at first we tried to sell something and then again trying to donate it and there were no takers , we just threw it away . This included the old broom and dustpan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ripped ) linens from college ? Toss . Old Christmas wreath ? Outta here ! Our only advice is to make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to make multiple trips to the dumpster . Trust me , you have more " trash " in your house than you think . Sorry , we did n't  take any pictures of our trash . <h> And the result ? <p> By the end our friends would joke and say things like " I bet you 're at home sitting on milk crates " to which we responded with " No , but we do have a fully functional neon orange five gallon bucket . " <p> By breaking the huge task of selling our belongings into more manageable steps , we were able to get rid of everything about six months after we started the task . Yes , it was time-consuming and inconvenient at times ( we joked that it was practically a second job ! ) , but it was incredibly rewarding in the end when we met our goal of fitting everything into two checked bags and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , trash it " just skims the surface on how to get rid of your stuff . There is more to come in future posts . We have some great tips to share for those of you who want to sell your stuff through yard sales and Craigslist ! If you are planning to move within the next six months our best advice is getting organized and start today . This will give you more precious time with friends and family before you leave . <p> How did you deal with things like photgraphs ? I have a bigger task in that we have a 6 bed cluttered house , a love of books and vinyl , too much kitchen equipment and also spent most of last year dealing with my moms stuff ( nearly there ) . I am looking at a 12 to 18 month timeline . The photos are both mine and my mothers and go back 80 years in some cases , post cards from the 40s letters from before WW2. the list goes on . <p> Hi Coral , sounds like you you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a lot of sacrifices , but things such as military and college awards and important photos were put into totes and given to our parents for safe keeping . Maybe a close friend or relative could keep things for you , or you could look into keeping your things in climatized storage somewhere . Best of luck ! <p> We have been going through and **25;475;TOOLONG things since April ! We have turned our stuff into $15,000 so far and we have LOADS left ! You are so right that we have more trash in our house than we could imagine . I have filled 4 large waste cans with just useless stuff that is n't worth anything . Its quite liberating ! <p> Great that you managed this , but it must have taken one hell of a lot of time and planning ! I have all sorts of stuff I do n't  need in my garage . Its been there one year already while I went travelling and its staying there for another year as I 'm moving to Sydney soon ! I wish I 'd got round to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was very exhausting all in all . Our personal lives and schedules were thrown for a loop as we had people coming by almost every night to buy something . As far as planning went , we sorted , inventoried , and met people as the responded to our posts . It definitely taught us to be flexible and in the end it was all well worth it . Hopefully you can cash in on some of that stuff soon ! <p> Good for you guys ! I cant believe how much junk we have accumulated from just living in Taiwan for two years . Our apartment came furnished and I 'm still resisting the daunting task of organizing and trying to sell the plethora of things we 've accumulated . Youve inspired me to start organizing now <p> That is great guys ! Yea , it is difficult not to get comfortable and start falling back into our hold hoarding ways haha . We have to remind ourselves that things will be easier if we remain light , agile , and flexible . A spreadsheet is key along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both the best it you new project : ) <p> Hi , Ellen ! You should definitely hold onto keepsakes . We each kept one plastic tote full of personal items that we could n't bring ourselves to part with . We also kept 1 tote full of all of our important documents . We were able to get Angelas parents to hold onto these for us for the time being . Just do n't  use this as an excuse to keep excessive amounts of stuff : ) <p> Yeah , I actually saw Angela and Chris spreadsheet of stuff they were selling , and it was mind blowing ! Ca n't believe how organized they were ! Damn , I need to sell my stuff in the basement so I do n't  have to ever work again and move to Thailand ! : ) <p> Yea , grouping is good . Editing and stitching pics together also worked well when craigslist only allowed you to have 4 pics per posts . We also recommend having 4 or 5 different accounts so you can blast your item to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ) . It is the only way to sell your stuff in a hurry , as we quickly found out . : ) <p> Thanks , Dave . We are having a blast , and hoping to better acquaint ourselves with our readers more and more as time goes on . Through the next posts in the series we will try to breakdown the specific details of how we tackled this challenge . Organization is definitely key ! Safe cycling my friend . <p> That is one way to definitely light a fire under your butt ! We booked our one way flights with our miles about 2 months prior and it really kicked our determination to get rid of the last few items into full throttle .

We zeroed in on Chiang Mai and figured out what we needed to do to get there . The idea to move over-seas started out just for fun , almost casual . We changed our lifestyle bit by bit .

What Do You Mean " No Cats " Allowed ? <p> Four days after moving in , we were approached by the very friendly manager on duty , who said , " The owner likes pets very much , but does n't  like cats because they are dirty .

Well , they 're in luck because we do n't  have a fetish for dynamite ! <p> We find it a bit bothersome that we were asked to leave although we did not breach the signed contract . In fact , the owner broke the contract himself by kicking us out at the end of the month ( ten days ) , since the lease requires 30 days written notice if " either party desires to terminate the contract prior to its- expiration " .

With all of the wedding planning this was actually the first time we were able to take a weekend road trip this summer . We both decided to leave work at 11:30AM on Friday . Being that we are now suffering from a bit of senioritis , we inadvertently took the more inconsiderate route and let our bosses know about our plans to leave work early about an hour prior to our departure . Yes , this was n't the wisest decision we could have made , but it was a choice that made our short lived freedom seem that much sweeter as we took off down I-95 . <p> The drive went by fine , and considering it was Labor Day weekend we avoided traffic for the most part . We pulled into the driveway at my grandparents house at around 7:15pm . We were met at the door with hugs , and then told we have 2 minutes to change into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at 7:40pm .

It was called the " Woohoo " and my grandfather was quick to exclaim " I hope I get some woohoo later on tonight " .

He described Chiang Mai as having mostly dirt roads and dirt cheap village style accommodationsoh and the tons and tons of snakes . Some of which he described as the size of logs that stretched out across the dirt roads . My grandfather has a unique way of telling his war stories . He gives you the no nonsense unfiltered version that combines the humor with the unpredictable horror of the Vietnam War . Having served in the Army as well I can really appreciate that .

We spent the rest of the weekend eating all the food we would never touch back at home , and had a little too much to drink .

The weekend went by fast , and we know the next month will be over and the wedding here before we know it .

Mae Salong is also known for its annual cherry blossom festival from December 28th to January 2nd . We look forward to being able to check it out this year . <h> Our Trip to Mae Salong <p> As we crawled onward from Chiang Rai through the sometimes unnervingly twisty and steep Northern Thailand mountains , past a partial road collapse , we began to see bits and pieces of the Chinese tea producing village of Mae Salong . Though we arrived during the day , it was noticeably small , quiet , and serene . As we later discovered , it only takes about ten slow driving minutes to pass through the village on the main two lane road . <p> Arriving at our home for the evening we were breathless as we peered out over the perfectly formed valley running parallel to the Northern side of the village . Just standing there looking over the edge did n't  feel real . <p> We admit , the curious thought of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these picturesque hills skipped its way across our minds for a few moments. - This place was even quieter than our recent trip to Pai . Actually , during most of our trip to Mae Salong we felt like we were the only people for miles around . <p> Our bungalow at the Maesalong Mountain Home was cozy , equipped with a comfortable mattress , - a rattan mat , two large windows that opened up wide to the mountains , and a large western style bathroom with hot water . Also included was an extra thick comforter that would prove to keep us nice and warm during the cool northern Thailand night ahead of us . <p> After we were checked in we decided that we should head back up to the restaurant to watch the sunset over the village . We had no idea what we were in for as we step out of our door onto the walking path . <p> The green , blue , purple , and pink vistas were incredible sights to see . That , paired with the cool mountain air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had parted with just a couple of hours earlier . Even the resident puppy was impressed . <p> As the sun set , the girls grabbed an extra layer and we all sat down in the open air restaurant to a traditional Yunnan meal and a couple of large Singha beers . We were so hungry and the food was so delicious that nobody remembered to snap a couple of photos of the feast . <p> After chatting about our lives back in our home countries and stuffing ourselves with spicy Chinese goodness , we retired to our respective bungalows for the night . <p> The next morning we woke up with our trip to Mae Salong coming to an end . We enjoyed some tea at the restaurant , but knowing that they did n't  serve an expansive breakfast we headed to Sweet Mea Salong , a small cafe on the edge of a hill just a little ways into the village . Once there we enjoyed a couple of different things on the menu . <p> After we were all just a little too caffeinated , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our trip to Mae Salong was over , but we told ourselves that we would definitely be back soonpossibly for an extended stay. - Wed like to thank- Jmayel and Sacha for a wonderful trip . <p> This looksamazing . I really would like to see some nature and get away from city life for a day or two . I was in Bangkok for a week and now am in Chiang Mai for 2 . I was just looking over this and Pai on here . Great posts ! I wish I had the convenience of a car , but will have to rely on buses . I hope I can figure something like this out . I want to see more of Thailand than just the city , although Chiang Mai is pretty interesting . Great blog . <p> Once you get in to the quiet mountains in Northern Thailand , the scenery is really spectacular . Were glad you 've chosen to check out Pai and Mae Salong ( and do n't  forget Chiang Dao ! ) during your trip . Even though taking your own vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy to take . Before you arrive in town , you can always call your hotel and have them arrange a cab to pick you up from the bus station and chauffeur you around during your stay . Have fun ! <p> This looks utterly incredible ! Northern Thailand is so insanely beautiful and I 'd love to explore more of it some day . When we were there back in June we had a motorbike and had big plans of exploring all over the countryside on two wheels , but the weather had other plans : we made it to Chiang Rai and into Myanmar so that we could extend our visas , but we were thoroughly soaked as a result . The unrelenting torrents of rain made us cut short the journey back to Chiang Mai so we missed out on so much of this . One day ! <p> This trip was definitely among the most beautiful places we 've been to in Thailand . We are so lucky that our friends showed us this amazing spot in Northern Thailand during our road trip . We do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We feel your pain ! We have had our own experience with a long motorbike ride in the rain . Oh wait , two ! It wipes all the energy out of you and eats into travel time . We hope you make it back to Northern Thailand and see these sites for yourself ! <p> Hi Guys . I finally made my Visa Run to Vientiane . It seems the Cash Cow for the Tuk-Tuks , mini vans and buses is alive and well . We should start a biz going direct from Chiang Mai to Vientiane , as one of their " International Buses " took me from Vientiane Bus Station , all the way to Udon Thani , waited for us at both borders before moving on to Udon Thani . Meaning , it can be done . I was just looking at how beautiful this place is that you went . My girlfriend will be arriving in Chiang Mai soon . I wanted to take her Read more + <p> Hello , we actually took the trip with a couple we know in Chiang Mai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to rent a car I am sure it is pretty straight forward . The route is twisty at some points , but relatively easy to navigate . There are plenty of signs and the roads are very easy to follow . Do be sure to get gas while in Chiang Rai before going up to Mae Salong . We hope you have a great trip . Let us know how it goes ! <p> I love this part of the world , for our honeymoon my husband and I did the loops Backroads on a dirt bike , it was amazing ! We live in Kunming Yunnan so we head out thus way fairly often now that we 've experienced the beauty were completely addicted ! <p> Wow ! That sounds amazing . It is definitely something that we have talked about doing before . We are definitely going to talk to a couple of our friends to see if they would be up for a dirt bike trip . Thanks ! <p> We road-tripped it in a car ( havent been in one of those in a while ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio and talk ( not yell ! ) during the long ride . We booked the bungalow few days in advance and paid in cash once we got there . <p> Chris and Angela.thank you for website about what is like living in Thailand . My husband and I are not Thai but my husband speaks Thai fluently because he was a immigrant living in banvinai refugee camp for over 10 years . We have returned to Thailand yearly and absolutely love the country and people . We plan to officially move to Thailand in 5 years from now at the very latest . However , we will see you in June of 2015 . <p> Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to comment . You and your husband sound like you have an exciting adventure ahead of yourselves . Keep us posted and let us know when you are in town ! Best of luck : ) <p> As with everywhere else you have shown us , it looks beautiful and is worthy of at least a short stay there . Thanks for taking us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in " must see " itineraries . <p> It was GORGEOUS . And the Chinese temple in the distance was the icing on the cake ! Mae Salong is a perfect place to visit if you want relax and get away from the normal hustle and bustle , and you 're right , its not a well known destination . 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574725 @8574725/ <h> Foreign ATM Fee Solution Banking Abroad <p> There were a million things to consider before we moved to Thailand , and one that was foremost in our minds was how we were going to cost effectively access our money with the hope of avoiding the dreaded foreign ATM fee . Here is our best recommendation for coming out on top against the greedy banksters ! <h> What is a Foreign ATM Fee ? <p> Simply put , a foreign ATM fee is a charge that banks slam you with for using an ATM outside of their home country . <p> We had heard horror stories about the outrageous fees imposed by US based banks on foreign ATM withdrawals . This is actually slapped on top of the fee charged by each individual ATM , which happens to be 150 baht ( $5 USD ) a pop in Thailand . We found that most US banks charge an average 3% foreign ATM fee on each withdrawal . <p> For example , if we were to withdrawal $500 to pay our rent , we would be slammed with a $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a whopping $20 in fees just to access our own money . And because we rarely are able to pay with a credit card ( Thailand is a predominantly cash based economy ) we need to make a second withdrawal of $700 to cover our various living expenses . That is $46 a month a minimum of $552 a year in fees if we used a bank that did n't  have our best interests in mind ! <p> If you 're truly on a budget , $554 in yearly fees is n't something that you can just simply shrug your shoulders at . Luckily , we found a way to avoid this headache completely . <p> After doing a few hours of research , we came across the Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account . As far as we could gather they were ( and still are ) the only bank that would not impose a foreign ATM fee. - And get thisthey actually reimburse you for every withdrawal fee levied by ATMs on an unlimited amount withdrawals . During our first month here , when we frequented the ATM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , we were absolutely slammed with fees . We made sure to use our Charles Schwab ATM/Debit card for every transaction and at the end of the month noticed we had been reimbursed for each withdrawal for a total of $35.71 back in our pockets . We could n't believe it . We surely expected that we would be stuck eating the bill for at least one or two of the transactions , but we were quickly proven wrong . <p> Extracted from my Charles Schwab statement from 03/2013 <h> Things to Consider When Choosing a Bank For Your Needs Abroad : <p> Monthly service fees <p> Minimum account balance <p> Overdraft protection fees <p> Interest earnings <p> Foreign ATM Fee reimbursement <p> Options for depositing money <p> Quality of customer service <p> Charles Schwab Bank has easily checked these boxes for us so far . Remember , this is not just for the people who would like to live abroad on a permanent basis , but also for the backpacker , weekend traveler , or the couple that takes the vacation abroad once a year . <p> NOTE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Schwab Brokerage Account . No worries though , as you are not ever required to actually use it . Our account has remained dormant since we opened the account about a year ago . <h> Common Sense Money Tips While Traveling Abroad : <p> Withdraw your limit each time you visit the ATM , especially if you do n't  know when you might have access to an ATM again <p> Have a backup bank account with a separate ATM card in the case that your primary account card is lost or stolen <p> Have a backup credit card that does not charge foreign transaction fees e.g. The Capital One Venture Card <p> If you have a large amount of money that you do n't  intend to use , keep what you wont be using in a high yield checking/savings account e.g. The Capital One High Yield Checking Account <p> Keep up with the current daily exchange rate <p> Monitor all of your accounts for any signs of fraud or identity theft <p> Always notify your banks and/or credit card companies of the dates and location(s) of your upcoming travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for an unknown period of time ! <p> Please pass this on . As discussed here , you could really be saving someone you know a ton of money and helping them to avoid a major headache ! Know of any other money-saving tips for others traveling abroad ? Please share you knowledge in the comment section below ! <p> NOTE : We are in no way compensated for this post , nor are we in an agreement with Charles Schwab Bank or Capital One Bank . We are satisfied customers that would like to spread the word to anyone who is looking to travel overseas and is concerned about accessing their money intelligently and cheaply . <p> Hi Chris , I am a US citizen living in Republic of Panama . I currently pay a fortune in ATM fees here and I am very interested in the Schwab account , but is this for anywhere in the world or just Thailand ? I see mostly people from Thailand are posting on here , just wondering if it would be good for me also . <p> So I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rep told me that it was only available for domestic customers and if I am gone for over 6 months , I become an international customer and this particular account is not available for international customers .

So I am wondering , Read more + <p> We maintain an address in the US and always let Schwab know that we are traveling on and off in Thailand ( with no disclosed end date ) . We went back to the US after 14 months , visited a physical branch to make some changes to our accounts , and used our cards for purchases during that time . We have never had any issues . We also always carry a higher balance , so maybe they look past our lengthy time abroad . We can tell you that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh and we initially set up our Read more + <p> Phew .. We have just arrived in Thailand within the past week and already been to the ATM a few times . We are trying to figure out the right balance . We do have the Charles Schwab , so we too thought we would eat the local bank fee .

It will be nice when we can figure out how much Read more + <p> Yup ! The ATM fee is charged to your account that day , but at the end of the month CS refunds you the sum of the monthly fees .

To cut back on monthly fees , the best we can recommend is to take out the max amount each time at the ATM 20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATM fee per transaction . Of course , put the bulk of your withdraws somewhere safe ! There used to be a Thai ATM ( AEON ) that did not charge fees , but that Read more + <p> Thanks a lot for your insights Chris ! Were moving to Indonesia but unfortunately were unable to open bank accounts at Capital one or Charles Schwab as were EU residents . Which bank accounts would you then advice ? Thanks a lot , very appreciated . Alain <p> Great question ! Any bank that is part of they Global ATM Network will waive certain foreign transition fees . According to Nomadic Matt , if you are from England , Wales , Spain , Portugal , Gibraltar , use Barclays . If you are from Germany , Poland , Czech Republic , Spain , Portugal and Italy , use Deutsche Bank . Just make sure to read up on the banks policies for sure . We hope this sets you in the right direction . <p> Great analysis . For those from the UK , I do n't think there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a UK Capital One Mastercard which converts at the MC rate , without adding a 3% charge , so you can buy at close to spot rate . For ATM withdrawals , I found that a UK FairFX debit Mastercard only charges 1.4% for foreign ATM withdrawals ( rather than 3% ) + -1 . So if you withdraw more than about -65 , it is cheaper than the 3% normal rate , and the higher the amount , the lower the overall % as the -1 is Read more + <p> I cant remember all of the details , but our bank , USAA has a similar program . ATM fees both here in the US and abroad are reimbursed . I think there may be a monthly limit , but it saves us a ton . No foreign transaction fees on their card either . <p> Really ? I heard they used to reimburse foreign atm fees but we did n't  realize that they still did . I also have a USAA account so I am definitely going to have to check into it . Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be awesome to have a backup plan ready . <p> Love the site guys you have a lot of great info here ! We currently live in NC my wife is Thai and we hope to relocate there for our retirement years .. currently were living cheap investing/saving to make that happen sooner rather than later ! For now we enjoy our yearly vacation trips to sight see/visit family . Getting around ATM/international fees will be big help . Ill probably be opening a Schwab account soon .

How do you like China ? <p> Hey guys ! Great post . We lived in Thailand for nearly a month before we decided to move to China and ATM fees were killing us , seriously . Next time we will follow your advice ! Hows been Thailand treating you lately ? <p> Yeah I know , those things are very hard to find . I 've heard good and bad things about those though . There 's one in the Siam TV Electronics plaza in the upstairs section . But some peops have said they 've made a transaction and the cash has n't  come out but the account is still credited . Then it took months for them to appeal to get the money back . <p> Oh wow ! Yea , I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big C in Hang Dong . They also have a ATM locator on their website , but sadly their lack of local ATM fee does not get rid of the foreign ATM fee ones home bank may impose . Crazy to think that you are charged just for swiping your card in another countryI mean what is so costly about that to the bank ? Especially in this age of increased digital technology <p> Hey guys , unfortunately I think you need a US social security number in order to open a checking account according to their website . I do see that they operate in the UK , but it looks like they may only allow its citizens to open brokerage accounts . Maybe their is a similar UK bank that operates in the same way that Charles Schwab does when it comes to foreign ATM fees .

@@59574726 @8574726/ <h> Charles Schwabs Foreign ATM Fee Refund <p> One of the most common piece of advice we give to fellow American slow travelers and expats is to sign up for a Charles Schwab Investor Checking Account before coming to Thailand . The Charles Schwab foreign ATM fee refund we got back this past year even surprised us ! <p> One of the downsides of traveling or living overseas is the constant bombardment of foreign related fees . Banks , credit card companies , foreign ATMs , and money exchanges all want their cut for granting us the privilege of accessing our own money in a different currency . <p> Its a ridiculous business practice and hard to avoid . Unless , of course , you have an account with a company like Charles Schwab . <p> The other day we were doing a little financial account maintenance . We pulled up our Charles Schwab account and totaled the monthly refunds we had credited back to our account over the last year . These refunds cover international ATM fees and the 3% foreign transaction fee , and boy do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travel <p> The only way we have access to our cash is by withdrawing it from Thailands ATMs . Unfortunately , these ATMs charge a 200 baht fee per withdrawal ( 5.50 USD ) , which really add up over time . When we first got to Thailand , there were AEON ATMs that did n't  charge this fee . Unfortunately , as of early 2014 , this company no longer offers this service for free . <p> Assuming that most people go to the ATM once or twice a week , this racks up anywhere from $20 to $48 in ATM fees over the course of a month . Although this can be minimized by maxing out your withdrawal , even we admit to regularly doing small withdrawals of 5,000 or 10,000 baht ( 165 or 330 USD ) . <p> So for a typical 5,000 baht withdrawal , 200 baht is charged as the ATM withdrawal fee plus another 150 baht charged as the foreign transaction fee . Thats 350 baht or 10 USD just to get access to $165 . The frustration ! <p> The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year using another account , which is almost 5% of our money , is complete nonsense . In fact , the best word to describe what is going on is theft . Who agrees ? <p> We can not stress the importance of signing up for the Charles Schwab Investor Checking Account before doing any long-term travel abroad . So before you do , here are a few things to remember : <p> This account is a checking account that issues one debit card for security reasons . Hold onto that card with your life . <p> Signing up online may be easier than going into a bank or setting up an account over the phone . We did with no problem . <p> Do not mention that you are living or will be moving overseas . Just say you are traveling . Otherwise , they may not issue you the card . <p> Charles Schwabs physical branches do not handle cash . Therefore , you will need another bank account from which you can transfer your funds in and out . <p> Americans will benefit from knowing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one of many . <p> I withdrew cash with my Schwab card from an ATM at BKK , which warned me of the 200baht , but in this ATM transaction , the 200 was added to the withdrawal amount . there was no fee charged , &amp; no way for Schwab to refund . <p> Hey Chris &amp; Angela !

However , if you do n't  have a source of Thai income and are relying on your savings or pension in dollars or Euros , you will still have to pay a fee to transfer your funds from your bank account back home into you Thai account . To avoid any fees we suggest the Charles Schwab account , or alternatively , having a job in Thailand and depositing you earned Thai baht into an account for later use . <p> That is awesome , thanks a lot for the tip , I 'm currently here in BKK so when i get back to USA soon I 'll definitely move banks from my hometown one to this Shwab one .

Most tourists opt for the larger- Damnoen Saduak Floating Market , but if you want to avoid the crowds , then the Taling Chan Floating Market is probably one of your better bets . <p> Reaching the end of the walking street portion of Taling Chan Floating Market <p> The Taling Chan Floating Market is open on weekends from approximately 8:00 am to 5:00 pm and can be reached by several different ways , including : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station 10 to 12 km ) <p> Public Bus 79 from CentralWorld <p> Water taxi <p> There are even a few , slightly more expensive organized tours that leave from River City Shopping Complex and slowly tour along the unique back waterways of the Chao Phraya River before reaching the floating market . <p> Hm , this floating market is easy in that its close to the city and gives you a feel for a floating market . The other two ( Amphawa and Damnoen Saduak ) are far , far away . 60+ km drive combined with Bangkok traffic is a minimum 1.5 hrs one way and its more of a day trip . Its easy enough to navigate this one your own but if you want insight about the food and what you are looking at and some encouragement to sample the snacks a guide is a good idea .

@@59574729 @8574729/ <h> Chiang Mai Budget Breakdown <p> Considering that we will have lived in Northern Thailand for 100 days tomorrow , we thought we would share the details of our Chiang Mai budget with those who want a similar life abroad . We live comfortably , but in no way has it been smooth sailing the entire time . We have gone from making $15,000 per month in the United States to $1,500 per month ( or 45,000a++ ) in Thailand . As you can imagine , the ninety percent drop in income has been quite the adjustment , but we feel that our quality of life is better and we are happier because of it . Escaping your nine-to-five tends to have that effect ! Remember this budget is for two adults , so if you are single count on spending considerably less while achieving comparable results . Let 's get down to business ! <h> Monthly Chiang Mai Budget Breakdown <h> Accommodations <p> Our Chiang Mai budget allows us to live less than 1 km from the Old City- in a newly built two bedroom , three full bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) per month . Our master bedroom and guest bedroom both have air conditioners and on-suite bathrooms with hot showers . We opted to use a fan in our downstairs living room . We have a Western style kitchen with a dual convection oven/microwave . We also have one induction burner . We pay for government rate electricity ( 5 baht per unit ) , and our household water is taken care of by our landlord . We have a reverse osmosis water filtration machine ( 1 baht per 1.5 L ) and laundry facility ( 30 baht per load ) conveniently located a short walk down our quiet side street . <p> Angela making dinner with fresh local ingredients from our village market . <h> Food <p> Make no mistake , we are big foodies . Sometimes we say our main reason for escaping to Thailand is just because of the food ! Angela and I are really into all the different Thai flavors . We go out for dinner pretty much every evening . We typically enjoy one of the several different 30 baht ( about $1 USD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the week . <p> Chiang Mai Gate is home to some delicious beef and chicken biryani <p> The rest of the time we really love discovering great little hidden restaurants throughout the rest of Chiang Mai and spend anywhere from 150 to 600 baht per meal ( $5 to $20 USD ) , including a couple of beers . I was never a regular burger eater back home , but have found myself trying a new one about once a week for about 120 baht ( $4 USD ) . You would be surprised what you can find here living on a modest monthly Chiang Mai budget ! <p> One of many delicious $1.00 meals you can get on a Chiang Mai budget <h> Adult Beverages <p> We admit it , and we are n't  ashamed in the least bit about it , but we like to have a few beers or cocktails a couple of times a week . Could we live cheaper if we did n't  ? Absolutely , but we do n't  see the fun in that . Usually after one of our $1 feasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby bars . Loco Elvis is a Tex-Mex place just north of Thapae Gate on the inside of the moat , and is where you can usually find us . Yes , its a little touristy , and no , the drink prices are n't  the most competitive , but we still enjoy the lively atmosphere . Plus , our good friend that we met on our honeymoon works there , and she spends a little time teaching us Thai- every time we stop by . Its like getting beer and Thai lessons for 300 baht ( $10 ) an hour which is very compatible with our monthly Chiang Mai budget . Ca n't beat that ! <p> Angela and our good friend at Loco Elvis <h> Transport <p> We bought a brand new 2013 300cc Honda Forza ( probably the largest scooter in Thailand ) soon after we moved here . We fill up its 11.6 liter tank about twice a month for 350 baht ( $11.50 USD ) . Now that we live here , we wanted something that could easily carry our hauls from our local market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips . <p> Plus , I have some lower back issues and after renting a small 125cc motorbike I quickly realized I needed maximum surface area to distribute the weight of my big ass evenly . If you are over six feet tall and 200 plus pounds and have experienced a ride on a Honda Dream , then you know what I am talking about . More like a nightmare if you ask me . In addition to our motorbike , we spend a couple hundred baht ( $6 to $8 USD ) on tuk-tuks throughout the course of a month . <p> The Honda Dream A.K.A Your Asss Worst Nightmare <h> Groceries <p> We find most of the fresh food items that we need at our local markets , which are extremely affordable . Things like bread and yogurt can be bought at your nearest 7-Eleven or Tesco Express . For example , a packet of four yogurts costs about 50 baht ( $1.60 USD ) . <p> The local markets around Chiang Mai puts our grocery store back home to shame . <h> Household <p> Nothing too crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , cleaner , and detergent at our local 7-11 or Tesco Express as well . Rest assured there will be one of these small stores very close by . They 're everywhere ! If you need more specific items , there are larger Tesco and Big C superstores just on the outside of the old city . <p> Tesco stores have most anything you need and rival the big superstores stateside <h> Personal Care <p> Always Chiang Mai budget friendly are the various spa services that scatter across the city . I get a haircut , shampoo ( keeps the hair out of my motorbike helmet ) , and a head massage for 150 baht ( about $5 USD ) . Womens haircuts will run you anywhere from 350 to 1,000 baht . We spoil ourselves with a foot massage a few times a month , and both a one hour Thai massage or one hour foot massage will run you about 150 to 180 baht ( $5 or $6 USD ) . <p> Be careful . Sometimes the water they wash your feet in is ice cold ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai budget ? Just about anything . From whitewater rafting to go-kart racing to ziplining , Chiang Mai is perfect for the outdoorsy type . There is also the Major Cineplex at the Central Plaza Mall , which costs 150 baht ( only $5 ) per ticket on Wednesdays and is nicer than ninety percent of movie theaters we 've been to . They offer a decent selection of movies with English tracks , but just make sure you buy your tickets for the new releases fast as they sell out early in the day , especially during weekends . If you get there too early , you can always grab some affordable ( 5 baht per piece ) , but tasty sushi in the food court . We love it . <h> Savings <p> As you can see from our $1,500 a month Chiang Mai budget we have allowed ourselves to save about $300 a month ( $3,600 per year ) for an annual month-long trip back to the United States to visit family , or as a safeguard in the case that an emergency comes up . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lifestyle . <p> Not included in our Chiang Mai budget is the recent development of Angela securing a teaching position not far away from our neighborhood . Her salary will provide us with an additional $900 a month , which is an average teachers salary in Chiang Mai . She will work nine months out of the year , and we hope to save her entire salary for our future travels and to further cushion our nest egg . <p> What kind of budget do you sustain while traveling or living as an expat ? We would love to hear how others are living frugally abroad ! <p> Hi . I concieve this is by far the best budget breakdown for CM . Much obliged . Would you mind clarifying one thing ? I might be wrong but the groceries + food figures seem a bit low . Groceries + food is 143 per day per person for you . You say 30 per dinner per day . That leaves just 113 for lunch and you stated that the rest of the time you eat for more , minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures are even more off .

We rarely ate breakfast if so , it was eggs and toast , yogurt , or a cup of instant coffee that we bought at a convenience store , which is less than 30 baht per meal . By that point , Angela had also started teaching and her school provided her with free lunch five days per week , although from time to time she bought snacks that were $0.25 or $0.50 . To make homecooked meals , we shopped almost exclusively at Thai markets ( chicken , veggies , eggs , rice and noodles ) . We would n't have been able to spend Read more + <p> Hi Angela and Chris , would you have a recommendation for a guide for us who has experience in where and how expats live in CM ?

As for the heat and AC , its hard to say how much will you spend . There are a few things to keep in mind : 1 . Do you like cool air ( 75 degrees or more ) or frigid air ( 70 degrees and below ) ? 2 . Will your landlord charge you the government rate of 5 baht per unit or will it be more ? 3 . How does your own body acclimate to heat ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai is a very nice city and I hope to visit again soon . Oh , and nice bike !

Currently sitting in BK , heading to Chaing Mai in a few days to check out the area as would like to move there and start teaching soon if possible . Can relate to the lower back issues as well ! One of the reasons i left my job in the UK to travel was to embrace a more back friendly lifestyle , although thai roads are a little bumpy lol . What is the availability of tefl jobs up there like as i know its an increasingly popular area to work in .. ? Cheers <p> Haha , long bus rides especially are n't  good for the back ! Chiang Mai is a popular expat location , so you 'll have to be on your A game when applying for TEFL jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to take over a position that another teacher has left . Do n't  forget to look into language schools that are n't  on a yearly schedule but have new students monthly , and its also popular to teach vacationing Chinese students here . Good luck ! <p> Chris , I am a police Officer In Canada ready to retire . I am thinking we may like to teach English in Chaing Mai but we do not have Bachelors Degrees With the TESL course , could I teach there ? Thoughts ? <p> This is a touchy subject . Legally you can not teach without a Bachelors degree or higher . Its just Thailands law . However , you 'd have to find a school or hiring agency that is willing to look the other way or accept an online " life " degree ( usually costs a few hundred dollars ) . It has been done ! We 've always recommend earning a TEFL before teaching in Thailand because its a qualifier on your resume and it definitely prepares you for teaching English as a second language . Good luck ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are coming over for a visit to Chaing Mai in 2 weeks . Just wondering about the possibilities of a permanent move some day . We are 50 . What type of work can you do there ? Can Canadians/Americans seek employment there ? Many more questions but will hold it to that . I have checked out the rents ; very nice ! Ken <p> You are eligible for a retirement is at 50+ and that will get you a one year visa , renewable every year as long as you meet the basic requirements outlined on a Thai Embassy website . Although the most popular way to make money is to teach , the general rules is that foreigners ( i.e. , Americans and Canadians ) can not be hired for a job that a Thai citizen can do . So , you ca n't be a bartender , or a lawyer or a doctor or retail clerk but you can be a teacher because you are a native speaker , which Thais are n't  .

There are hundreds of hotels and guesthouses to stay at in Chiang Mai while you look for a permanent place to live . However , we can recommend The Bliss . It is very clean , offer month to month contracts ( prices drop if you book longer stays ) , and its in a posh area just northwest of the Old City . The apartment has a kitchen , balcony , and Western bathroom . If we remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baht ( $600 ) a month .

We live a simple lifestyle , eat simple , dnt drink nor smoke . Just need an accomodation that is modern living , safe , convenient to market or shopping mall . <p> Everyones lifestyle and spending habits are different , but even at $1000 a month for two people is quite tight . The best way you can afford to do this is find a place a little outside the main city but near a Thai market or shopping area so you can get things you need . Strive for $150-300 a month accommodation . Also , you will probably spend twice your budget on your first month as you settle down getting a cell phone , renting a bike , buying a few things like kitchen stuff , cleaning supplies , toiletries , etc .

You do n't  necessarily have to have past experience teaching to be hired . As long as you have a bachelors degree , you can get a business visa and work permit along with the teaching gig .

Compared to the healthy Mediterranean diet , Thai food is over-salted , ( including MSG ) , over-sugared , over-spiced and often over-fatty . Eat too much of it and you will get fat and even very sick . Thai food is just an obsession for many foodies , so it would never grab me as i only eat to live , not live to eat . <p> Hmm Thai street food is one thing , but I definitely would not lump in all Thai food as being unhealthy . You can eat healthy anywhere , and with all of the fresh ingredients in Thailand you would be silly not to take advantage . If you speak a little bit if the language you can easily have you food prepared any way that you like i.e. Less salt , no MSG , etc . We love Thailand and absolutely love Thai food .

We plan to relocate to Thailand within the next 4 to 5 months . You mentioned Angela got a job teaching in Chiang Mai . If its ESL related teaching , did the job required a CELTA/TEFL certification ? Would you recommend CELTA certification over the TEFL certification , or does it really matter in getting a ESL teaching job in Thailand ? Thank you . <p> The three requirements for teaching in Thailand are : Posses a Non-Immigrant B Visa , a bachelors degree or higher ( does not have to be a degree in teaching or English ) , and a ( 120 hr ) TEFL certificate . A CELTA is not required for a job , although I know someone who has it and says it is helpful if you plan to teach adults .

Though I spend a fair bit more on equipment ( and less on " adult beverages " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long distance travel , so if you can take an apt and stop in 1 place for a while , expenses are reasonable .

Yes , the adult beverage category is an ever changing one , but we are n't  afraid of spending a little money on relaxing with a couple beers or cocktails .

Good luck and take care ! <p> Very interesting budget . I live much further south and prices are different . Having visited Chiang Mai I found it so much cheaper then Phuket , especially for food . One thing I notice is missing from your declared budget is Health Insurance . As someone who is currently paying back a 1.2 m Bht emergency health care cost please , please , make sure that you are adequately insured . <p> Geraint , you make an excellent point to invest in health insurance if living abroad . We have casually looked into it , but when we finally do purchase health insurance , we will be sure to share our research and our final decisions with our followers . As with many other things in Thailand , its very affordable ! At least we have medical coverage if we get into a motorcycle accident , which we purchased in addition to the regular policy offered through our Honda Forza .

Another major area that quickly eats up a budget are the touristy day trips or weekend adventures , which youve also said you are n't  interested in .

We do like Thai food a lot , but a few times a week we do hit some of the nicer sit down western restaurants . If you look hard enough there are some really reasonable prices to be had .

She has been a huge help showing us around , connecting us with our land lady , and finding cool things for us to do with our friends while they are in town . Having Thai friends has been wonderful . They are so accommodating and very nice to be around . <p> Yes , we have a one year lease , but there are many places that offer month to month agreements . Could be a little bit difficult to find a house to rent for less than 6 months , but condos and apartments offering shorter leases are everywhere . You could look to pay on average around $300 to $400 a month for a comfortable place . Be prepared to pay a security deposit too . <p> Yes , housing can be had for a even lower than what we pay . We love our location though . We have a couple good friends that live 10-15 mins out of the city and they pay half of what we pay for a 3 bedroom house ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following your blog and look forward to retiring in Chiang Mai in just over a year . Maybe we will meet up and well buy you a beer or two . Vince and Lin <p> Great post ! When we get over there we are looking to live cheaply as well . We are prepared for our income to drop by knowing that we are going to be living how we want to live ( not dealing with bosses that expect way to much from us ) . One of the reasons we choose Thailand is because of the food as well . : ) After all , a happy tummy equals a happy mind ! <p> I could never live in a place with bad food ! We are simply addicted to the food here in Thailand . I am glad you enjoyed the post . It always boosted our confidence to see how others were living in Chiang Mai while we were making the decision to move . Hope this did the same for you .

@@59574731 @8574731/ <h> Ban Jed Yod : Our First Apartment in Chiang Mai <p> When it was time to look for a place to rent in Chiang Mai , we were overwhelmed with the number of options available for short-term living . After looking through online listings , brochures , and magazines , we finally zeroed in our very first apartment in Chiang Mai : Ban Jed Yod . It is a modern serviced apartment just outside of Chiang Mai 's Old City and ended up being an excellent first choice while we settle into our new life in Chiang Mai . <p> In the time it used to take to complete our typical morning commute , we found an online review for the Ban Jed Yod serviced apartment ( short-term furnished apartment that includes amenities for daily use ) , contacted the leasing office for their availability , scheduled a visit , and signed a three-month lease . Unbelievable . Thanks to Magic Travel Blogs very thorough and positive review , we were able to find a new apartment much quicker than we had initially expected . <p> Located about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town , the Ban Jed Yod serviced apartments sounded appealing to us for the following reasons : <p> Within our $300-$500 per month budget <p> Able to accommodate month-to-month leases <p> Fully furnished <p> Equipped with several very nice amenities , including washer and dryer machines , a small restaurant and coffee bar , and free on site drinking water <p> Conveniently located within a short driving distance of Chiang Mai University and some of the nicer shopping areas the city has to offer <p> - <p> We fell in love with the modern decor , the view of Doi Suthep , the beautiful pool , and the outdoor lounge area . We were impressed with the particular unit we viewed , and being that it was the only deluxe unit available , we signed a three-month lease for 10,000 baht per month , or $330 . <p> Pool on the 6th Floor <h> Pros of Ban Jed Yod <p> Furnishings included a California King bed with sheets and pillows , computer desk and plush chair , dining table and chairs , vanity , TV , shoe storage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to be fair , here are some of the things we found to be under par . However , most of these things were fixable one way or another or had a work around . <h> Cons of Ban Jed Yod <p> The mattress was Thai firm no joke ! <p> We had an ant problem <p> Nighttime noise prevented us from opening the windows during the evening hours <p> Few restaurants within reasonable walking distance <p> Electricity is charged at 7 baht per unit , not the government rate of 5 baht per unit <p> Not pet friendly ( as we later found out ) <p> Ban Jed Yod was a great place for us to begin our lives in Chiang Mai . With it 's great amenities , modern look , and excellent price tag , we were happy , even if we could n't keep our windows open at night or had to buy a can of bug spray . <p> Ban Jed Yod is located off Yu Yen Road Soi 2 in Chang Phuak , just northwest of the Old City , and is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( two twin beds or one king bed ) for 10,000 baht per month or one bedroom apartments for 15,000 baht per month . A two month 's security deposit is required after a signed lease ( in English ) . <p> Hi ! Do you have recommendations for shorter term leases ? Is it easy to find them on a month-to-month basis ? I am a traveler who is not really in a traveling mindset right now but does n't  want to go home . <p> If you want something shorter than three months ( such as a month or a few weeks ) , many hotels in Thailand are willing to offer a severely discounted monthly rate . The weekly rates are n't  bad , either . Try that first . <p> Not really . The roads are very narrow and hugged by shops , so there 's nowhere to go in case you need to dodge a car or motorbike . On the flip side , everyone is driving very slow so motorized vehicles should n't be trying to fly by you anyways . <p> We are considering this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left your valuable there while you were out of the country for 2 weeks ? Do you happen to know what a private internet line would be ? About how far walk to Central or Salad Concept if you happen to know ? Thanks ! <p> We definitely felt safe at Ban Jed Yod . Its a small , private building with key access to the front door , so your valuables should be safe if you take a trip out of the country . A private internet line costs between $20-30 a month with a small set up fee . We suggest speaking with the front desk for approval and to arranging for installation . Salad Concept is a 25 minute walk right down the highway . The Jed Yod area has really built up a lot since we 've moved out . Make sure to check out the nearby restaurants and shops ! <p> Just returned from the front desk . They said there was no any private internet line . When I said that internet was very slow they replied that they were going to reset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The connection was fine , but we remember having to log in a lot to re-establish the connection . The main office provides a username and password . A work around would be to ask to put in a private line . <p> Great Info , You were lucky to find a great apartment so quickly . Chiang Mai has many hidden Gems , that is for sure . If anyone is looking for longer term accommodation may I recommend Perfect Homes . http : **27;502;TOOLONG Homes They really looked after us when we arrived . <p> How exciting for you both ! And while there is always some compromise , it sure seems like the cons are manageable to deal with . That must be thrilling to have found something so quickly and easily . I look forward to your next post ! <p> Looks like you found a great place ! Those cons are n't  too bad . I 've read many travel and expat articles that apartments charge extra for electricity , so its not just your apartment . Love having your site to gather information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , the pros outweighed the cons . A little bug spray and ant chalk go a long way , and as long as you make it a habit of using the AC sparingly , its not too expensive . Thanks for following us and were glad to help you with your own move to Thailand . <p> Wow ! How come this is the first time Ive seen this review ? I did n't  realize how beautiful your first apartment was until now . The only issue I see is that its far out from the old city , other than that , it looks great ! <p> Ban Jed Yod is a great starter " home " , only they do n't  like cats so we had to leave : ( It was a little too far for our liking because we found ourselves going into the Old City almost every day . If our lifestyle was a little different and we stayed home more , it probably would n't have been too bad . We do n't  think we would have stayed their if we owned a bicycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our more recent post about having to move out of Ban Jed Yod because we brought our cat with us , we did enjoy our two week stay there . I 'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted to do a one or two month stay in Thailand . It certainly helped us with the transition of first arriving in Thailand with next to nothing to be able to purchase some necessities we needed for our more permanent home . Thanks again ! <p> I believe our 2 week electric bill was around 1000 baht ( little over $30 ) . We ran our aircon , tv , and laptop throughout the day since it was the hot season when we arrived . We did n't  run the AC while we slept as the cross-breeze on the top floor sufficed . In our current home our electric bill for a month ( government rate ) runs us between 750 and 1200 baht per month . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 9 months ago 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574733 @8574733/ <h> Doi Suthep Temple in Chiang Mai <p> Our friends from the USA made the long trek to visit us in Chiang Mai .

With that has come a clear skyline and a view of Chiang Mais famous Doi Suthep mountain on the west side of the city . <p> View of Doi Suthep from Suthep Rd <p> After squaring them away with a super sweet pink Honda Click motor scooter , we opted to test that bad boy out with the short , but very twisty ride up the picturesque Doi Suthep mountain . <p> Only a few vehicles were making the trek up the mountain as early evening approached , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day to pass to pursue the curvy climb . <p> As we guided our motorbikes around the bends and twists of the mountain road , we enjoyed the shade from the hugging trees and the gradually cooling air . About halfway up the mountainside we stopped at one of the overlook points to view the city from up high , a must see for any first time visitor . <p> View from Doi Suthep <p> Angela and her friend , Amanda , halfway up the Doi Suthep mountain on one of Chiang Mais overlooks . <h> Arriving at the Doi Suthep Temple <p> The four of us continued following the winding road until we reached the Doi Suthep Temple . It was quiet . Most shops had closed and covered up for the day , and many of the tourists were leaving as we were just beginning the climb of over 300 steps to the 630 year old temple occupying the top of Doi Suthep . <p> A dog local to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep naps at the bottom of the temple steps . <p> FUN FACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doi Suthep and not simply Wat Doi Suthep is because Phra That means that the temple contains a Buddha relic . In fact , any temple in the world with a Buddha relic can proudly have this in its title . <p> We stopped a few times on the way to the top to snap a few pictures . The greenery lining the stairs was speckled with large red flowers . The railings on either side of the steps were sculpted into the bodies of a snakelike dragons with raised green and yellow scales . <p> Angela on the steps of Wat Phra That Doi Suthep . <p> Although it was a long steep climb , it was well worth it once we reached the top . The temple grounds were stunning . The dark swirling sky over the gold temple domes made for a beautiful sight . With almost no one else at the temple , it felt remarkably peaceful and serene . This being our second trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep , we recommend visiting a bit later in the day to avoid the crowds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we admired the fine details that make this temple such an important place to Thai people living in Chiang Mai and the rest of Thailand .

We did n't  understand the meaning some of the individual pieces in the gardens , but they were eye-catching nonetheless . Each item added a subtle touch that allowed us to use our imaginations a bit during our visit . <p> One of the temple gardens <p> We left the temple as the wind started picking up and the darker clouds rolled in .

My first time in the country was spent along the southern coasts , and with the overly touristy atmosphere there you feel like you could be in any of the Southeast Asian beaches .

@@59574736 @8574736/ <h> When is the Best Time to Sell Your Stuff ? <p> Before moving abroad , we sold everything we owned through Craigslist , eBay , yard sales , consignment shops , electronic buyback websites , and even to family and friends . <p> But where to begin ? How did we prioritize our items into what , when , and how we sold them ? Here are nine steps detailing the best time to sell your stuff , starting from one year out until the last few days before your big move . <h> When Really is the Best Time to Sell Your Stuff ? <p> You can never start getting rid of your stuff too early , but you can start getting rid of your stuff too late ! - To keep your sanity and to truly maximize your profits , it is important to follow a general timeline to purge your home. - Below , we break down exactly what we sold , when we sold it , and through which method . <h> 1 . Sell Your Stuff You Are n't  Using : 6 Months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff is between one year and six months before your big move . Begin with a general purge of things that are tucked away in your basement , attic , or closets and that you have n't touched a year or more . Make sure items are in good to excellent condition . <p> We focused on our guestroom closet that contained things we werent using , including unopened boxes from our last move . We purged the closet , sold the stuff on Craigslist , and earned roughly $1000 . We also sold another $165 of knick-knacks at our communitys spring yard sale . Earning our initial $1165 was a huge motivator for us and paved our way to continue selling our stuff . <h> 2 . Sell Your Stuff You Rarely Use : 4 to 6 Months <p> Do you have luxury items or things you use but can live without ? Sell em . <p> We sold kitchen appliances , including our wine cooler , fancy juicer , mini fridge , and bread machine . We sold doubles of anything , such as a smaller TV , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold popular books , wall art , and video games that we werent using , either through Craigslist or online sales such as Amazon . In all honestly , it was n't too hard let these items go . <p> We also reluctantly sold our workout equipment just after Christmas , but it sold like hot cakes . Why ? Because the best time to sell your stuff is when everyone is making their New Year 's resolutions . <h> 3 . Sell Your Seasonal Items : 4 to 6 Months <p> Sell seasonal items , including clothing , holiday related items , and sports or yard equipment . The best time to sell your stuff is right before the time of year they are in high demand . <p> We sold about three dozen pieces of gently used brand named clothing in addition to accessories to consignment shops . We sold our summer clothes in the early spring and our winter clothes in the early fall . <p> We sold our Christmas decorations in early December . The best time to sell your stuff is when you can take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some money off of a four foot fake Christmas tree , lights , and ornaments by timing our sales just right . <h> 4 . Sell Your Furniture in Minor Rooms : 2 to 4 Months <p> The best time to sell your stuff in minor rooms is not too far in advance , but give enough time to move those heavy items . <p> We sold all of the furniture and decor items from our guest room , guest bathroom , dining room , home office , and our balcony . Furniture was our biggest money maker , and we sold all of it through Craigslist . We also made money off of lamps , throw pillows , and curtains . It started getting difficult to see our stuff go , but the cash rolling in encouraged us. <h> 6 . Sell Your Kitchen Stuff : - 2 to 4 Weeks <p> Assuming you cook often , the best time to sell your stuff from the kitchen is towards the last few weeks . <p> At this point we were simultaneously trying clear out our dry pantry and fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gadgets , mixing bowls , pots and pans , etc . We found that we our smaller kitchen items sold better together in sets . <h> 7 . Sell Your Vehicle : 2 to 4 Weeks <p> The best time to sell your stuff , such as your last vehicle , is right before your big move , but with enough time to weigh your offers . We sold our Honda Civic through a private sale a couple weeks before our one-way flight to Thailand . It worked out perfectly because we were gone on a round-the-USA trip visiting family during our final weeks in the US . <p> NOTE : We had two vehicles , a Ford Edge that we still made monthly payments on and a Honda Civic we owned . About two months before we moved , we sold our Ford Edge to CarMax to get rid of the monthly insurance payments , loan , and gas expenses . <h> 8 . Sell Your Master Bedroom Furniture : 1 Week <p> The best time to sell your stuff , such as the master bedroom furniture , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> We managed to keep the mattress and bed frame until the day we moved out , but still had to get rid of the curtains , comforter set , the master bath decor , and even the vacuum cleaner . <h> 9 . What Ca n't Be Sold , Donate During the Last Few Days <p> Donate to the local Goodwill , homeless shelter , library , animal shelter , or YMCA . Do n't forget about friends or family members who would appreciate some free clothes or other random stuff ! <p> During the last week in our apartment , we donated everything we could n't sell . We gave pantry items and cleaning products to family and donated clothes and other household items to Goodwill . We donated towels and unused flea medicine to the local animal shelter and books and magazines to the local library . If it was in good condition we gave it away ; otherwise , we threw it away . <h> The End Result $27,000 in Cash <p> Figuring out when the best time to sell your stuff can really pay off ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enormous project by breaking it into smaller , more manageable parts , month by month . It took a lot of hard work and many sacrificed evenings and weekends . Even when times got rough , we used the momentum we gained from big sales and the excitement of moving overseas to push us through those last few weeks when our sales dwindled and we were tired of giving up our evenings . In the end , we got rid of everything and were rewarded with a few light suitcases each and a well cushioned savings account . <p> Have you tried to purge your apartment or house and did n't  know where to start ? Was there anything that was particularly difficult to sell ? Do you think you could make the time and energy to sell your stuff ? When do you think the best time to sell your stuff is ? <p> Check out our recently featured post on Man Vs Debt- for a more inspiration ! <p> We each had a small box that we gave to my ( Angelas ) parents . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things from our childhood . We definitely recommend having a family member ( parents , siblings ) or a good friend hold onto things that are irreplaceable . But only one small box each , the same ones 8.5 ? x11 ? printing paper gets delivered in , no more ! <p> Your suggestions of selling your stuff can also apply if you do n't  plan to go anywhere . I have tried but I can see that I am hoarder . Not a good thing . Making a deadline for yourself even if you are not moving is a great idea to get rid of stuff . <p> Indeed they can ! We started this endeavor because we just wanted to get rid of the junk we had accumulated in our walk-in guest closet . As soon as we made the decision to move to Thailand , it was easy to make the transition and continue selling everything else . <p> Were not planning a move any time soon but I would love to purge ! No matter how hard we try not too , with 3 kids its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason this season seems like the perfect season to purge our home of everything we do n't  really need so I 'm posting on Craigs list and planning a yard sale .. I also regularly give gently used items to shelters and our local Goodwill . I like to know those things go to people who really need them . <p> We made frequent trips to Goodwill and Animal shelters for some of our pet items . There was a Goodwill located right next door to the community we lived in . We met a really nice guy working there from Nepal who had so wonderful advice for us regarding our trip to live halfway around the world . Great experience for us , and we know they items we donated went to help those less fortunate . Thank you for sharing , and I we are sure many people will be happy to receive your donations . Take care ! <p> We feel like we have so much more freedom to do the things we love . Carrying around such a large amount of stuff that you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage is a waste of energy and time . We hope these tips help you free up your life a littleand earn you a bit of extra cash in the meantime ! <p> Weve been through two downsizing moves in our hometown of Philadelphia , but being at another time in our lives , we were able to give our stuff away to friends and relatives and donate items . Now , we will be living in Hawaii ( while my husband is on sabbatical ) and then traveling in southeast Asia for a month . Well be gone from January through May . We have to figure out how to sublet our furnished Center City Philadelphia apartment . <p> It is a lot of work , but when you have something worth doing it is enough to motivate you to knock out the hard work .

Good luck with your apartment ! <p> That was just ( some of ) the stuff in our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand bags , 30ft rope , dip bar , etc ) kept at Chriss office . These weights sold so fast we did n't  have time to get sad . Wish we had it here now , too ! <p> This is a great guide .

The thing that surprised me was how long it took to sell my car . I started trying to sell it more than a month before the trip and it did n't  sell for a month after we left .

Um , who does n't  like gut-busting Sunday brunches , specialty spa treatments , and skillfully crafted cocktails ? That 's exactly what we got at The Sukosol , an elegant four-star hotel that 's perfect for anyones first time in Bangkok . Its a quick ride from the Suvarnabhumi International Airport via the Airport Rail Link and just steps from the BTS Skytrain , two of the most convenient ways to get around Bangkoks massive urban sprawl . <p> If you had n't  already guessed , The Sukosol is far more than a just place to sleep after a long day of exploring the city . In fact , four nights at the The Sukosol was practically a vacation in itself because everything we needed was either a phone call or a push of an elevator button away . <p> Whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the patio garden area , or enjoying their signature Afternoon Tea in their stunningly sophisticated speakeasy-styled Sapphire Bar , The Sukosol made it easy ( maybe a little too easy ) to kick back and fully relax during our time there . <h> Ayuthaya Deluxe Room <p> After a quick check-in and refreshing welcome drinks of butterfly pea blossom lemonade , we were whisked up to our room on the 18th floor with , undoubtedly , views of the city skyline . Our room was larger than what we have come to expect in Bangkok , seeing as though space is such a prime commodity in this buzzing city . But there it was , a huge plush king size bed with our names on it , a chaise for lounging , a large desk area ( two in fact ) , and plenty of space for our luggage . <p> Our bathroom had a fully enclosed glass stand-up rain shower ( yes ! ) with awesome pressure and temperature control . Much to our delight there was a bathtub ( double yes ! ) , which we later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city heavily on foot . <h> Dining at The Sukosol <p> What blew us away most at The Sukosol was the quality and variety of dining options available at their Sapphire Bar and their Patummat and Lin-Fa restaurants . We were able to try both restaurants during our stay and really appreciated the elegant atmosphere and attentive service . <p> The Sapphire Bar was absolutely stunning . The drinks we ordered were treats all on their own , and included a finely crafted Lychee Mojito and a Manhattan . Thank you very much , Mr. Bartender . <p> Looking back on it , its hard to pick a favorite meal ! If we had to choose only one though , it would be the Patummats International Dinner Buffet . There was an incredible choice of food including chilled shellfish , made-to-order Italian pasta dishes , and sushi and meat-carving stations . <p> There were also generous selections of hot Thai , Japanese , and Chinese dishes as well as chilled dishes and salads . And believe us when we say we had our fill of freshly baked bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! And just to throw it out there , you do n't  have to be a guest of the hotels to indulge in this feast . <p> The dinner buffet runs from 6pm to 10:30pm daily and costs 1,300 baht person .

We now have an even greater appreciation for Thai masseuses ! The class costs 500 baht per person .

If you take the SA City line , which makes six stops along the way , it takes about 30 minutes and costs 45 baht . <p> As for the Phaya Thai BTS Station , being so close provided us with easy access to many other points of interest in the city .

@@59574738 @8574738/ <h> Thailand Expat Dream Kitchen <p> After getting the boot from our modern studio apartment , we found ourselves in our long-term residence much sooner than initially expected . With the help of our local friend , we found a brand spankin new townhouse about 1 km ( half a mile ) from the south side of the Old City . <h> Free Kitchen Included in Our Lease <p> In fact , it was so new that the kitchen was n't even built yet . To our surprise , our soon-to-be landlord told us that she would build the kitchen anyway we wanted it . Wha-wha-wha ! ? That 's awesome ! So we downloaded the Interior Design app and had fun designing our new kitchen one evening . Yeah , let me whip out my interior designer and architect skills <p> Ok , so Thai kitchens are much different from kitchens back home . It is common to see entire kitchens outside in Thailand , or at least designated to the outer part of the building . Its smart actually keep the cooking heat out of the cool house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( think fish sauce and curry paste ) . As for the components in a That kitchen , there are usually <p> Small counters designed with little or no prep space ( barely large enough for appliances ) <p> Small fridges . Like college dorm small . <p> Oh , and did I mention that the tap water is not potable ? An area designated for large drinking water jugs is a must . <p> When we first looked at our new townhouse , the original kitchen area was set up to be on the outside of the house , like a traditional Thai kitchen . It was walled and roofed , but was open to the elements . I could have gotten used to cooking outside , but I would have had a hard time talking to Chris or guests in the other room while making a meal . <h> Kitchen Design <p> Since we were given the freedom to design a kitchen , we opted to bring the kitchen entirely inside . Designing it was fun . We kept it pretty simple , and this is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly more western . And it was just our luck that we were getting a dual convection oven/microwave . Our landlord bought it without realizing it was only in English , so she could n't use it herself . And instead of a formal dining table , we preferred to sit at the counter to make space for a small seating area in the same room . <p> Another shot of the design from above <p> Construction started right away . It took all of four days to have furniture moved into the townhouse and for the entire kitchen to be done . <p> We still need to buy a few things . For one , we need dining chairs as well as something equivalent to a pantry . We also plan to make a little sitting area to watch TV . Slowly but surely we will buy furniture . But for now , its so refreshing to have ample counter space and a good sized fridge ! <p> We are a Thai Aussie couple and we have just built a bungalow in Maha Sarakham . Like you we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we had to enclose it . Now we have to install our inside kitchen . I need to decide on the work surface . I would like granit or marble . Is that practical ? Also would you recommend a gas or electric cooker ? <p> Our landlord made the decision about the countertop , which was tile with an infinitesimal amount of grout between it . And as for a cooker , which do you prefer ? We cook all the time and hands down prefer gas ranges . Good luck designing your new house ! <p> Pam , the owner chose to use tile . Even in our new house , we have tile counter-tops . Its rather nice and something we never would have thought to use in the west . Each tile measures half a meter square . <p> Hey guys , just came across your website and thought it was cool that you 're living in Chiang Mai . My wife and I were just there in October 19-30 for the first time and loved it so much , we bought a new build house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later part of next year .. Ted 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574741 @8574741/ <h> 9 Myths About Thailand That Worry Your Family <p> As your family and friends find out that you 're moving to Thailand , are they convinced you will be stranded in some undeveloped country with limited access to running water and electricity ? Do they keep mixing up Thailand and Taiwan ? Does it make you want to scream from the mountaintops that Thailand is awesome ? In case you 've heard similar silliness , we 've created a list to help ease your familys and friends worries . Its time we put some myths about Thailand to rest , because there is more to Thailand than what western media will have you know ! <h> 01 Thailand has an Underdeveloped Infrastructure <p> Does your family believe in the myths about Thailands poorly developed infrastructure ? There is no need to worry about freely moving throughout the country or getting out should an emergency arise . In fact , Thailand has over twenty airports , eight of which are international : <p> Suvarnabhumi International Airport ( BKK ) <p> Don Mueang International ( DMK ) <p> Chiang Mai International Airport ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hat Yai International Airport ( HDY ) <p> Phuket International Airport ( HKT ) <p> Samui International Airport ( USM ) <p> U-Tapao International Airport ( UTP ) <p> There are also trains , extensive bus routes , and modern highways throughout Thailand . The accessibility of this international travel hub should be the least of anyones worries . <h> 02 Thailand is Very Unsafe <p> Thailand is a safe country for expats and travelers , especially for women traveling solo . Thai people are welcoming , respectful , and generally non-violent towards foreigners . The biggest concerns are scams in touristy areas , such as getting charged much more than one should , and crimes of opportunity , like petty thefts . <p> Despite off-and-on and sometimes volatile political protests in certain areas of Bangkok , daily life is largely unaffected elsewhere in Thailand . Protests and demonstrations are easily avoidable with a little planning and forethought . <p> Road accidents are common in Thailand . Wear proper safety gear while on a motorbike , always be aware of your surroundings , and use common sense , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious incidents are easily preventable and occur when a person develops a false sense of security while living or traveling abroad . <h> 03 Youll Live in a Bamboo Hut with Dirt Floors <p> Do n't  believe the myths about Thailand having dodgy living accommodations . Thailand offers the same amenities of Western countries , and there are plenty of modern options available . Our first apartment came with a flat screen TV , a bathtub , a king sized bed , and plenty of storage areas , all for $330 USD a month . Our current house is set on a private lot , two bedrooms , two bathrooms , and a Western kitchen for $450 USD per month . <h> 04 Youll Be Eating Nothing But- Carry Out <p> Yes , there are stir fries and plenty of dishes with rice and noodles , but do n't  let myths about Thailands cuisine fool you into thinking its the same as the generic takeaway from that run of the mill Chinese delivery place . <p> Thai food is known for its sweet , salty , tangy , and spicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are phenomenal . Find a nearby Thai restaurant that has good reviews and take your family there . <h> 05 You Wont Be Able to Find Anything You Need <p> Most of our friends and family back home could n't believe that Chiang Mai was equipped with many malls , shopping centers , and superstores . Many supercenters actually dedicate entire floors to electronics , clothing , or beauty stores with familiar Western brands and products . These are some main stores : <p> Tesco Lotus <p> Big C Supercenter <p> Robinson Department Store <p> Makro <p> Tops Market <p> Central Department Store <p> Home Pro <p> Index Living Mall <p> This was one of the myths about Thailand we fell for originally . After visiting one of these western superstore equivalents , we were pleasantly surprised at how many products looked familiar . <h> 06 Thailand is For Drunks and Sex Tourists <p> While there is a dark side in Thailand that caters to substance abusers and sexpats , myths about Thailand being good for nothing else should not deter you from living here . Thailand boasts beautiful waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mountains and jungles for trekking . Cities like- Hua Hin and Chiang Mai , are family friendly and are much slower-paced than the bustling tourist areas and red-light districts of Bangkok . Peel back the layers and you 'll find Thailand is a wonderfully diverse and beautiful place to live . <h> 07 You Ca n't Afford to Live in Thailand <p> Myths about Thailands affordability being an issue are silly . Many things are incredibly affordable . For less than $5 you can <p> Try doing any of these things back home without blowing $20 or more ! Avoid budget blunders- just as you would back home and you 'll be fine . Although we do n't  recommend living on $500 per month like some people suggest , a couple can live comfortably- in Thailand for around $1,000 USD per person . <h> 08 Thailands Medical Care is Dirty and Dangerous <p> The next time someone tells you myths about Thailands medical or dental work being unsterilized , unsafe , or shotty , be sure to drop these facts : <p> Chris started Invisalign in the states in 2012 for around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have paid only $5,000 . <p> Laser eye surgery cost us $4,000 each in the US . The same procedure in Thailand costs around $2,000 . <p> These procedures can be done by English-speaking doctors , many of whom are trained in Western countries and practice with the most advanced medical equipment and techniques . <h> 09 You Wont be Connected With the Rest of the World <p> Thailand is an easy place to conduct business and maintain constant communication with your loved ones back home . You can stay connected with loved ones through countless WiFi hotspots available most often at coffee shops , restaurants , hotels , and guesthouses in major towns and cities . <p> While some countries are notorious for unreliable internet connections , Thailand is ahead of the game . Do n't  let the myths of Thailands lack of electricity and infrastructure lead you to believe there is also no internet ! <h> What Do Your Toughest Critics Have to Say Now ? <p> For the doubters amongst your friends and family who truly believe the myths about Thailand , this list should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand really has to offer as an expat living destination . <p> Been here 11 years and seen a lot of changes , especially the traffic .

Almost everyone of these " Statements " are somewhat true . The biggest thing to take away from this article is most of Thailand is safe and beautiful but its changing so quickly . And never visit during Songkran <p> Weve noticed changes since moving here , but it is still safe and beautiful and otherwise so well rounded . And Songkran well , we 've done most of the big festivals once and now prefer to stay inside : ) <p> Taking self defense classes to protect yourself is a good idea no matter where you live ( better safe than sorry ! ) But its also smart to avoid situations that may lead to problems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid starting confrontations . Hope your friend enjoyed their classes ! <p> Kudos to you for taking the leap of faith ! I have been researching other countries to relocate to live a simpler and cheaper life . Thailand seemed too intimidating until reading your story . Thanks so much for sharing it ! <p> Ive been sitting here for ten minutes trying to think of something else I could add to this list but all to no avail . Congrats on a very thorough and well-written piece of Thailand travel inspiration : ) <p> What impressed me with Thailand were the people . If more of the world were as nice and considerate it would be a better place . Being that I was a tourist , I had no idea that Thailand has the largest hospital in Asia . I was surprised at the medical care . <p> Oh , I love your point #7 . Isnt it weird what misconceptions and bizarre stereotypes are out there ? People think Canadians are overly polite and accommodating theyve never driven around Toronto in rush hour . I 've had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and friendly people . Good on you for spreading the good word ! <p> Thanks ! It is always very weird to hear people perpetuate negative things without much thought . Oh , and it seems like traffic gets people going most anywhereexcept for Chiang Mai ! We rarely hear any honking or yelling : ) <p> Toronto rush hour sounds like it might be a lot like rush hour where we used to live just outside of Washington DC ! Thanks for your comment Krystyna ! <p> What do you think a single frugal guy could live on in Chiang Mai ? I was living on about $1,300/mo here in the U.S. up until recently ( had to purchase health care due to ACA , and a car because my employer is moving ) . <p> I was thinking it might be possible to do $700/mo or so in northern Thailand . <p> No problem !

After hearing so many things bad and good about Thailand , we found out by ourselves that most of them are n't  true or at least they have been exaggerated . I guess thought its all to do with personal experiences and on how adaptable people are . <p> Oh I hate it when people make generalizations about a country ! We live in South Korea and believe me , we 've had an earful from a lot of people !

While you may need to take certain precautions ( do n't  go wearing your countrys flag on your shirt ) , its unfair when people jump to these conclusions .

We just smile and sometimes laugh at how absurd , sheltered , and scared people are . Every moment we think of our life in Thailand we glow with happiness . <p> Thanks Linda ! America has definitely embraced a fear based lifestyle . Only bad news makes it on the TV and it sometimes seems that way by design keeping everyone scared , walking in the pre-decided straight line , waiting patiently for there 80 hours of vacation every year . Then it is back to work , exhausted from the whirlwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it all went so quickly . We find it inspiring to see people wake up and see the bigger picture and do something about it . Looking forward to meeting you and Vince one day soon . Kudos Read more + <p> And of course " you will be washed away in a tsunami " along with " how will you handle all the fat , creepy , older guys with the young girls on their arms . " The " will you be safe there " question has been raised to the top of the list the last couple of days due to the western media now picking up on the protests . <p> It is just enough to make you realize how little people still know about the world they live in . Everyone still relies heavily on mainstream news , tv shows , and movies . Most will never take a trip to explore this side of the world simply because of fear of the unknown . It is truly sad , so we will just continue to remind ourselves of how lucky we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The protests have not had any kind of sway on daily life here whatsoever . We see it on our newsfeeds and it Read more + <p> Excellent post guys will be sending the link to some of our friends they might believe you , as they still do n't  believe us about Thailand ! We fly out to Bangkok today and its guys like you that have inspired us to try something new ! <p> I cant believe people think all these things about Thailand ! I must admit , I had n't  realised quite how developed it was until I got there especially with the medial care and the amazing shopping malls . The thing I love about Thailand is that if you 'd like a 5* hotel ( genuine 5* ! ) then you can find it but if actually want that bamboo bungalow on the beach then you can find that too . <p> We felt the same way when we first arrived . We totally agree on the accommodations ! We love our townhouse , but love being able to take a weekend and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Win Win : ) <p> Great post guys . We have heard all these myths before . Your analysis and insight is spot on . Were sending this on to our friends and family and if others will do the same , maybe people will begin to see the truth about how beautiful and friendly Thailand really is . Thanks <p> Haha , we see and hear the same reactions . We always have our Thailand defense ready to go should anyone accuse us of being nuts for living here . People either think what we are doing is crazy or awesome : ) <p> We hope she finds it helpful ! Parents will worry no matter what though . That is what they are there for : ) 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 7 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

We had a hard time finding detailed directions prior to our trip , so we would like to share our experience for those who will be making the same run in the near future , both to and from Chiang Mai to Vientiane to obtain our visas from the Thai Embassy . <h> Chiang Mai , Thailand to Vientiane , Laos <p> The adventure began at the Chiang Mai Arcade Bus Station ( Terminal 2 ) , which is located on Kaeo Narawat Road on the northeast outskirts of the Old City . <p> The day before our departure , we went to the Arcade Bus Station and purchased VIP tickets from the Chakrapong Tour Bus company , service to Udon Thani , Thailand from Kiosk 14 . The twelve-hour bus ride departs from Platform 6 at 8:00pm daily and costs 666 baht a person ( $21.50 USD as of June 2013 ) . We were told to be at the bus station thirty minutes prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a parking area that charges a small fee to park your vehicle overnight . There are several vendors selling snacks and drinks at the terminal . <p> NOTE : Tickets are non-refundable and can only be purchased with Thai cash . <p> Overnight VIP Bus tickets to Udon Thani from Chiang Mai <p> The bus departed promptly at 8:00pm . Bottled water , yogurt juice , and sweet bean paste filled buns were offered an hour into the ride . The seats were comfortable and reclined back for sleeping . The leg room easily accommodated passengers over six feet tall . Luggage was stored under the bus . The air conditioner was powerful and although passengers were provided blankets , we recommend socks and a light jacket to be comfortable . We did not confirm if there was a restroom on the bus but several stops were made throughout the night at various bus stations . <p> Interior of the double-decker bus <p> We arrived at 6:00am at the Udon Thani Bus Station 2 , which is located on the western outskirts of the city . We declined rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nong Khai , Thailand , a small town near the Thai-Laos border . We purchased two 40 baht bus tickets from a lady sitting at a small table by Platform 16 where the Nong Khai bus was parked . <p> NOTE : - If you have questions , the Information Desk at the Udon Thani Bus Station 2 is open this early in the morning . <p> The bus to Nong Khai was old , but it was quiet and only half full . It left at 6:50am , made several stops and by 8:30am we were within the Nong Khai city border . At one point , a tuk-tuk driver came aboard and asked if anyone was going to Laos . Several passengers , including ourselves , agreed to a ride to the Thai-Laos border for 50 baht a person . A five-minute ride later we were at the Friendship Bridge , a famous landmark that spans the Mekong River naturally separating Thailand and Laos . <p> TIP : If you are dropped off at an official bus stop in Nong Khai ( instead of on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songthaew to Friendship Bridge . Be sure the tuk-tuk driver takes you directly to the Friendship Bridge and not to a side business promising to process your Thai visa ! <p> Much different from the tuk-tuks we see in Chiang Mai <p> We were dropped off at the Thai-Laos border , but before we crossed the bridge we saw signs on booths that read " Immigration Checkpoint . " We stood in line , submitted our passports , completed departure cards , and received a departure stamp . Lost your departure card and need a replacement ? There should be a person nearby handing out replacements . <p> After passing though the immigration checkpoints , we purchased two 20- baht tickets for a bus ride across bridge from a ticket counter to the immediate right . We waited a few minutes and packed ourselves tightly onto one of the frequently crossing buses . <p> Once off the bus , we approached the sign that said " Visa On Arrival , " that is positioned above three counters . At Counter 2 , we obtained Laos Tourist Visa application forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know why this is backwards ) - we submitted our completed Laos visa forms and arrival cards , a single passport photo each , our passports , and cash . At Counter 3 , we picked up our passports with a new Laos visa and our change . <p> NOTE : A 30 day Laos Tourist Visa costs $35 USD OR 1500 baht ( about $45 USD equivalent ) . We read rumors that they charge an extra $1 if you do not have a photo , if its a weekend , or if it is during lunch . Exact change is not necessary ; we paid using a $100 bill and were given change back in USD . Make sure to bring crisp bills ! <p> We passed through the final checkpoint booth , showed the official our visas , and then were bombarded by tuk-tuk and taxi drivers . We bargained with them and accepted an air-conditioned van directly to the Royal Thai Consulate and split the cost with another passenger .

At about $350 USD a ticket , we decided to forgo this time-saving route in search for a cheaper , but still speedy alternative . <p> After picking up our Visas at 1:45pm we bartered with the taxi drivers waiting outside the Royal Thai Consulate . We agreed to take an air-conditioned van ride directly to the Friendship Bridge at the Laos-Thai border for 25,000 kip ( equivalent to 100 baht or $3.25 USD ) . We left the Thai Consulate at 2:00pm and within 30 minutes we were dropped off at the bridge . <p> After quickly going through the Lao Immigration Checkpoint we were approached by numerous taxi drivers ( notice a pattern ? ) each willing to take us over the bridge and directly to Udon Thanis International Airport for 300 baht per person .

We arrived at the airport at 4:00pm with plenty of time to grab an awesome Thai meal and reflect on our successful trip . <p> ALTERNATIVE : After getting a Laos departure stamp , you can ignore the taxis and buy a 4000 kip bus ticket across bridge to the Thai side .

Thanks for helping me to breathe easy about a process that can get rather muddled . One question , though : what if we are denied a visa , for some reason ? We are planning to leave half our stuff in Thailand and want to get back in , hehe . Can we get " locked out " ? How do we avoid that ? <p> You 're welcome ! If something happens and you are denied a visa , you 'll be able to get back into Thailand on a 30 day visa-exempt stamp . You can then xtend this for another 30 days so you will have 60 days total to figure out what to do next and to deal with your belongings . <p> I bought my bus tickets ; Chakrapong company ( not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side of the road ) : 840bhts VIP ticket , andstraight to Nong Khai , not need to transit from Udon Thani ! ( and they sell the tickets far in advance : mine , return ticket 10/13 january ) <p> first , thanks for your fast reply sorry to bother again , I can see on the visa application form : " name and contact of guarantor in Thailand , and also in LaoPDR " what am I suppose to write ? ? ? ? ? I have no " guarantor " ! ! ! <p> Ill have to apply for a tourist visa in Vientiane in january do they ask a plane ticket return ( Europe for me ) and they speak about proof of income on the consulate site ; do they ask some bank document ? Thanks <p> If you are apply for the single-entry Thai tourist visa , we believe that all you will need are a completed visa application form , 1,000 baht , two passport photos , and photocopies of your passport ( main photo page , entry stamp , and departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor bank statement is required . <p> Hello . Thanks for all the information . Its been really helpful and illuminating . My question pertains to people being denied a tourist visa after subsequent visa exempt stamps . I was hoping to head to Vientiane after two exempt stamps ( the second with an 30-day extension ) . Do you think I 'll have an issue with that few ? I just need a little more time while I hunt for a job . Thanks . <p> Two back-to-back visa exempt stamps should n't raise an alarm and we think you 'll be successful in applying for a single entry tourist visa to hold you over as you search for a job . Remember , dress nicely when applying do n't  go there looking like something the cat drug in ! and also look presentable in your photo ( haircut , clean shaven , collared shirt ) . Good luck ! <p> hi , wonderful blog and exactly what i needed . nok air had a flight for $49 , so i 'm flying from udon thani to chiang mai . question about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Udon Thani Int'l airport $3.20 dollars or 600 baht ? not sure which is a typo cuz they 're not equal , or maybe i 'm comprehending something wrong . i 'm traveling alone so just wanted to get a estimate of the cost . Also did you negotiate and get those prices lower or was that a special becuz it was two of you . thanks <p> Ah , thanks for for catching that . We 've updated the table to read 600 baht or $19.20 ( not $3.20 ) . Also , there were three of us in the cab , so we were offered 300 baht per person . If you can find another 2 or 3 person group to split the bill , that 's a great way to cut back on costs . <p> I got back to this page again , since I 'll be crossing the border soon , and I realized I do n't  have any passport photos with me anymore . <p> .. then upon researching , I found out that Asean countries are visa free . yay ! <p> Thanks for the tip again , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did n't  see any Chakrapong tour bus company . I only saw one that sells tickets to Udon Thani , which was beside the Green Bus ticketing booth , that costs way more than what you 've posted here . I might have missed it though , I have to look again . <p> Thank goodness for visa exempt stamps ! Thanks for the heads up on the Chakrapong tour bus company . There could be a few explanations ( wrong wing of thestation , maybe you were in the other bus station that is right beside this one ? ) , but it could also be simply they are n't  there any more since things change pretty often in Thailand . Good to know ! <p> Well , it seems that the visas regulations are going to change from august 29th , and for the best ; if I understand correctly , no more multiple visa exemptions but more easy for all others types of LONG ... <p> Yeah , they are cracking down on people who are trying to stay a long time in Thailand with repetitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage foreigners who want to stay for a long time to do so on a proper visa . <p> Just a heads up , I 'm doing the visa run for a tourist visa on Monday , going by land but getting a flight back . The flight was just over 2000baht with Nok Air so it might be worth looking at flights as well if anyone is planning on the trip , you can find some good deals . A few hundred extra baht and you fly quickly and in comfort rather than those much hated bus rides , no brainer ! <p> Last year , I could stay 5 months in CM without any problem , with a double entry visa , but no more available this year ; so , I intend to apply in Paris for a visa O ( 90 days ) and to go to Vientiane for a tourist visa would be perfect to complete my stay . I was wondering if they could refuse to me the tourist visa because its just after the visa O. What do you think or have your heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that immigration has been cracking down on people with several 30-day visa exempt stamps in their passports . Those same people , who are trying to enter Thailand on a tourist visa after such a long time with border runs evident in their passport , are being denied . Since you had a non-immigrant O and then a tourist visa , it does n't  sound like you will be denied entry under the current border control practices . Were glad to hear you are making plans to come back to Thailand ! <p> I 'm a retired teacher , the best 7 months of France , spring/summer , the best 5 months of Thailand , oct/march.and I was really concern that this so pleasant schedule could be in jeopardy , 3 years now , that I 'm spending the europeen winter in Chiang Mai , ; I rent a nice studio near the new Maya mall , Really great stay !

I saw a post that multiple entry visa are not possible to get in Laos but does this 60+30 day visa thing relate to that or not ? Also I read it was $150 for the 6 month double entry visa . I have to pay for myself and my gf so that would be $300 which is expensive . Any insight please asap would be appreciated . <p> You may be able to get a double entry Thai visa at the Thai Consulate/Embassy in Laos , but chances are they might only issue you a single entry . Each 60 day entry costs 2000 baht , which is about $60 USD , so a double entry costs about $120 USD ( but you must pay in baht ) per person . The extra 30 days can be obtained at the very end of your 60 days by going to any local immigration office ( there are at least one in each province/ " state " ) .

I love Thailand , and would love to explore it as well .

Hoping to make good use of it on my next visit . <p> I 'm a fan of night markets so always went to Hua Hins night market for dinner .

Spent an entire day lounging at Suanson Pradipat . <p> Thank you Chris and Angela . My wife and I are planning to cross the border onto Vientiane , coming from either Bangkok by train or Chiang Mai by bus or train if available . Weve crossed borders on foot before , going from Turkey to Bulgaria , and from the Oman to the UAE . For some reason , we are very nervous about the complexities of border crossing on this side of Asia . So we hope the whole thing is not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input . <p> The Friendship bridge border crossing is very popular , as is Vientiane to go for a visa run . If your bus or train goes through there , your border crossing should go smoothly . Were glad you found this post useful ! <p> We arrived on a Friday and picked our visa up the next business day which was a Monday . If you do not want to stay for the entire weekend you can show up Monday-Thursday and pick your visa up the very next day . Here is a link for more information about our experience and visa requirements . Best of luck ! <p> No problem ! Hopefully you were able to buy your bus ticket . We have been able to purchase them the day prior and on the same day . Buying the ticket the same day wont give you the best selection of seats though . Good luck on your trip ! <p> Hey guys , someone suggested to me to use a service like Aya. 1,500 THB return trip . Bus goes from CM to Vientiane thai embassy but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got to get back over the border . Seems like a very comparative price without the hassle of changing transport . Thoughts ? <p> I did it once . Yes , its a good service . I 'm in Laos right now waiting for the new visa . The good thing is the price and the service . They drive you everywhere and wait for you until you get to the Thai Embassy , you cant go wrong . The last time there was a family who overstayed and we got a bit late but everything was ok at the end . Now , I 'm trying to do it by myself by VIP bus due to more comfort and freedom from laggards . Its getting a bit more expensive and I do n't  know next time Read more + <p> You 're right about AYA . We looked into that option first and it is affordable and much more direct , but it is in a 12 or 16 van or " minibus " ( if we remember correctly ) . With the 12+hr ride from CM to Vientiane , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep during the trip . We ended up taking the VIP bus because the seats recline and we know we can be generally comfortable and get a few Zs in . If the van is n't full , you could probably get comfortable , but that 's a risk we werent willing to take . AYA Read more + <p> Hi Guys I need to do the same run , however , reluctant to travel that way by bus . After that experience , would you recommend just a return flight from CNX to Vientiene to get the 60+30 day visa ? Thank you Kevin Huber <p> Hey Kevin , actually the bus ride is n't so bad at all . If you follow our guide you should n't have too many issues unless things have somehow changed . If you have money to spend and are n't  on a tight budget then flying is definitely a great option . Chris would rather fly most of the time while I do n't  mind road travel so we usually come to the agreement of busing it one way and then flying on the way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Good luck on your visa run ! <p> No problem at all . We actually paid the driver in Thai Baht . The seemed very flexible , but not sure if they would accept US Dollars . Just make sure you are getting a good exchange rate no matter which route you decide to try . <p> Thank you ! We hope that others can benefit from our experience .

We did n't  have tags immediately either and did n't  worry and did n't  get in trouble .

@@59574750 @8574750/ <h> Hua Hin : A Potential Second Home <p> The southern Thai town of Hua Hin is often compared to Chiang Mai but with the added bonus of boasting many nearby beaches . We took a four-day trip to recon the area and ended up getting a really great first impression . Here are our thoughts on Hua Hin as a potential second home that we may end up choosing to settle down in during Chiang Mais hot and smokey season . <h> The Feel <p> Hua Hin has a big town feel with its many multi-story buildings , major indoor shopping areas , outdoor night bazaars , hotels , and restaurants along about 10 km of coastline . There are a number of areas with new construction and modern looking buildings , and even the more established shops , restaurants , and bars a few turns off the main drag were visually well cared for . Businesses seemed to be doing well , and it felt like a clean , progressive , and successful beach town . Being that Hua Hin is often home to Thai Royalty all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The beach at Hua Hin is pretty expansive but the coastline is n't overtaken by towering hotels and resorts fighting for prime real estate . In fact , two times we stumbled onto the beach when our small- soi- abruptly ended and the sand began in between some small , seaside restaurants . We found this refreshing being that the beaches where we come from are hard to reach because of overcrowded and poorly designed small parking areas . <p> Wat Khao Takiap . At this temple monkeys can be seen playing and swimming <p> The sand is mix of light tan and grey , and the waters are a darker grey blue , which are unlike the white sands and crystalline waters of the beaches of the furthest southern areas of Thailand . The coastline is overall very pretty and ends at a mountainside Buddhist temple . The beach slopes so gradually into the Bay of Thailand that you can walk out very far and only find yourself waist-deep in water . Other areas of Hua Hins coast are somewhat hidden , and on some evenings the only people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thai teenagers playing sports , and men offering half hour-long horse rides down the quiet shores . <p> Horses on the beach just a bit south of the main drag of Hua Hin . <h> The Food <p> Ah , the seafood ! Seafood is abundant in Hua Hin and there are plenty of waterfront restaurants at which to dine . Shrimp , crabs , squid , fresh whole fish , steamed mussels and clams were on most menus . This was sorely missed seeing as Chiang Mai is land locked and we only occasionally eat seafood . <p> There are an impressive number of formal dining restaurants and a good choice of restaurants serving international cuisine , including Irish pubs , Russian , Chinese , and Italian restaurants . <p> Shrimp Pad Thaione of the best yet <p> As for the local food , we drove down streets where there are many affordable permanent food stalls and street stalls selling the Thai classics as well as an array of freshly caught seafood . There are also many mobile food vendors to be found in the night bazaar areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of coffee shops which is very typical of Thailand . <p> Primitive coffee from the Coffee Corner Cafe <p> Thankfully we found that the food in Hua Hin was n't much more expensive than the food in Chiang Mai- ( 10 to 20 baht more for most plates ) , especially when we ventured off the normal tourist path in search for places favored heavily by the locals . <h> The Night Life <p> You do n't  have to look far to find a good night life in Hua Hin . We were lucky enough to be there on a weekend and ventured down a series of waterfront streets that had the music bumping and club lighting . Drinks are reasonably priced ( same as Chiang Mai ) and there are plenty of places to play pool and to meet pretty ladies , if that 's your thing . <h> Getting Around <p> Chris on our rented motorbike <p> Hua Hin has a major four lane highway running north and south along the coastline . There are a number of stop lights , both on the main drag and on major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cars seemed to be the preferred mode of transportation which added to the congestion . We did visit during a holiday weekend , so the vacationers probably added to the normal traffic levels. - Even so , it was n't bad because we zipped through most of the traffic on our rented motorbike , which also allowed us to ride down those narrow- sois- in the downtown area which can be merely the width of a car ! <p> We noticed many more cars here than what we usually see in Chiang Mai . <p> As for public transportation , there are plenty of tuk-tuks , taxis and even motorbike taxis ( recommended if you are traveling solo ) . We did n't  see many conventional- songtaews , but we did see these cool looking mini semi truck/tuk-tuk crossbreeds , as well as familiar looking tuk-tuks . We had Motorbike rental shops are few and far between , but there is no shortage of ways to get around . For longer distance ground transportation , there is a bus station and a train station , both which we utilized arriving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Verdict on Hua Hin <p> After confirming that this beach town was as clean , free of a major tourist footprint , and the cost of living is about the same as in Chiang Mai , we can say that it is a strong contender for a second home during the hot and smokey season that bears down on you in Chiang Mai three months out of the year. - We talked to many expats that told us they lived in large houses , or amenity rich condos for less than 8,000 baht per month ( less than $300 USD ! ) , so our $1,200 a month budget should go very far in this part of Thailand . We took note of plenty of new construction and countless waterfront condos and resort neighborhoods that were priced at around 2.5 million baht ( around $80,000 USD ) . We have a few more locations to check out , but Hua Hin definitely seems impossible to beat at this point ! <p> The good news is that there are plenty of options of international insurance for expats , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan you chose in Thailand with that of your existing coverage in the USA and weight the pros and cons . Obviously age and pre-existing conditions matter hugely some insurances may not even cover you if you are above a certain age or have had , say , cancer before so there 's no one-size-fits-all answer . On the flip side , medical procedures and medication are about 20% of the uninsured cost in the USA , so its a Read more + <p> After living in the USA for 23 years , my Thai wife and I will soon be moving to Thailand either to Hua Hin or Wang Nam Khiao ( gateway to Korat ) .

Anyway many thanks again guys . <p> Chiang Mais housing market is pretty stable -prices have stayed the same for at least a decade ! You 're right , cheap homes generally are n't  listed on websites catering to foreigners . At least , not the popular ones that come up on the first page of Google .

Were planning on going there in a few weeks and staying a month to 6 weeks . Weve been in Bangkok the last 2 weeks . Maybe you guys can help me with something that 's frustrating me . You mention apartments in the $300 range . We were also told the same thing in Bangkok but as we 've found out , its hard to find a short term apartment ( 1-2 months ) anywhere in that range .

Good post , kind of helped us decide that Hua Hin would be our next stop ! Frank ( bbqboy ) <p> Hey , it happens !

Its always good to hear about another honest point of view . <p> Hi Chris and Angela , my husband Rick and I will be moving to HH in December this year . We chose it over CM , mainly because of the incredible water views and so many like 17 beaches from Cha-Am down past Dolphin Bay and beyond . We could n't resist the ocean with it breezes . Not saying CM is very nice also , but a lot busier and we did n't  want to be there when the smokes comes either . We want to base and go and investigate new places and areas from HH . By the way , love your blog , its so informative . <p> Hua Hin is a great choice ! This city reminded us of a smaller Chiang Mai on the water . The plethora of beaches and lack of a smokey season makes it very popular place for expats . We have obligations from keeping us from moving there , but ideally we would spend three months in Hua Hin during the smokey season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) <p> My wife and I cant decide . We love the mountain views but also the beaches . I have n't spent enough time in Thailand to know all the different areas but the only place like that I can think of is down by Phuket .. and that can be expensive , not to mention the traffic . We also want cheap cost of living . Her concern with Hua Hin or sth down South is the cost of food in more tourist areas . We are looking to rent a place for a month on each of our next vacations to see what we think . Our next trip Read more + <p> We 've heard Hua Hin is more expensive than Chiang Mai , but we cant resist being near a beach for a few months . We will probably opt for living a little farther away from the main strip to avoid the touristy areas , and hopefully that will reflect in slightly lower housing and food prices . <p> Checking out a place on your vacation is the way to go . We 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip in that part of Thailand this year . We would love to know your first impressions of the place ! <p> Hey guys great post ! I was wondering if you 've come any closer to deciding where to go and when ? My husband and I are in Chiang Mai for the winter and have gotten so many mixed reports on how bad the smoke really is . Were contemplating leaving too but absolutely love Chiang Mai so its hard : ) . Hua Hin looks like a great alternative though thanks so much for the info ! <p> We are still planning to live in Hua Hin for a few months during the hot and smokey season . We will probably write about our experiences there and if it really is less smokey than Chiang Mai . Let 's hope so ! <p> Hi Chris , Hope you and your wife enjoyed your stay at The Bee and B. I am sorry we did not personally have the pleasure to meet you , but we were stuck in the USA at the time . Please drop me a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the best places in town . Cheers , Deron <p> Hey Deron , we actually had a great time exploring Hua Hin and we really enjoyed your staying at your guest house too . Your friends Z and Em were great company and definitely made us feel at home . Hope to meet up with you next time we swing through . Take care ! <p> i went to hua hin couple mouth ago i feel peaceful fulfilled with art and culture and history i want to have a house at hua hin too but food expensive more than normal price 1000% it just simple dish that i can buy at the market in the morning just 25 bath <p> I am very familiar with Hua Hin and I think your overview is quite accurate . Note that the town gets very busy at weekends since it is popular with Thais travelling down from Bangkok and it is also popular with foreign tourists between November and February . The beaches around the town are OK but if you head South towards Prachuap Khiri Khan(Mueang) you will discover miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Pranburi are also a feature .

We actually caught ourselves talking about that very idea quite a bit while we were there . 161249 @qwx571249 <p> 3 years 11 months ago 161248 @qwx571248

Not only does the rain make for rather cool mornings , it also clears the air of the dust that has accumulated during the dry , hot season . That makes for a much better views ! - To put it in perspective , some days during the hot smokey season the mountain was n't visible at all . - If you werent from Chiang Mai you would n't even know that you were missing out on such a great view . <p> Another view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see a crystal clear view of Chiang Mais famous mountain .

Maybe we will drop by for a few drinks one evening soon ! <p> Cool , I might recommend that condo to friends to check out , cat-less friends of course .

@@59574757 @8574757/ <h> Dos and Donts of The Yacht Week Thailand <p> Throwing- a party on a boat can be a blast but spending an entire week on a yacht takes fun- to the next- level ! Since we already had plans to be in southern Thailand in December , there was no way wed turn down our invitation go to The Yacht Week Thailand . Sailing in the Andaman Sea on a yacht , you do n't  say ? ! - Weve never- done anything of- this caliber , so what should we have expected as- first-timers ? <p> If this is the first time you 've heard of The Yacht Week , let 's just say its an incredible mashup of partying and sightseeing while exploring the seas on a bona fide yacht . The Yacht Week originated in Croatia but has blown up to include tours around- Turkey , Italy , the British Virgin Islands , Greece , and yes , Thailand . <p> Since- we have never been to The Yacht Week before and had conjured up certain images and expectations of the trip as we excitedly packed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight to the event for others who are itching to go . Even though wed love to go into the nitty gritty of preparing for The Yacht Week , " how to " guides have been done here , here , and here so well be providing- a different twist on the trip : <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Jan 6 , 2016 at 6:47pm PST <p> We saw some absolutely fabulous rock formations , beaches , and sunsets as we sailed around a dozen or so- beaches and islands on our route in the Andaman Sea . And of course , the sailboats themselves were a beautiful sight along the horizon , particularly during the regatta and when they formed the famous yacht ring . <p> A photo posted by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Dec 25 , 2015 at 3:17am PST <p> As we bounced from place to place we also stopped for an hour or two at small islands with famous sites- like Maya Bay Beach ( early in the morning before the crowds got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hong Island , James Bond Island , and Tup Island . <h> Do n't  Go for the Sailing <p> Ironically this trip is more about sightseeing and having fun and less about- the demands of skillfully sailing- a yacht in the open seas . In fact , during our trip , the- skipper only raised the sails and cut the engines once and that was only for about an hour and a wonderfully peaceful hour it was ! Looking back on it , there just was n't adequate wind power to meet the demands of our rigorous island hopping schedule . We did raise the sails again for the regatta but we cheated a bit and used the engines . <p> If you are a sailing fanatic and want more sail time , it might be better to be the captain of your own boat so that you- can make executive decisions and choose when you want to sail . However , agreeing to this is a huge- responsibility and means less partying ! Bottom line : chances are you wont be able to indulge in your sailing hobby as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go for the Outrageous Parties ! <p> From the moment- we- woke up to the time we- stumble to bed , we were- celebrating in one form or another . Cocktails before noon ? Yep . Inflatable floaty parties and island hopping during the day ? Definitely . And every evening we could- expect to either go to beachside clubs or some sort of themed party . <p> It is exhausting but exhilarating. - We recommend getting plenty of sleep during the week leading up to the trip because you 'll be lucky to get more than a few hours of rest at- night ! <h> Do n't  Go for the Excursions <p> Although we did a- lot- of island hopping during The Yacht Week Thailand , it was difficult to find the time for big daytime excursions when we stopped at the larger islands . <p> We had made a list of things to do on the islands . It included going to an- overlook on Koh Phi Phi , walking a dog at- the- Lanta Animal Welfare on Koh Lanta , and going rock climbing on Railay . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we only had about an hour or two on the island . These side trips were just too time-consuming to fit into our schedule . However , we did have enough time to do a little shopping , get a massage , and enjoy a freshly brewed espresso ( a nice change from the instant coffee we were consuming on the yacht ! ) <h> Do Go to Relax <p> Even with all the partying , there is plenty of opportunities to relax . This is especially true once- brunch cocktails are finished- and before afternoon cocktails begin . We 'd either stretch ourselves out on the bows deck to sunbathe- or lounge in a water floaty . Its time to play some summer tunes- and enjoy the gentle waves and gorgeous views . We loved that there was no- obligation to do anything on this trip if we did n't  want to ! <h> Do n't  Go to be Pampered <p> Although the boats are impressive , there are multiple champagne parties , and its possible to hire a hostess and skipper to cook and sail for you during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are small ( bathrooms for you non-sailin folk ) and you may even have to manually pump the toilets . Cabins and galleys can get cluttery in the blink of an eye , there is a limited supply of utility water on board , and seasickness may be biting at your heels . Everyone needs to work as a team to keep the yacht clean , safe , and fun . This might- mean taking out trash and scrubbing toilets from time to time . <h> Do Go for the People <p> Ah , the people ! The- Yacht Week Thailand hosts 16 yachts of- nearly 180 twenty and thirty-somethings from around the world . Our boat had guys and gals- from Sweden , America , and- Israel . Our friends yacht had people from the UK , Australia , Argentina , and Istanbul. - We boarded with- eight unfamiliar yet smiling faces looking at us and by the end of the trip , we were like old friends . Once the event is over , its not uncommon for people- to stay in touch and long-term friendship and romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chris and Angela Scott ( @tielandtothailand ) on Jan 6 , 2016 at 4:15am PST <p> We firmly encourage fun , sociable singles and couples to go on The Yacht Week Thailand and party it up together . However , if you come with a significant other in hopes of- a romantic getaway , this event is not for you . Although the boats are big they are n't  that big . The rooms are even smaller , so there 's very little privacy away from other members of your crew . Two , this is a social event that 's all about mingling and having fun with many people Its not meant for staring into each others eyes 24/7 . <h> Packing Essentials for The Yacht Week Thailand <p> Bring essentials like daytime cover-ups , slip-on boat shoes , hair clips or bands to keep long tresses out of your face , and several pairs of sunglasses . Definitely err on the dressier , more stylish side for evening wear , so guys should bring a handful of collared polos and board shorts and gals should opt for sundresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white attire for the White Party , and water floaties ! <p> But absolute must haves ? Check it out : <p> 3+ bathing suits : - Or four . Or even five . They are essentially your outfits for the day and double as underwear . For real . Just make sure you bring real undies to wear with- your evening outfits . Bringing multiple bathing suits will allow you to rotate them out , giving adequate time between washing and air drying , and break up those tan lines . <p> Battery pack : Electrical outlets are very limited on the boat and there 's a small chance that the one in your room does n't  work or your plugs do n't  fit . Youll be SOL the ENTIRE week . We brought an Eloop E14 20,000 Mah Power Bank- ( its a beast ! ) but we were able to repeatedly charge our phones ( and even share juice with our crew ) and it lasted the entire week . Also , bring a cigarette plug adapter with multiple USB ports ( needed for phones and cameras ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc ) are also a must ! <p> Fully charged cordless electric razor : - Men and women both , trust us on this one . Fully charged . Cordless . Trying shaving your legs , face , and other areas when the boat is rocking in an itsy bitsy bathroom with only cold water . Its a challenge ! - This is a life saver since everyones nearly nude the entire week . <p> Waterproof bag/phone case : Absolutely bring a waterproof case for your electronics . If you are taking a camera , investing in a waterproof bag ( dry bag ) is also essential the island transfers are done by longtail boat and dinghy . If you have a phone , invest in a waterproof case or an underwater bag . You do n't  want to accidentally drop your electronics- in the sea as you get on and off the boats ! If you do , follow these- tips for saving electronics from salt water- ( these tips are NOT the same if you drop it in fresh water ) ! <p> Dry shampoo and baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , chances are you wont be taking more than a sponge bath on the boat for the entire week . Dry shampoo ( or even baby powder ) keeps your roots dry . It can also double as body powder to keep sticky , sweaty skin at bay . Baby wipes keep your important bits fresh and clean when a shower is not a realistic option . <p> Your countrys flag : Not only does it show national pride but its the perfect way to identify your boat among the dozens among the fleet . Yachts look surprisingly similar- identical during the nighttime , especially after you 've had a few drinks . Going around in circles in a boat transfer at 3am is a buzzkill and frustrations can escalate quickly . <p> NOTE : After much boating experience and the tendency to get cold in the evenings , The Yacht Week Thailand in December was still warm even after the sun went down . Bring no more than one thin , long-sleeved hoodie and save space in your suitcase for something else . <h> Do n't  Bother Packing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home during the- trip : <p> Big electronics : Do n't  bring a laptop or any electronics other than a phone and small camera . You wo n't get any work done anyways. - Plus , its hard to maintain a full battery when the yacht does n't  have electricity during the day and unreliable electrical hookups at night . <p> Heels , sneakers , boots : Slip-ons and flip-flops are the way to go . You will break your neck if you wear heels . Forget wedges , too . <p> A hard suitcase : A soft duffle bag or suitcase is a MUST . Hard cases , even the small ones , WILL NOT FIT in the cabins unconventionally shaped storage areas . Make sure to keep it carry-on sized only . If you have to check your bag , you 've packed too much and its- going to be too big ! <p> The Yacht Week Thailand is n't a year-round event . Instead , its currently scheduled for three one-week sessions in December and in the beginning of January dubbed Week 51 , Week 52 , and Week 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so do n't  forget to bring Christmas and New Years costumes ! <p> G " PIN THIS POST FOR LATER G " <p> DISCLOSURE : We were guests of this event but our opinions of The Yacht Week Thailand are our own . <p> Cabin bookings are G1,400 per person and cover the cost of two meals per day , water , skipper , hostess , and yacht fees ( like gas ) ; alcohol , airfare , and meals off the yacht are excluded . Yacht bookings are around G800 per person but all other expenses are paid for by you . <p> We hear The Yacht Week Croatia is out of this world ! We got our best sunset time lapse video on the shores of Koh Lanta during The Yacht Week . If you have n't already , check out our Things to Do on Koh Lanta post . PS , Hope you enjoyed watching the Super Bowl during the wee morning hours . So different watching the game and drinking coffee , huh ? 161248 @qwx571248 
@@59574758 @8574758/ <h> How to Teach Yourself Thai <p> Being expats in Thailand , Chris and I understand the long-term benefits and practicality of learning the Thai language . We will definitely enroll in a Thai language program in Chiang Mai in the coming months . Meanwhile , I have been self-teaching myself how to speak and read beginner Thai using several different methods . If you are thinking about staying in Thailand for more than six months and want to teach yourself Thai , check out my recommendations . <h> Teach Yourself to Speak Thai <p> The best way to teach yourself conversational Thai is to do what babies do . Listen and repeat . The audiobook provides roughly fifteen hours of conversation from which you can teach yourself Thai by listening to and repeating the dialogue . <h> Why I Like Pimsleur- Thai <p> I like that Pimsleur Thai introduces new words or phrases one at a time , most of which I learned through context . This method helped me retain the new vocabulary better than traditional word drills . I also like that the conversation length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life situations . During every conversation , small sections are repeated several times , which gave me time to absorb everything . After listening to Pimsleurs Thai , I was more comfortable with sentence structure , repeating the proper tones , and understanding common topics , such as ordering food from a restaurant , asking how much something costs , and telling time in Thai . It is also available on CD- and- iTunes . <p> TIP : Listen to Pimsleurs Thai during your work commute , which can be a great time to practice . <h> Teach Yourself to Read and Write Thai <p> If you want to take it a step further and teach yourself Thai characters in order to read and write , Complete Thaiis a wonderful book-CD combo to use . Within each chapter , new vocabulary and short conversations are provided . This helps you reaffirm the Thai alphabet and strengthen your reading skills . The optional CDs also provide extra listening material . <h> Why I Like Complete- Thai <p> This book is different from many beginner Thai books because it breaks down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter while gradually introducing the infamous five tone rules of the Thai language . This is better than being handed a long list of consonants ( 44 ! ) and vowels ( 32 ! ) with their respective sounds. - Complete Thai also showed me the proper pen strokes needed to create each character . Because Thai is a very phonetic language , I was quickly on my way to reading basic Thai after learning the characters and tone rules . <h> Teach Yourself Thai Grammar <p> This book is a dry read , but the breadth of grammar topics covered within this book is quite extensive and provides an excellent foundation for the Thai language . <h> Why I Like- Thai : An Essential Grammar <p> I think this book is a one-stop-shop for grammar rules. - It- does an excellent job of breaking down Thai grammar , which quickly diverges from English grammar beyond simple sentences . Direct translation only goes so far ! I also like that it provides tons of vocabulary and small phrases among the grammar rule examples . If anything , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you teach yourself Thai. - It is available in paperback or Kindle Edition . <h> Yes , You Can Teach Yourself Thai <p> It takes dedication and determination to learn Thai outside of a traditional classroom setting , but it can be done ! If you are passionate about learning beginner Thai and want to teach yourself , I recommend any of the above books . Ive been extremely happy with my progress using them . Its exciting when you begin to understand and take part in basic Thai conversations around you . <p> Have you tried learning Thai yet ? - Would you rather stick to a classroom setting or is it worth it to try to teach yourself ? Do you think it is better to focus your efforts on conversation or is it worth it to learn to read and write , too ? <p> Complete Thai by David Smyth , I have that , and its excellent for the alphabet , as you have said . Its interesting that there are a lot of different books , each one teaches a different style or thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half-Price books is a good resource , if you live near one . A few dollars goes a long way . You can pick up cultural guides , sometimes , also . Thai language books are n't  as common as French , German , Italian , but they exist .

I have been studying with a teacher named Miki . She is a very intelligent and talented teacher living in Bangkok . Miki and her older sister Tachaya are both Thai/English Teachers and they have developed their own thai language website : here is the link to it ( pickup-thai.com ) . They also have developed an on-going Podcast series that has a two-tiered learning study focus : ( 1 ) for Beginner learners ; and ( 2 ) for Intermediate to Advanced learners of Thai . The Podcast series is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with languages , there are so many different ways of studying . I know a lot of people here in Bangkok that have signed up for expensive two or three months " intensive " beginner courses only to tell me that its still difficult and they are struggling . You do n't  get to talk much in the classroom as well as direct feedback from the teacher and that 's so important for a tonal language like Thai . As for myself , I just bought a textbook and studied all by myself during the first 6 months , and just applied the vocabulary that I have learned Read more + <p> Self studying takes a lot of discipline , but you can get pretty far at your own pace . Supplemented with a tutor to fine-tune things like tones and sentence structure or pronunciation is great . Glad to hear you 're well on your way to being comfortable speaking Thai .

Interaction with a native speaker is one of the best ways to reinforce what you have learned through self study . We try to practice with our Thai friends whenever we are out and about . Thanks for sharing . <p> I agree 100% that learning Thai is essential for the long term . Thanks for the book ideas . A free youtoob search of Thaipodcast.com is worth it too . There are many free lessons that can get you started . They break down the phrases well and repeat them slowly with a native Thai speaker . <p> No problem Roger ! Youtube is a fantastic resource .

@@59574759 @8574759/ <h> Our $500 Per Month Townhouse in Chiang Mai <p> Curious about housing costs in Thailand ? Before moving to Thailand , we were always excited to learn about the different long-term housing options and what we could expect to pay . It helped to confirm our desire to move to there ! Now its time we share our experience with you . here 's a look at the two-story townhouse in Chiang Mai we 've called home for the past year . <p> Before moving to Chiang Mai , we budgeted 10,000 to 15,000 baht per month ( $330 to $500 ) for rent . We wanted a place near the Old City that had at least one bedroom , a small kitchen , and was pet friendly . <p> We managed to find a brand new townhouse in Chiang Mai , just outside the Old City 's moat for 15,000 baht per month ( $500 USD ) . For being so close to the city center , we thought this 150 sq m ( 1600 sq ft ) townhouse with two bedrooms and three bathrooms was a good find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the things we immediately loved about our townhouse in Chiang Mai was that it was private . We liked being tucked at the end of a small moo baan ( neighborhood ) . We also had our own gated patio where we could park our motorbike and sit outside . <h> Downstairs <p> Our townhouse was huge , but only came furnished with basic Thai-styled furniture . The downstairs living room furniture was functional but could have been a little more comfortable . Sometimes we missed having the big soft sofa we had back in the US ! <p> As with most homes in Thailand , ours did n't  have central air conditioning . We ended up buying a small wall fan that kept the living room comfortable most of the time . The tile floor also helped to keep things cool , which provided us with a nice place to get work done . <p> We had several English channels to watch on our small TV . If we needed a break , wed sometimes watch movies or American cop drama marathons . Yes , were guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order rerunsespecially during Chiang Mais rainy nights or its hot and hazy days ! <p> After searching for a place with a Western kitchen , we admittedly used ours much less than we thought we would . We had a single burner , which required a lot of effort and creativity to cook familiar meals from back home . It was actually more convenient to simply buy prepared food from our local market or go out to eat at the many nearby Thai kitchens . However , having a kitchen with a tall fridge , dual microwave/conduction oven , plenty of counter space , and a sink all within arm 's reach ( and not outside ) was a lot more than what your average Thai home would typically offer . <h> Upstairs <p> Upstairs was the bedroom area . Both of our bedrooms were very large and- came with king sized beds , air conditioners , and balconies . We 've noticed that king sized beds are not uncommon in Thailand , even in some of the smallest studio apartments ! We had a decent view of Doi Suthep from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our laundry out to dry . <p> Both upstairs- bedrooms had on-suite bathrooms with Western toilets and hot- showers . The bathrooms reflected a little Thai style , with quirky tiles , no shower curtains , and bum guns . One of the bathrooms was built with the toilet right next to the shower head , which was something we never got used to . <h> The Neighborhood <p> We lived in a quaint little Thai neighborhood that had a mini-mart , a place to do laundry , and a filtered water dispenser within a short walking distance of our place . The mini-mart in our neighborhood was perfect for grabbing some cold drinks or packaged snacks if we did n't  want to venture out too far . Across from the mini-mart was where we did our laundry ( about 30 baht per load ) and bought our drinking water ( 1 baht per 1.5 liters ) . We also had friendly neighborhood dogs , cats , roosters , and even a well-loved long-haired rabbit that would hop around without a care . Yep , that 's right , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or each other . <h> The Unexpected <p> After living in our place for a year , we admit that werent unhappy to move somewhere new . Although it served us well , and accommodated our visiting friends and family on many occasions , there were some quirks about our townhouse in Chiang Mai . We learned a lot about some of the oddities of homes in Thailand as the year progressed . <p> Partially Furnished ( Uncomfortable Wooden Furniture ) : We though about re-furnishing and decorating the downstairs area with comfortable Western style furniture , but it being our first year in Thailand , we did n't  want to spend a lot of money just in case things did n't  work out . This being the case , the townhouse remained fairly bare with its original heavy wood furniture . <p> Poor Plumbing : One of the bathrooms emitted a funny smell from the shower drain and sink . Proper U-bend piping would have made a big difference . <p> Bug Invasions : The front doors slid open and had a wide unsealed gap at the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ( much to the pleasure of our cat ) . <p> Karaoke Bars : Although our neighborhood was quiet and peaceful during the day , it was another story at night . Had we made a late night run to the neighborhood , we would have saved ourselves a year of off-key wails from the dozen all-night karaoke bars on the road 100 meters behind us . <h> Finding a Townhouse in Chiang Mai <p> Although we searched many online listings , we found our townhouse in Chiang Mai through word of mouth . A Thai friend of ours , who worked at a restaurant we often visited , told us about it after we were asked to move out of our studio apartment . The townhouse fit our budget and was pet friendly , so we moved right in . <p> We definitely recommend speaking with a Thai local when looking for a place to live . Being that this was our first townhouse in Chiang Mai , we were happy with its cost , condition , and close proximity to the Old City . With that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to be a bit too much for us and decided to find something more appropriate for two people . <p> Were happy to say that as of April 2014 we 've moved into a smaller and less expensive two bedroom two bathroom detached house . It is fully furnished , modern , and more our style . The best part is that we live near the same neighborhood we have grown to love and appreciate over the last year . We will miss many things about our first long-term home in Thailand , but we are looking forward to a new beginning ! <p> Unfortunately there are still no pet friendly condos or apartments in Chiang Mai that 's a citywide " rule " . You can find a pet friendly hotel for the first few weeks or first month you are here while you search for a more permanent home or townhouse . The owner/landlord may allow pets , but this will be on a case by case basis . We offer assistance in finding pet friendly places in addition to offering loads of other advice in our Coaching Sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences for budget , location , style , number of rooms , etc . Let Read more + <p> HAHA ! Actually we mopped these floors the old fashion way . This type of tile was a bit of a problem . They were very nice , but the reflection and color made it so hard to see where we needed to sweep ! Ugh , cleaning took forever . We much prefer the lighter floors in our new place . <p> Cool , this makes me feel hopeful that we may be able to find a decent 3 bedroom at a good price . We have n't decided how long we will stay in Chiang Mai , but we are thinking a minimum of 3 months Oct-Dec . I am not sure how I will adjust to the " creepy crawlies " , but I guess I will .

But .. 500$ for such a big house ! Seriously ? Wow ! <p> Hello Allan , thank you so much for visiting our blog . We have seen so much about how cold this past winter has been for you all in Canada and the US . It all sounds so awful . Thailand is definitely a place where you cash goes very farespecially on housing , utilities , and food . If you venture 5 to 10 KM outside of the city center you can expect to pay around $300 for something comparable to our townhouse . We really enjoy the accessibility of being so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quiet you could stretch Read more + <p> Thanks , Philippe . The bug actually werent too bad at all .

My husband is retired military and has a GI Bill too and is looking into Payap University , while I teach at an international school there . Its been 12 years since I last visited Thailand . We are leaving lucrative jobs here too for a chance at a more fulfilling life . <p> Hi Melanie , I have n't began to use the GI Bill yet , but have spoken to a guy recently who went to Payap for his degree not too long ago . He seemed to enjoy it . I am waiting until we get some of our long-term trips out of the way . It sounds like you and your husband are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big move ! <p> Seems like a decent place . The price is good for what you had . There is no real zoning here , thus Karaoke bars near homes . What is worse , is if you buy a condo or home not in a gated area , and then someone makes a Karaoke , late Thai bar , or motor bike repair shop next door . For the future , do n't  get water from the local filtered water dispensers . There have been a few reports on them that they are not maintained properly and full of various bacteria . <p> Hi Steve , thanks so much for your comment . The zoning issues can be a headache , but we much prefer it to the western world . There is much more of a community feel in our opinions . We used the same filtered machine for a year without incident . We regularly saw it being serviced and maintained .

@@59574760 @8574760/ <h> Our New House in Chiang Mai <p> By popular request , were sharing the details of our new house in Chiang Mai . Its cozy , its modern , and its a place where we feel completely comfortable . We cant help but feel excited to share what we call home these days ! <p> When our lease was ending at our first townhouse in Chiang Mai , rather than renew it , we chose to downsize . The 150 sq m townhouse was just too big and empty for us . We also thought about how much we were paying in rent and utilities and thought we could find a place that suited us a little better . <p> We looked at over twenty serviced apartments and condos during one intense week of house hunting . We focused on places within a short walk- of the Old City as well as in the Nimmanhaemin and Suthep areas . We love the liveliness in main part of town and enjoy the convenience of being able to walk to restaurants and markets . <p> We were aiming for 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and wanted something with one bedroom , a Western kitchen and bathroom , and a washing machine . Oh , and it had to be cat friendly , which was the biggest determining factor for us . <h> Welcome to Our New House in Chiang Mai <p> We love everything about this two bedroom 75 sq m detached house . It 's brand new , just outside of the moat , and met all of our basic requirements . Although we agreed to a price that was a little outside of our budget , at- 14,000 baht per month ( $450 USD ) , there is nothing we do n't like . <p> We no longer live in a small neighborhood , but rather right off a small street . We have a gate that opens at the push of a button , a large brick driveway , and a small yard full of flowers and palm trees- that is cared for by our landlord . <p> The side of our house has a- covered porch area with built-in bench seating . It 's a perfect place to lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby rooster calls , monk chanting , and temple music- which we 've grown to enjoy and recognize as a nice part of living in Thailand . <h> Open Concept Living Room and Kitchen <p> There 's something to say about the first impressions of a place . We instantly loved the layout , the colors , and even the views from the windows . The choice in furniture , wall paint , and curtains made for a light , welcoming feel . <p> Our new house in Chiang Mai is half the size of our- old townhouse , but it came properly furnished and actually feels like a home . We have a soft couch with a TV and an entertainment center where we occasionally enjoy our- handful of English channels . <p> There- is- a very well made dining room table that we use as a- work area . No more shared space at a single desk like at our last place ! The table is against large vertically opening windows for maximum natural light . We also bought cushions for the wooden chairs to make them comfy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer area . The fact that the kitchen is n't in a separate room makes a big difference in how much we use it . On top of that , there are two gas burners , and that alone has given us the aspiration to cook again . We much- prefer the- gas burners over the- single induction burner that we had at our old townhouse ! <p> Although we brought over all of our cookware and dishes from our last place , this house came with a fully stocked kitchen and great cabinet space . It has a small fridge with a mini freezer , microwave , water heater , pans , and knives , as well as nice plates , bowls , and cups . We later learned from our landlord that our house was original intended to be rented out as a vacation home . <h> Bedrooms <p> The second half of the house consists of two bedrooms and two bathrooms . The bedrooms are n't too big but still fit a king sized bed , large wardrobe , and a vanity stand in each with comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bright green palm trees just outside of our window . <p> There is also an AC unit in each room that we sometimes use to quickly cool down the house on- hot days . The- guest- bedroom has a TV mounted on the wall and an ensuite bathroom . This was the first place we saw with painted walls , though pink would n't have been our first choice ! <h> Bathrooms <p> Although the showers are large and open with electric hot water heaters , our new bathrooms- are as close to Western bathrooms as we 've had since arriving in Thailand . We have an American Standard brand toilet , a modern sink , and a huge mirror . <p> We 've had no weird smells coming from the pipes in these bathrooms either , which was a welcomed change from our last place . Even though one of the showers has quirky grass tiles , we- are- actually really fond of them. - We even went a little crazy and- bought a shower curtain to match . <h> No More Unwelcome Visitors <p> Our new home- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors in our old townhouse let in large creepy crawlies more often than we liked . But in our new place , the only thing we 've experienced are ants and the little gecko lizards , which we are n't  bothered too much by . <p> We felt better prepared this time for the bugs ! The first thing we did was caulk up any small holes and put seals on the door frames . We also use the ant chalk and draw lines around windows and doors to discourage ants from coming in . We do our best at composting our cooking scraps outside rather than putting them in the trashcan under the sink . <h> Finding a House in Chiang Mai <p> We eventually found our house after looking through a ton of online listings . Although we asked our Thai friends if they knew of anyone renting out a place , and even looked for For Rent signs posted in Thai around the city , we did n't find any success through that avenue this second time around . <p> We couldnt- be happier with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is perfect for the two of us .

Any advice for getting a quick overview of what 's available for rent ? I was thinking about contacting a realtor ( i.e. Chiang Mai Properties ) to see if they could show us around . Also , any advice of what areas are the best , and which to avoid ( like the areas that flood ) ? Thanks in advance . <p> We 'd recommend going to anyone other than CM Properties .

Best of luck with your decision ! <p> Thailand is great place to work abroad . The fact that the cost of living is so cheap allows you to focus on other things than being a slave to your job . These kinds of posts also inspired us to move to Thailand back in the day ! <p> Thank you so much for your blog ! ! ! My family and I are seriously looking at making the big move to Thailand . I lived in Thailand for 3 years before and speak Thai more than enough to get by . Now though , I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . Thank you for your clear and honest views on living in Thailand . <p> That looks great , plenty big enough for our family of 4 and way bigger than our current London flat ! I think we pay that much per half week ! I see well have to get some help and advice from you guys for next year , it may be CM for us . <p> The light was a huge factor , especially after moving from our old place , which felt like a cave . We 'd love to see pictures of your new place ( haha , everyone does ! ) . We thought you had great taste in the condo you made that video on . Looking forward to meeting up again : ) <p> Wow . Still right at under $500 US . That 's encouraging ! Weve been scouting around looking at prices and have always seen more like $600 US for about the same thing and that 's without utilities . Oh well we wont be over there for another year and its probably better to just live on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search and get used to the neighborhoods . Great article you two . Thanks ! <p> We agree to find a temporary place and then take your time looking through listings for something long term . That 's how you find the best deals ! The good news is that rent prices have n't gone up much in the past twenty years ( so we 've heard ) , so you should still expect super low prices by the time you 're here next year . <p> What recommendations do you have for finding temporary housing in Chiang Mai ? My boyfriend and I arrive in October and are planning on staying a year . We would like to find some temporary housing while we get aquainted with the city and find something more permanent . Any websites or resources you could recommend would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks in advance ! <p> Google serviced apartments in Chiang Mai . They are great for short-term stays and provide things like linens , onsite water , and even cookware . This sure beats buying everything the first few days you 're in town like we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home that you 'll both be very happy in . Thanks for sharing especially the tips on creepie crawly defense initiatives its an important part of the selection process . We will definitely remember that one including pipe scents . <p> Great ! The first batch has n't  been added to in 2.5 months and should be ready to dump on the roses under the fountain soon . We started a second batch when we got back from the US and that 's going good too . Ants are generally at a minimum . Come back soon ! <p> Hi guys , Were finally on our way to CM in just a few weeks and will be there for a year on an ED Visa , as we plan to study Thai . We have been researching places online and want to stay in the 20,000 or under a month rent range . Even with that budget it is not easy to find something . Everything that is more modern or in the city such as a one bedroom serviced apartment starts at 20,000 and most have additional common area fees plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . If you have any Read more + <p> Hello Lori , it really takes a lot of hitting the streets and replying to ads online . We looked at over twenty places before settling on this one . There are plenty of very nice serviced apartments we found for around 15K baht a month . We will be posting a list of them soon . Take care and good luck . <p> Thank you both and we will definitely peruse your list when posted . Have already gotten in touch with some realtors too , to help narrow our search . Looking forward to getting there ! Hope to cross paths with you at some point . : ) <p> So nice of you to share such details as future expats are usually concerned not only about budget but what they can expect in term of size style and standards . Seems like you 've found the perfect place for you wish you all the best : ) <p> Thank you !

@@59574761 @8574761/ <h> Ups and Downs of Owning Pets in Thailand <p> Before moving to Thailand , we struggled with the decision to bring our cat and dog with us . We questioned whether owning pets in Thailand would be anything like owning pets- in the USA . At the time we were researching our move ( 2012 ) , we found little information on websites and forums that gave us hope or confirmed our fears . <p> Fast forward to 2016 . We 've spent the last three and a half years with our big ol American cat in Chiang Mai , Thailand and had our fair share of ups and downs . <p> Luckily its been relatively- easy to take care of our cat- in Thailand . He does n't  mind the hot weather and loves chasing bugs and lizards ( both outside and inside our house ) . After a lot of searching via- motorbike ( good luck with those online listings ! ) , we found a decent pet shop that has a good variety of everything he needs . And thanks to a friends recommendation , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor emergencies . Weve settled in nicely , but there are a few things we wish we 'd known before committing to being pet owners in Thailand . <p> For starters , we had no idea just how difficult it would be to find a pet-friendly home . Let 's be clear : there ARE- pet friendly 4+ bedroom family houses beyond the city limits . However , we had our hearts set on living near Chiang Mais city center but found out the hard way- that apartments and condos do n't  allow pets . <p> And to think if we brought our dog , - an- 85 lb American Bully , wed be pulling our hair out trying to find an affordable pet friendly residence with a fenced-in yard somewhere in town . ( From one dog owner to another , a fence is a- must-have , non-negotiable feature to- protect your dog from Thailands strays ) . Not to mention , he does n't  quite fit the cute , small dog look . Thatd make it a challenge to take him anywhere with us , something we were all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what pet friendly homes , daycare and boarding facilities , vets , and pet shops weve come found in Chiang Mai , sign up to be notified when our membership site- goes live . <p> Anyways , that 's just our experience . So we asked some of our fellow pet-owners to share their own stories . Here 's what they had to say in response to our questions : <h> 01 - What has been your experience with veterinary care in Thailand ? <p> Diana lived in Chiang Mai for three years and nursed her two cats , Lucky and Penelope , back to health after rescuing them from the city streets . <p> Vet care in Thailand can be hit or miss largely in part due to the language barrier . <p> I lived in Thailand for almost three years and worked with an animal sanctuary Elephant Nature Park during that time . Within my first week of living in Chiang Mai , I rescued a tiny little street kitten dying of parvo . I rushed him to the vet the park uses , Dr. Nook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up saving his life a couple of times , actually . Dr. Nook was thorough and always provided clear explanations of what was going on , not only for my cats ( I ended up with two ) , but also when I visited her with other animals rescued . She and her staff were caring and gentle they even consoled me when animals I cared for had to be put down . <p> However , not all veterinary practices are the same . I also had to rush my cat to a 24-hour hospital and he was misdiagnosed with parvo for a second time . ( Oddly enough the tests , which they showed me , came back negative ) . It is really important to find a vet other westerners use , or a vet that the animal sanctuaries use . These tend to be the ones with the most experience and updated facilities . <h> 02 - Any funny Thailand pet stories ? Any cautionary tales ? <p> Nick and Michael have lived in Thailand for two and a half years and brought their cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I arrived in Chiang Mai January 2014. - When we first moved to Chiang Mai we lived on the ground floor. - Our cat baby Karma is an indoor cat but a little outdoor avenger at heart . ( She has a record of escaping/sneaking out and not coming back until morning . ) <p> We noticed that some of the Chiang Mai neighborhood cats started to come around . They would stay ten feet from our screen door and meow . She would just stare at them . She never meowed. - This went on for a few weeks until one day I noticed a few cats scoping out our place , looking at Karma . <p> I did n't  really think anything of it. - UntilI opened the screen door to take out the trash and Karma bolted out the door full speed . This was her big escape that shed been planning . <p> I screamed for Michael . I was shocked and just stood there and did n't  do a thing . Michael ran outside in his underwear , panicked . ( Mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see and everyone was home because it was early evening . ) <p> I finally ran out after him and told him to go back inside . I chased Karma- down as she rounded the corner of another building . She looked lost , like she was thinking , " Where the hell am I ? " I was very calm and acted like shed done nothing wrong and snatched her up into my arms . <p> We thought that it was the end . Had we come all this way only for her to escape and join her stray cat friends ? Or worse , eaten by the local dog gang that we affectionately called , " The Rat Pack " . <p> Two and half years later , Karma is still enjoying Thailand and she 's has n't pulled any escape attempts since . <h> 03 - Has your view on pet ownership changed now that you live in Thailand ? <p> Kati and Elias have lived in Thailand for two years and bought their dog , Dara , in Chiang Mai when she was a puppy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an American , we often obsess over the things we do , which include taking care of our pets . Were told that our dog or cat must get their shots on a regimented schedule and that we must buy them the most expensive , high-end food . Otherwise were reprimanded or labeled as horrible pet parents . In the US , its not uncommon to be pressured into spending money on the best of the best but its nothing like that in- Thailand . <p> In the US , there 's also this mentality of hyper commitment . Yes , owning a dog is a commitment , but my world does n't  revolve around my dog , Dara . I adopted her- after moving to Thailand and I do n't  think of taking care of her " from feeding and giving her attention to the daily walks and yearly vet checks " as a life-consuming task . There 's a more a relaxed attitude in the Thailand courtesy of the sabai sabai mentality . I can make sure my dog is healthy and happy without going overboard . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pets in Thailand ? <p> Alana received her dog , Manee , as a gift a year after moving to Thailand. - <p> I had never had a pet before so I do n't  know what it would be like to have my dog in another country . But compared to my hometown of Seattle , Thailand does n't  seem particularly pet-friendly or accessible . <p> In Chiang Mai , for instance , its difficult to walk your dog because they are n't  allowed in the public parks . However , some owners pretend not to see the signs and sneak them in anyway . There are n't  any great spaces for walking and especially not for letting a dog off a leash . <p> Transportation can get tricky to if you rely on a motorbike . I sometimes ride with my dog on the bike with me but I could n't if she was much bigger . <h> 05 - What is the biggest difference in pet culture compared to your home country ? <p> We rescued our cat , MooShu , from an animal shelter in the USA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning pets in Thailand , most notably in breed preferences and treatment . <p> Breeds such as French Bulldogs , Pugs , - Chihuahuas , Terriers , Spaniels , as well as any toy dog breeds , are very popular . There is ample affection , toys , food , and other general resources for small dogs . Its common to see them- well-groomed , sometimes to the point of being dolled up with bows or flashy collars . Its arguably- quite cute ! Every once in a while we see them carried around in fashionable- doggie carriers or held in their owners arms like infants . However , Thailand does n't  seem to be as pet friendly towards cats or large dogs . In In- America , on the other hand , cats and dogs ( of all sizes ) - seem to be enjoyed relatively equally . <p> Also , many Thais look down on neutering/spaying and ( especially ) euthanasia . Although there are animals rescue centers that accept donations of street dogs and cats , there are still hordes of intact- strays roaming around who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strays is both a nuisance ( adjusting your route to avoid going- by territorial dogs , especially if you are taking- your own dog for a walk ) and a danger ( getting into a car or motorbike accident because a stray- dashed in front of your vehicle ) . This is opposite to the USA , in which strays are promptly picked up by a government- service and put in a shelter and eventually- put down if they are n't  adopted out . <p> If you own a pet in Thailand , what has your experience been like ? Leave a comment below . <p> I have a 19 year old cat that I brought with me from the US . Sadly , is not looking like shell make it back home . I 've heard that vets in Thailand do not euthanize , but if i was home , now would be the time . Does anyone know of a vet that can help ? I like in Bangkok . <p> Were sorry to hear this ! We know what a heavy decision this is . Although its difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . We 've heard that Sukhumvit Vet on Soi 51 will do it ( house calls , too ) as well as Thong Lor Pet Hospital and Ari Pet Hospital . Much love ! <p> Awesome blog , really helpful ! I move to CM with my indoor cat soon . Trying to figure out my housing options I approached the estate agency and they told me that there was no flats available for cat owners in CM and the only option was a house . I 'm single and definitely not a fan of suburbs and village lifestyle and would ideally prefer to live around Nimman or Suthep areas in a condo . Are there many small houses/townhouses in that area ? Is the situation with pet-ftiendly condo owners really that though ? Would it be easy to find something without agency ? <p> Hi Yana , thanks so much ! We have come across a few pet friendly condo listings in Chiang Mai over the years and know of at least one pet friendly serviced apartment on that side of the city called Flora House ( on Chan Kian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nimman and Suthep . We actually found our house without the help of an agency ( within a KM of the the old city ) . It was n't listed as pet friendly , but we were able to negotiate once meeting with the owner . For much broader insight we recommend posting your question Read more + <p> We rescued our dog ( a mini pinscher ) in Thailand . Having him there was awesome ( though finding a pet friendly apartment in Bangkok is nearly impossible ) , but taking him out of the country was a total pain . Vet care is high quality and very inexpensive ( AWESOME ) , but not entirely reliable . Getting all the paperwork we needed to export him out of the country and imported into another was a complete headache and involved a lot of phone calls , bribes , and chasing around . <p> Awesome summary . As far as exporting pets , we hear its a bit easier if you originally imported your pet into Thailand and kept that paperwork to show during the exportation . The exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . <p> I 'm back from visiting Chiang Mai with an eye toward retiring there soon . I have a big , smart , Balinese indoor/outdoor cat whom I 'm like to bring with me . In CM I stayed in the southern Haiya tambon . The soi dogs were very friendly ; none of them threw aggressive body language at me . Most were willing to let me approach and scratch behind the ear . Maybe some are " owned " and are allowed to wander , and some are truly strays . I met a Persian cat that was born three-legged and a couple of sweet old hair-dressers were caring for him outside in Read more + <p> We want people to be well informed about the different environment and pet culture in Thailand before they bring their pet all the way here , but it sounds like you 've witnessed very positive interaction with street dogs ( Yes , some are very sweet ! ) and the hairdressers caring for the three-legged cat . Of course , we wish you all the best when you bring your cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hello there I am moving to Chiang Mai to work at an international school for 1-2 years this summer . I have one adult cat . Is it really true that no apartment in the city let you have pets even small cats ? <p> Generally speaking , apartments and condos in Chiang Mai do not allow pets . However , some are more lenient than others ( and look the other way when pets are brought it ) or actually allow pets if you ask ( approved on a case by case basis ) . You are welcomed to sneak your cat in like we did , but you risk getting kicked out . The most hassle-free method is to look for a house or a condo . They are independently owned so you can speak directly with the landlord about your cat . Good luck its the Golden Question for anyone moving to Chiang Read more + <p> Nakornping condo on Soi Ratchaphruek rents to cats . I lucked out to find it . But I think all the units are full . I have lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for a cat . Nearly impossible , unless you get a house . And most listings on rental sites do not even talk about pets nor a pet / no pet policy filter . Just a different culture . A lot of people have cute little dogs . Pomeranians and chihuahuas . I can not imagine trying to walk a dog in the old city with the soi dogs . Our cat Read more + <p> Sounds like its in demand ! Yeah , our cat is an indoor cat , although we do let him out in our tiny fenced in yard under supervision . All it takes is one mean soi dog out of a hundred and our kitty is toast . <p> We relocated to Thailand from the UK around 16 months ago . We almost gave our cat up for adoption , but backed out at the last minute . she is part of the family after all and we just couldnt do it ! So there I Was in a mountain of paper work and googling how to get Lola the Persian cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that say to pay someone to do it , and to be honest I do n't  think you need to do that . I did it all myself . and whilst my paper work got bounced Read more + <p> Great to hear read your good-news story , Nicole . Not a bad price either ! We agree that you can save money if you do it all yourself and not fly cargo ( like we did a double whammy because the tickets were so expensive and because we were forced to use a pet shipper to professionally book the flight ) . Youll be happy to have your baby with you : ) <p> What was your experience flying them over ? We are moving from the U.S , and do n't  know much about how safe it is , and what others have experienced .

It was confusing but worked out just Read more + <p> Hi there ! My fiance and I plan to move there next July . We have two pooches , a puggle and a cockapoo . Both small dogs , are we are both anxious about flying them especially . Were not so worried about them living there , as we know we will stay with my family in a gated home . However , has anyone had experiencing flying them over there ? We having a hard time finding information on which airlines fly dogs , and how safe it is for them to fly under the plane . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ( different airlines service different countries ) . Have you thought about contacting a pet shipper ? They can save you loads of time ( were talking days of researching different airlines , flight policies , level of care , prices , etc ) and take the stress about coordinating everything off your shoulders . Be careful with your puggle some airlines also have restrictions on snub nose dog and cat breeds due complications with breathing during flights ( the airlines do n't  want to be liable ) . <p> To those that do n't  know whether to go to Thailand with their pets or not . I would highly recommend you take them . I really did n't  know what to leave them and felt the same as Connie but its a no option , especially as we love our two pooches so much . I would recommend going a few times without the dogs and see where you like . I have been going to Phuket and Chiang Mai for over 6 years and I would feel confident to take them . Its certainly a must to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read more + <p> Visiting your future Thai town to scout out an area you like and make pet friendly connections is definitely ideal .

That certainly takes a big weight off the shoulders . <p> We brought our two cats 18 months ago from Malaysia to Thailand , short distance so pretty hassle free , also because of the excellent information we found here . The oldest one was already accompying us when we moved from the Netherlands to Malaysia and we also brought her to Singapore when we lived there .
