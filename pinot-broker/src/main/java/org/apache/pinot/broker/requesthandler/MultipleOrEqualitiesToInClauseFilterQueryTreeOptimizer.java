  /**
   * Optimize FilterQueryTree rooted at OR. We look at the immediate children
   * of OR from two different scenarios:
   *
   * (1) The immediate child could be a IN or an EQUALITY operator
   * (2) The immediate child could be other operators -- AND, NOT, RANGE, BETWEEN etc
   *
   * We first go over the immediate children and collect the operators
   * in two separate data structures.
   *
   * (1) is maintained in a map of column name to unique set of 1 or more
   * predicate values. For this we also track in a local variable whether
   * the predicates in the map need to be rewritten or not. This decision
   * is made by {@link #collectChildOperatorsOfRootOROperator(FilterQueryTree,
   * Map, List)} method as it builds the data structure
   *
   * (2) is maintained in a simple list of FilterQueryTrees representing the
   * non EQUALITY/IN operators. Also, as {@link #collectChildOperatorsOfRootOROperator
   * (FilterQueryTree, Map, List)} builds this list, it also optimizes these set of
   * FilterQueryTrees.
   *
   * We first deal with a very special case where the entire filter just has one column
   * and there aren't any non EQUALITY/IN operators. Few examples to represent this
   * scenario:
   *
   * A = 100 OR A = 200 OR A = 300
   * A IN (100) OR A IN (200) OR A IN (300)
   * A = 100 OR A = 200 OR A = 300 OR A IN (200, 300, 400, 500, 600)
   *
   * We simply remove OR and return a FilterQueryTree with leaf operator
   * -- if the number of values is 1, use EQUALITY
   * -- else use IN
   *
   * If this scenario is not applicable, we only need to look if EQUALITY/IN set
   * of child operators need to be rewritten. This is already tracked in the
   * boolean variable so we just need to check that.
   *
   * If the  variable is false, then we are done and return.
   * Else, we go over each predicate in map, rewrite it and in the end append the
   * list of non EQUALITY/IN operators (note hat these were already optimized as
   * part of collect method). Finally, we return the root of this optimized tree
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * a IN (1) OR b IN (2) -- two IN operators and zero other operators
   * both IN operators can be rewritten to EQUALITY
   *
   * a IN (100) OR b = 300 -- one IN and one EQUALITY operator,
   * zero other operators, IN can be rewritten
   *
   * a = 100 OR b = 300 -- two equality and zero other operators
   * nothing needs to be rewritten
   *
   * a = 1 OR b = 2 OR c > 20 -- two equality and one other operator
   * nothing needs to be rewritten

   * a IN (1) OR b IN (2) OR c > 20 -- two IN operators and one other operators
   * both IN operators can be rewritten to EQUALITY and other operator need not
   * be rewritten
   *
   * a IN (1) OR b IN (2) OR (c > 20 AND a > 200)
   * two IN operators and AND other operator. both IN can be rewritten
   * and for AND we can't decide unless we drill down so we recurse.
   *
   * a = 1 OR b = 2 OR (c > 20 AND a > 200)
   * two EQUALITY operators and AND other operator.
   * both EQUALITY need not be rewritten
   * and for AND we can't decide unless we drill down so we recurse
   *
   * a = 1 OR b = 2 OR (c IN (20) AND a > 200)
   * two EQUALITY operators and AND other operator.
   * both EQUALITY need not be rewritten
   * and for AND we can't decide unless we drill down so we recurse --
   * the recursion will return the AND tree with the inner IN rewritten
