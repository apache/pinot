/**
 * Instance selector for strict replica-group routing strategy.
 *
 * <pre>
 * The strict replica-group routing strategy always routes the query to the instances within the same replica-group.
 * (Note that the replica-group information is derived from the ideal state of the table, where the instances are sorted
 * alphabetically in the instance state map, so the replica-groups in the instance selector might not match the
 * replica-groups in the instance partitions). The goal of this algorithm is to ensure that segments from the same
 * partition are never served from multiple different instances. The instances in a replica-group should have all the
 * online segments (segments with ONLINE/CONSUMING instances in the ideal state and selected by the pre-selector)
 * available (ONLINE/CONSUMING in the external view) in order to serve queries. If any segment is unavailable in the
 * replica-group, we mark the whole replica-group down and not serve queries with this replica-group.
 *
 * The selection algorithm is the same as {@link ReplicaGroupInstanceSelector}, and will always evenly distribute the
 * traffic to all replica-groups that have all online segments available.
 *
 * The algorithm relies on the mirror segment assignment from replica-group segment assignment strategy. With mirror
 * segment assignment, any server in one replica-group will always have a corresponding server in other replica-groups
 * that have the same segments assigned. For example, if S1 is a server in replica-group 1, and it has mirror server
 * S2 in replica-group 2 and S3 in replica-group 3. All segments assigned to S1 will also be assigned to S2 and S3. In
 * stable scenario (external view matches ideal state), all segments assigned to S1 will have the same enabled instances
 * of [S1, S2, S3] sorted (in alphabetical order). If we always pick the same index of enabled instances for all
 * segments, only one of S1, S2, S3 will be picked, and all the segments are processed by the same server. In
 * transitioning/error scenario (external view does not match ideal state), if a segment is down on S1, we mark all
 * segments with the same assignment ([S1, S2, S3]) down on S1 to ensure that we always route the segments to the same
 * replica-group.
 *
 * Note that new segments won't be used to exclude instances from serving when the segment is unavailable.
 * </pre>
