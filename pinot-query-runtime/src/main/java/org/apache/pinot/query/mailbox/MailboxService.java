   * the OpChain. There are two ways in which a MailboxService may release its references to a ReceivingMailbox and
   * the underlying resources:

   * <ol>
   *   <li>
   *     If the OpChain corresponding to a ReceivingMailbox was closed or cancelled. In that case,
   *     {@link MailboxReceiveOperator} will call this method as part of its close/cancel call. This is the main
   *     reason why this method exists.
   *   </li>
   *   <li>
   *     There can be cases where the corresponding OpChain was never registered with the scheduler. In that case, it
   *     is up to the {@link MailboxService} to ensure that there are no leaks of resources. E.g. it could setup a
   *     periodic job to detect such mailbox and do any clean-up. Note that for this case, it is not mandatory for
   *     the {@link MailboxService} to use this method. It can use any internal method it needs to do the clean-up.
   *   </li>
