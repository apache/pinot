/**
 * This is a scheduler that schedules operator chains in round robin fashion,
 * but will only schedule them when there is work to be done. The availability
 * of work is signaled using the {@link #onDataAvailable(MailboxIdentifier)}
 * callback.
 * <p>
 *   Design: There are 3 states for a OpChain:
 *
 *   1. Ready: This state means that an OpChain is ready to be run. If an OpChain is in this state, then it would be in
 *             the _ready queue. The _ready queue is polled on every call to {@link #next}.
 *   2. Available/Yielded: This is when the OpChain was run and it returned a no-op block, indicating that it has no
 *                         new data to process. The {@link OpChainId} for these OpChains are stored in the _available
 *                         map, where the value of the map is the release-timeout.
 *   3. Running: When the OpChain is returned by the {@link #next} method, it is considered to be in the Running state.
 *
 *   The following state transitions are possible:
 *   1. Ready ==> Running: This happens when the OpChain is returned by the {@link #next} method.
 *   2. Running ==> Available/Yielded: This happens when a running OpChain returns a No-op block, following which a
 *                                     yield is called and there's no entry for the OpChain in _seenMail.
 *   3. Available/Yielded ==> Ready: This can happen in two cases: (1) When yield is called but _seenMail has an
 *                                   entry for the corresponding OpChainId, which means there was some data received
 *                                   by MailboxReceiveOperator after the last poll. (2) When a sender has died or hasn't
 *                                   sent any data in the last _releaseTimeoutMs milliseconds.
 *
 *                      |--------------( #yield() )---------|
 *                      |                                   |
 *                     \/                                   |
 *   [ START ] --> [ READY ] -----------( #next() )--> [ RUNNING ]
 *                     /\                                   |
 *                     |                                    |
 *         ( #seenMail() or #periodic())                    |
 *                     |                                    |
 *                [ AVAILABLE ] <------( #yield() )---------|
 *                                                          |
 *                                                          |
 *   [ EXIT ] <-----------------( #deregistered() )---------|
 *
 *   The OpChain is considered "alive" from the time it is registered until it is de-registered. Any reference to the
 *   OpChain or its related metadata is kept only while the OpChain is alive. The {@link #onDataAvailable} callback
 *   can be called before an OpChain was ever registered. In that case, this scheduler will simply ignore the callback,
 *   since once the OpChain gets registered it will anyways be put into the _ready queue immediately. In case the
 *   OpChain never gets registered (e.g. if the broker couldn't dispatch it), as long as the sender cleans up all
 *   resources that it has acquired, there will be no leak, since the scheduler doesn't hold any references for
 *   non-alive OpChains.
 * </p>
