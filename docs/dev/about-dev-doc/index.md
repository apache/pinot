# About developer documentation

The developer documentation is written using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and 
[Material for MkDocs][material-for-mkdocs].
The documentation of both projects is a good place to start if you are new to MkDocs.

MkDocs is a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.
Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Ideally significant changes to the codebase should be accompanied by changes to the developer documentation
to keep it up to date.
