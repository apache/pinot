# Dev docs code style

This document describes the code style for Pinot development.
Given the documentation is written as code (in this case, Markdown), the code style is important to ensure consistency 
and readability.

Code style is always a matter of personal preference, but it is important to have a consistent style across the
documentation.

In order to reduce discussions about code style, we define the documentation code style by decoration.
By default, we use the [Google Markdown Style][style_guid] for documentation code style.
Contributors should read the Google Markdown Style before contributing to the documentation.

But there are some modifications to the Google Markdown Style that we use in Pinot documentation:

1. *Character line limit*: We use a character line limit of 120 characters, similar to what we use in the codebase.
