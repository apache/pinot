Git
---
Pinot uses git for source code management. If you are new to Git, it will be good to review `basics <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics>`_ of Git and a common tasks like `managing branches <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell>`_ and `rebasing <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing>`_.

Getting the Source Code
-----------------------
Create a fork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To limit the number of branches created on the Apache Pinot repository, we recommend that you create a fork by clicking on the fork button `in this page <https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot>`_.
Read more about `fork workflow here <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow>`_

Clone the repository locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

  $ mkdir workspace
  $ cd workspace
  $ git clone git@github.com:<github username>/pinot.git
  $ cd pinot
  # set upstream
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot
  # check that the upstream shows up correctly
  $ git remote -v

Maven
-----
Pinot is a Maven project and familiarity with Maven will help you work with Pinot code. If you are new to Maven, you can
read about Maven `here <maven.apache.org>`_ and `get a quick overview here <http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html>`_.

Run the following maven command to setup the project.

.. code-block:: none

  # compile, download sources
  $mvn install package -DskipTests -Pbin-dist -DdownloadSources -DdownloadJavadocs

Setup IDE
---------
Import the project into your favorite IDE. Setup stylesheet according to your IDE. We have provided instructions for
intellij and eclipse. If you are using other IDEs, please ensure you use stylesheet based on
`this <https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/blob/master/config/codestyle-intellij.xml>`_.
