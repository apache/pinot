 * {@link PinotDataDistribution} at node level, the question is whether we should assign this so that number of streams
 * is equal to the sender or the receiver.
 * <p>
 *   We have chosen to set it based on the receiver. The idea being that after PhysicalExchange is added, the trait
 *   constraints should ideally be satisfied between the receiver and the Exchange node. This is similar to how Calcite
 *   thinks of trait enforcement via Converter Rules.
