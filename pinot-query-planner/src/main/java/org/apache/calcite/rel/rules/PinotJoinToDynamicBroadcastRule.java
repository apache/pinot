 *
 * <p> The next part to extend the Dynamic broadcast into the Proj/Filter operator happens in the runtime.
 *
 * <p> This rewrite is only useful if we can ensure that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>new plan can leverage the indexes and fast filtering of the leaf-stage Pinot server processing logic.</li>
 *   <li>
 *     data sending over xChange should be relatively small comparing to data would've been selected out if the dynamic
 *     broadcast is not applied.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     since leaf-stage operator can only process a typical Pinot V1 engine chain-operator chain. This means the entire
 *     right-table will be ship over and persist in memory before the dynamic broadcast can occur. memory foot print
 *     will be high so this rule should be use carefully until we have cost-based optimization.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     if the dynamic broadcast stage is broadcasting to a left-table that's pre-partitioned with the join key, then the
 *     right-table will be ship over and persist in memory using hash distribution. memory foot print will be
 *     relatively low comparing to non-partitioned.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     if the dynamic broadcast stage operating on a table with the same partition scheme as the left-table, then there
 *     is not going to be any network shuffling overhead. both memory and latency overhead will be low.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * TODO #1: Only support SEMI-JOIN, once JOIN operator is supported by leaf-stage we should allow it to match
 *   @see <a href="https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10565/>
 * TODO #2: Only convert to dynamic broadcast from right-to-left, allow option to specify dynamic broadcast direction.
 * TODO #3: Only convert to dynamic broadcast if left is leaf stage, allow the option for intermediate stage.
 * TODO #4: currently adding a pass-through after join, support leaf-stage to chain arbitrary operator(s) next.
